ThunderX was launched at the end of August 2020. Soon after launching, weaknesses were found in the code, that allowed decrypting the files that the malware encrypted. The group has fixed the code and publish a new version, then released it under the name Ranzy Locker. The Tor onion URL used by the Ranzy Leak site is the same as the one used by Ako Ransomware. The use of the same URL could indicate that both groups merged, or they are cooperating similarly to the Maze cartel.\n",
