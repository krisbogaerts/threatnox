  "description": "TellYouThePass Gang has been running the TellYouThePass ransomware campaign since 2019, and is known for exploiting n-day vulnerabilities. The gang uses the Windows mshta.exe binary to run a malicious HTML application (HTA) file containing VBScript with a base64-encoded string. This string decodes into a binary, loading a .NET variant of the ransomware into the host&#x27;s memory. The ransomware then sends an HTTP request disguised as a CSS resource request to a command-and-control server and encrypts files on the infected machine. A ransom note, &quot;READ_ME10.html,&quot; is left on the system with instructions for the victim on how to restore their files.",
