  "description": "The Cyber Army of Russia is a threat group that appears to carry out cyber attacks in line with Russian strategic interests. The group has claimed many distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against a variety of targets perceived as opposed to Russian interests. More recently, it has claimed disruptive industrial software-based attacks against water utilities in the United States, France, and Poland. Researchers link the Cyber Army of Russia to APT44 / Sandworm Team, although it remains unclear what level of direct support, if any, is provided by the latter group.<sup>[[Wired Cyber Army of Russia April 17 2024](/references/53583baf-4e09-4d19-9348-6110206b88be)]</sup><sup>[[Mandiant APT44 April 17 2024](/references/a64f689e-2bb4-4253-86cd-545e7f633a7e)]</sup>",
