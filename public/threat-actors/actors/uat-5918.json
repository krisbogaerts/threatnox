  "description": "UAT-5918 is an APT group that targets entities in Taiwan, primarily in telecommunications, healthcare, and IT sectors, to establish long-term access for information theft. They exploit N-day vulnerabilities in unpatched web and application servers to gain initial access and utilize web shells, credential harvesting tools like Mimikatz and LaZagne, and red-teaming tools for post-compromise activities. UAT-5918 conducts network reconnaissance to pivot across endpoints, harvesting credentials and sensitive data, including database backups. Their operations show significant overlap with other APT groups in terms of TTPs and targeted industries.",
