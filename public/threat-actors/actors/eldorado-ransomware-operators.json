Researchers assess that Eldorado is a \"unique\" ransomware strain that is likely not derived from previously leaked ransomware source code.<sup>[[Group-IB July 3 2024](/references/50148a85-314c-4b29-bdfc-913ab647dadf)]</sup>\n\nWindows and Linux-focused versions of the ransomware are known to exist. (ATT&CK Techniques associated with these malware binaries are tracked in a separate \"Eldorado  Ransomware\" Software object.)",
