  "description": "This object reflects the ATT&CK Techniques associated with threat actors who deploy BlackSuit, a ransomware capable of running on Windows and Linux systems. BlackSuit is believed to be a successor to Royal, a ransomware operation which itself derives from the notorious Russia-based Conti gang. BlackSuit operations were first observed in May 2023, and although they were relatively low in number, U.S. authorities issued a warning for healthcare sector organizations due to the ransomware's suspected pedigree.<sup>[[HC3 Analyst Note BlackSuit Ransomware November 2023](/references/d956f0c6-d90e-49e8-a64c-a46bfc177cc6)]</sup> The number of attacks claimed by BlackSuit operators increased notably in Q2 2024.<sup>[[GitHub ransomwatch](/references/62037959-58e4-475a-bb91-ff360d20c1d7)]</sup>\n\nATT&CK Techniques associated with the BlackSuit ransomware binary are tracked in a separate \"BlackSuit  Ransomware\" Software object.",
