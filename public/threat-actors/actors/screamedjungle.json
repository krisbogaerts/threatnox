This actor has harvested millions of browser fingerprints by leveraging vulnerabilities such as CVE-2024-34102 and CVE-2024-20720. ScreamedJungle utilizes PerfectCanvas technology to ensure pixel-perfect replication of legitimate user fingerprints. Group-IB analysts estimate that over 115 e-commerce sites have been impacted by this fingerprint theft campaign.",
