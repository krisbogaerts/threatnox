  "description": "Asnarök is a threat actor that exploited CVE-2020-12271 and utilized command injection privilege escalation to gain root access to devices and install the Asnarök Trojan and demonstrated significant changes in TTPs, including the deployment of a web shell that did not reach out to external C2 for commands. X-Ops identified a patient-zero device linked to the attack and observed the use of an IC.sh script that stole local user account data. The actor's activities were linked to a broader pattern of malicious exploit research and targeted vulnerabilities disclosed by bug bounty researchers.",
