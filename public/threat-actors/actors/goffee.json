  "description": "GOFFEE is a threat actor that has targeted entities in the Russian Federation since early 2022, employing spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, including modified Owowa and patched explorer.exe. They have utilized PowerTaskel, a non-public Mythic agent in PowerShell, and introduced a new implant called \"PowerModul\" for attacks against sectors such as media, telecommunications, and government. GOFFEE has increasingly shifted to a binary Mythic agent for lateral movement and has incorporated Word documents with malicious VBA scripts in their infection chains. The group has demonstrated a consistent evolution in their TTPs while maintaining identifiable characteristics that attribute their campaigns with high confidence.",
