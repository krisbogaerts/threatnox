[Metador](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1013) has targeted a limited number of telecommunication companies, internet service providers, and universities in the Middle East and Africa. Security researchers named the group [Metador](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1013) based on the \"I am meta\" string in one of the group's malware samples and the expectation of Spanish-language responses from C2 servers.(Citation: SentinelLabs Metador Sept 2022)",
