  "description": "[Saint Bear](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1031) is a Russian-nexus threat actor active since early 2021, primarily targeting entities in Ukraine and Georgia. The group is notable for a specific remote access tool, [Saint Bot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1018), and information stealer, [OutSteel](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1017) in campaigns. [Saint Bear](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1031) typically relies on phishing or web staging of malicious documents and related file types for initial access, spoofing government or related entities.(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 OutSteel SaintBot February 2022 )(Citation: Cadet Blizzard emerges as novel threat actor) [Saint Bear](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1031) has previously been confused with [Ember Bear](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1003) operations, but analysis of behaviors, tools, and targeting indicates these are distinct clusters.",
