  "description": "Storm-0940 is a Chinese threat actor active since at least 2021, known for gaining initial access through password spray and brute-force attacks, as well as exploiting network edge applications. Microsoft has observed Storm-0940 utilizing valid credentials obtained from CovertNetwork-1658's password spray operations, indicating a close operational relationship between the two. Once inside a victim environment, Storm-0940 has been seen leveraging compromised credentials for further malicious activities. Additionally, Storm-0940 has employed botnets, such as Quad7, to facilitate password spraying attacks.",
