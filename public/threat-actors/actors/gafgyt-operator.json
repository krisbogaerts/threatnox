  "description": "GAFGYT, also known as BASHLITE, is a Linux-based IoT botnet first discovered in 2014. It primarily targets vulnerable IoT devices to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Early versions of GAFGYT exploited the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-7169) for initial access, along with router-specific flaws like CVE-2017-17215 (Huawei), CVE-2017-18368 (ZYXEL), and CVE-2014-8361 (Realtek). Compromised devices receive backdoor commands from a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server and can download additional payloads.",
