Technical analysis of [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1129) ransomware indicates variants capable of targeting Windows or VMWare ESXi hypervisors and multiple overlaps with [Conti](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575) ransomware.(Citation: BushidoToken Akira 2023)(Citation: CISA Akira Ransomware APR 2024)(Citation: Cisco Akira Ransomware OCT 2024)",
