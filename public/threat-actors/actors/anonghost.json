In October 2023, following a series of air- and land-based attacks in the Gaza Strip, AnonGhost was one of several hacktivist groups that claimed responsibility for disruptive attacks against computer networks in Israel. Researchers indicated that they observed AnonGhost actors exploit an undisclosed API vulnerability in Red Alert, an application that provides warning of projectile attacks in Israel, using Python scripts to intercept web requests and send spam messages to the app's users.<sup>[[Group-IB Threat Intelligence Tweet October 9 2023](/references/2df546ed-6577-44b2-9b26-0a17c3622df7)]</sup>",
