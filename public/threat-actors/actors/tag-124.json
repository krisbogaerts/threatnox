  "description": "TAG-124 is a threat actor that employs a traffic distribution system to distribute malware, primarily using MintsLoader and targeting various sectors through phishing emails and compromised websites. The actor injects malicious JavaScript into WordPress sites, leading victims to fake Google Chrome update landing pages that facilitate malware downloads, often masquerading as legitimate updates. TAG-124 has been linked to multiple ransomware groups, including Rhysida and Interlock, and demonstrates high activity levels by regularly updating its infrastructure and refining its infection tactics, such as the ClickFix technique. Notable compromised sites include those associated with the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).",
