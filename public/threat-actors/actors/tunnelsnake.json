  "description": "The TunnelSnake campaign demonstrates the activity of a sophisticated actor that invests significant resources in designing an evasive toolset and infiltrating networks of high-profile organizations. By leveraging Windows drivers, covert communications channels and proprietary malware, the group behind it maintains a considerable level of stealth. That said, some of its TTPs, like the usage of a commodity webshell and open-source legacy code for loading unsigned drivers, may get detected and in fact were flagged by Kaspersky's product, giving them visibility into the groupâ€™s operation.",
