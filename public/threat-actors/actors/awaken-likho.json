The group has been active since at least December 2021 and has ramped up its activities following the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Recent reports indicate that they are focusing on espionage against critical infrastructure in the defense and energy sectors. Analysis of their malware reveals a new version that is still in development, suggesting ongoing operational capabilities.",
