  "description": "MirrorFace is a Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat group that has been targeting high-value organizations in Japan, including media, government, diplomatic, and political entities. They have been conducting spear-phishing campaigns, utilizing malware such as LODEINFO and MirrorStealer to steal credentials and exfiltrate sensitive data. While there is speculation about their connection to APT10, ESET currently track them as a separate entity.",
