There's also a crossover between victims with Black Basta. Both are RaaS and have a long list of known and unknown affiliates. Having said that, this is possibly an affiliate (likely a cybergroup) of both of those groups. The Alliance & Association would technically be Encryptor Sharing, but this is realistically more of an \"Old Affiliate\" that created their own ransomware encryptor and operation.",
