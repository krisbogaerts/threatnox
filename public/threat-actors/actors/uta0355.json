  "description": "UTA0355 is a Russian threat actor that conducts phishing campaigns targeting individuals and organizations associated with Ukraine. The actor initiates contact via email, inviting targets to a video conference, and follows up through Signal or WhatsApp to enhance legitimacy. After establishing communication, UTA0355 prompts victims to log in via a malicious M365 URL, subsequently requesting approval for a 2FA authentication to access email data. Volexity assesses with high confidence that UTA0355 successfully registered devices and downloaded email data from compromised accounts.",
