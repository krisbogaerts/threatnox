  "description": "Storm-2139 is a cybercrime group that exploited stolen API keys from compromised Azure OpenAI Service accounts to generate harmful content, including non-consensual intimate imagery, using the DALL-E model. The group utilized reverse proxy infrastructure and custom software to bypass guardrails in Microsoftâ€™s GenAI services. Microsoft has filed a lawsuit against four individuals associated with Storm-2139, alleging they modified customer systems and resold access to these capabilities. The group systematically harvested authentication tokens from U.S.-based enterprises and is linked to a broader network of illicit AI tool development and distribution.",
