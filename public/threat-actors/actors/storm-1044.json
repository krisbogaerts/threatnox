  "description": "Storm-1044 has been identified as part of a cyber campaign in collaboration with Twisted Spider. They employ a strategic approach, targeting specific endpoints using an initial access trojan called DanaBot. Once they gain access, Storm-1044 initiates lateral movement through Remote Desktop Protocol sign-in attempts, passing control to Twisted Spider. Twisted Spider then compromises the endpoints by introducing the CACTUS ransomware. Microsoft has detected ongoing malvertising attacks involving Storm-1044, leading to the deployment of CACTUS ransomware.",
