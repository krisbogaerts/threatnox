They use a custom backdoor named Merdoor, developed since 2018, and employ various tactics to gain access, including phishing emails, SSH credential brute-forcing, and exploiting server vulnerabilities. Additionally, Lancefly has been observed using a newer version of the ZXShell rootkit and tools like PlugX and ShadowPad RAT, which are typically associated with Chinese-speaking APT groups.",
