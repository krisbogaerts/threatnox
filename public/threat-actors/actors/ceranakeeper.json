The group employs custom backdoors like TONESHELL and OneDoor, leveraging cloud services such as Dropbox and OneDrive for data exfiltration. CeranaKeeper utilizes techniques like side-loading, brute-force attacks, and the deployment of BAT scripts to extend its reach within compromised networks. Their operations are characterized by a relentless pursuit of sensitive data, adapting their toolset and methods to evade detection.",
