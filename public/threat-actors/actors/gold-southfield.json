[GOLD SOUTHFIELD](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0115) provides backend infrastructure for affiliates recruited on underground forums to perpetrate high value deployments. By early 2020, [GOLD SOUTHFIELD](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0115) started capitalizing on the new trend of stealing data and further extorting the victim to pay for their data to not get publicly leaked.(Citation: Secureworks REvil September 2019)(Citation: Secureworks GandCrab and REvil September 2019)(Citation: Secureworks GOLD SOUTHFIELD)(Citation: CrowdStrike Evolution of Pinchy Spider July 2021)",
