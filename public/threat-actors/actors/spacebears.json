  "description": "SpaceBears is a ransomware group believed to be based in Moscow, Russia, that has taken credit for several high-profile cyberattacks while primarily operating as a Data Broker. They currently list eight organizations on their Data Leak Site, focusing on medium to small-sized targets. Their methods suggest a reliance on basic extortion strategies rather than sophisticated malware tactics, with no advanced techniques or indicators of ransomware detected.",
