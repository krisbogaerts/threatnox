  "description": "Gitloker is a threat actor group targeting GitHub repositories, wiping their contents, and extorting victims for their data. They use stolen credentials to compromise accounts, claim to have created a backup, and instruct victims to contact them on Telegram. The attackers leave a ransom note in the form of a README file, urging victims to negotiate the return of their data. GitHub is working to combat these evolving attacks and the vulnerabilities they exploit.",
