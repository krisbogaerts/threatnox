Associated with the broader [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) umbrella of actors, [AppleJeus](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1049) has been active since at least 2018 and is closely aligned in resources with TEMP.hermit, another DPRK-affiliated group under the same umbrella.(Citation: dtex DPRK 2025 structure ITworkers) The group’s primary mission is to generate and launder revenue to provide financial support to the government. [AppleJeus](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1049) primarily targets the cryptocurrency industry and is most notably responsible for the [3CX Supply Chain Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0057).(Citation: Mandiant 3cx UNC4736 2023) The group traditionally deploys malicious cryptocurrency software in combination with [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). From these compromised environments, it selectively deploys additional backdoors to enable extended operations against high-value financial targets.(Citation: Mandiant DPRK Groups 2023)(Citation: JPCert Blog Laz Subgroups 2025)",
