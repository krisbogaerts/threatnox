  "description": "A pro-Hamas hacktivist group developed a wiper called BiBi-Linux to target and destroy data on Israeli systems. The malware impersonates ransomware but operates solely to corrupt and delete files, indicating no data theft. A Windows variant, BiBi-Windows, was also discovered, sharing similarities with BiBi-Linux but targeting all files except executables. ESET researchers have named the group behind the wipers BiBiGun. The group's TTPs have shown overlaps with Moses Staff, which is believed to have an Iran nexus.",
