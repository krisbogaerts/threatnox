They often create fake social media profiles, particularly posing as recruiters, to trick victims into running malware on their computers. Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit has taken legal action and seized 41 domains used by Bohrium to disrupt their activities. The group has shown a particular interest in sectors such as technology, transportation, government, and education.",
