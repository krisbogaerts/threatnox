  "description": "GamaCopy is a threat actor first discovered in June 2023, known for launching cyberattacks against Russiaâ€™s defense and critical infrastructure sectors by mimicking the TTPs of Gamaredon. The organization has been active since at least August 2021 and primarily uses Russian-language bait documents related to military facilities. Analysis of attack samples shows considerable overlap in code structure and tactics, including the use of 7z-SFX documentation to install UltraVNC and connecting via port 443. GamaCopy employs open-source tools to obfuscate its activities while targeting sensitive information in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
