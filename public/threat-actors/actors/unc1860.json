  "description": "UNC1860 is a persistent and opportunistic Iranian state-sponsored threat actor that is likely affiliated with Iranâ€™s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). A key feature of UNC1860 is its collection of specialized tooling and passive backdoors that Mandiant believes supports several objectives, including its role as a probable initial access provider and its ability to gain persistent access to high-priority networks, such as those in the government and telecommunications space throughout the Middle East.",
