The threat actor behind the campaign has been active since at least 2019 and continues to operate. The attack chain involves the delivery of a malicious iMessage attachment that launches a series of exploits, ultimately leading to the deployment of the TriangleDB implant. Kaspersky researchers have discovered and reported multiple vulnerabilities used in the campaign, with patches released by Apple.",
