The actor utilizes RDGA patterns to create over 2,600 domains, hosted on multiple dedicated IPs, and employs a cloaking service for validation checks on user leads. Their campaigns have included themes such as Baltic Pipe financial scams and spoofing well-known platforms like WhatsApp and Google Finance. The most prevalent campaign theme involves a spoofed news article from \"Channel One\" promoting the \"GazInvest\" platform with promises of high returns.",
