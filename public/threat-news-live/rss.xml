I was partly right. But the longer I’ve stayed, the more I’ve realized that the engineers who thrive aren’t necessarily the best programmers - they’re the ones who’ve figured out how to navigate everything around the code: the people, the politics, the alignment, the ambiguity.These lessons are what I wish I’d known earlier. Some would have saved me months of frustration. Others took years to fully understand. None of them are about specific technologies - those change too fast to matter. They’re about the patterns that keep showing up, project after project, team after team.I’m sharing them because I’ve benefited enormously from engineers who did the same for me. Consider this my attempt to pay it forward.1. The best engineers are obsessed with solving user problems.It’s seductive to fall in love with a technology and go looking for places to apply it. I’ve done it. Everyone has. But the engineers who create the most value work backwards: they become obsessed with understanding user problems deeply, and let solutions emerge from that understanding.User obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock. The engineer who truly understands the problem often finds that the elegant solution is simpler than anyone expected.The engineer who starts with a solution tends to build complexity in search of a justification.2. Being right is cheap. Getting to right together is the real work.You can win every technical argument and lose the project. I’ve watched brilliant engineers accrue silent resentment by always being the smartest person in the room. The cost shows up later as “mysterious execution issues” and “strange resistance.”The skill isn’t being right. It’s entering discussions to align on the problem, creating space for others, and remaining skeptical of your own certainty.Strong opinions, weakly held - not because you lack conviction, but because decisions made under uncertainty shouldn’t be welded to identity.3. Bias towards action. Ship. You can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank one.The quest for perfection is paralyzing. I’ve watched engineers spend weeks debating the ideal architecture for something they’ve never built. The perfect solution rarely emerges from thought alone - it emerges from contact with reality. AI can in many ways help here.First do it, then do it right, then do it better. Get the ugly prototype in front of users. Write the messy first draft of the design doc. Ship the MVP that embarrasses you slightly. You’ll learn more from one week of real feedback than a month of theoretical debate.Momentum creates clarity. Analysis paralysis creates nothing.4. Clarity is seniority. Cleverness is overhead.The instinct to write clever code is almost universal among engineers. It feels like proof of competence.But software engineering is what happens when you add time and other programmers. In that environment, clarity isn’t a style preference - it’s operational risk reduction.Your code is a strategy memo to strangers who will maintain it at 2am during an outage. Optimize for their comprehension, not your elegance. The senior engineers I respect most have learned to trade cleverness for clarity, every time.5. Novelty is a loan you repay in outages, hiring, and cognitive overhead.Treat your technology choices like an organization with a small “innovation token” budget. Spend one each time you adopt something materially non-standard. You can’t afford many.The punchline isn’t “never innovate.” It’s “innovate only where you’re uniquely paid to innovate.” Everything else should default to boring, because boring has known failure modes.The “best tool for the job” is often the “least-worst tool across many jobs”-because operating a zoo becomes the real tax.6. Your code doesn’t advocate for you. People do.Early in my career, I believed great work would speak for itself. I was wrong. Code sits silently in a repository. Your manager mentions you in a meeting, or they don’t. A peer recommends you for a project, or someone else.In large organizations, decisions get made in meetings you’re not invited to, using summaries you didn’t write, by people who have five minutes and twelve priorities. If no one can articulate your impact when you’re not in the room, your impact is effectively optional.This isn’t strictly about self-promotion. It’s about making the value chain legible to everyone- including yourself.7. The best code is the code you never had to write.We celebrate creation in engineering culture. Nobody gets promoted for deleting code, even though deletion often improves a system more than addition. Every line of code you don’t write is a line you never have to debug, maintain, or explain.Before you build, exhaust the question: “What would happen if we just… didn’t?” Sometimes the answer is “nothing bad,” and that’s your solution.The problem isn’t that engineers can’t write code or use AI to do so. It’s that we’re so good at writing it that we forget to ask whether we should.8. At scale, even your bugs have users.With enough users, every observable behavior becomes a dependency - regardless of what you promised. Someone is scraping your API, automating your quirks, caching your bugs.This creates a career-level insight: you can’t treat compatibility work as “maintenance” and new features as “real work.” Compatibility is product.Design your deprecations as migrations with time, tooling, and empathy. Most “API design” is actually “API retirement.”9. Most “slow” teams are actually misaligned teams.When a project drags, the instinct is to blame execution: people aren’t working hard enough, the technology is wrong, there aren’t enough engineers. Usually none of that is the real problem.In large companies, teams are your unit of concurrency, but coordination costs grow geometrically as teams multiply. Most slowness is actually alignment failure - people building the wrong things, or the right things in incompatible ways.Senior engineers spend more time clarifying direction, interfaces, and priorities than “writing code faster” because that’s where the actual bottleneck lives.10. Focus on what you can control. Ignore what you can’t.In a large company, countless variables are outside your control - organizational changes, management decisions, market shifts, product pivots. Dwelling on these creates anxiety without agency.The engineers who stay sane and effective zero in on their sphere of influence. You can’t control whether a reorg happens. You can control the quality of your work, how you respond, and what you learn. When faced with uncertainty, break problems into pieces and identify the specific actions available to you.This isn’t passive acceptance but it is strategic focus. Energy spent on what you can’t change is energy stolen from what you can.Every abstraction is a bet that you won’t need to understand what’s underneath. Sometimes you win that bet. But something always leaks, and when it does, you need to know what you’re standing on.Senior engineers keep learning “lower level” things even as stacks get higher. Not out of nostalgia, but out of respect for the moment when the abstraction fails and you’re alone with the system at 3am. Use your stack.But keep a working model of its underlying failure modes.12. Writing forces clarity. The fastest way to learn something better is to try teaching it.Writing forces clarity. When I explain a concept to others - in a doc, a talk, a code review comment, even just chatting with AI - I discover the gaps in my own understanding. The act of making something legible to someone else makes it more legible to me.This doesn’t mean that you’re going to learn how to be a surgeon by teaching it, but the premise still holds largely true in the software engineering domain.This isn’t just about being generous with knowledge. It’s a selfish learning hack. If you think you understand something, try to explain it simply. The places where you stumble are the places where your understanding is shallow.Teaching is debugging your own mental models.13. The work that makes other work possible is priceless - and invisible.Glue work - documentation, onboarding, cross-team coordination, process improvement - is vital. But if you do it unconsciously, it can stall your technical trajectory and burn you out. The trap is doing it as “helpfulness” rather than treating it as deliberate, bounded, visible impact.Timebox it. Rotate it. Turn it into artifacts: docs, templates, automation. And make it legible as impact, not as personality trait.Priceless and invisible is a dangerous combination for your career.14. If you win every debate, you’re probably accumulating silent resistance.I’ve learned to be suspicious of my own certainty. When I “win” too easily, something is usually wrong. People stop fighting you not because you’ve convinced them, but because they’ve given up trying - and they’ll express that disagreement in execution, not meetings.Real alignment takes longer. You have to actually understand other perspectives, incorporate feedback, and sometimes change your mind publicly.The short-term feeling of being right is worth much less than the long-term reality of building things with willing collaborators.Every metric you expose to management will eventually be gamed. Not through malice, but because humans optimize for what’s measured.If you track lines of code, you’ll get more lines. If you track velocity, you’ll get inflated estimates.The senior move: respond to every metric request with a pair. One for speed. One for quality or risk. Then insist on interpreting trends, not worshiping thresholds. The goal is insight, not surveillance.16. Admitting what you don’t know creates more safety than pretending you do.Senior engineers who say “I don’t know” aren’t showing weakness - they’re creating permission. When a leader admits uncertainty, it signals that the room is safe for others to do the same. The alternative is a culture where everyone pretends to understand and problems stay hidden until they explode.I’ve seen teams where the most senior person never admitted confusion, and I’ve seen the damage. Questions don’t get asked. Assumptions don’t get challenged. Junior engineers stay silent because they assume everyone else gets it.Model curiosity, and you get a team that actually learns.17. Your network outlasts every job you’ll ever have.Early in my career, I focused on the work and neglected networking. In hindsight, this was a mistake. Colleagues who invested in relationships - inside and outside the company - reaped benefits for decades.They heard about opportunities first, could build bridges faster, got recommended for roles, and co-founded ventures with people they’d built trust with over years.Your job isn’t forever, but your network is. Approach it with curiosity and generosity, not transactional hustle.When the time comes to move on, it’s often relationships that open the door.When systems get slow, the instinct is to add: caching layers, parallel processing, smarter algorithms. Sometimes that’s right. But I’ve seen more performance wins from asking “what are we computing that we don’t need?”Deleting unnecessary work is almost always more impactful than doing necessary work faster. The fastest code is code that never runs.Before you optimize, question whether the work should exist at all.19. Process exists to reduce uncertainty, not to create paper trails.The best process makes coordination easier and failures cheaper. The worst process is bureaucratic theater - it exists not to help but to assign blame when things go wrong.If you can’t explain how a process reduces risk or increases clarity, it’s probably just overhead.And if people are spending more time documenting their work than doing it, something has gone deeply wrong.Early in your career, you trade time for money - and that’s fine. But at some point, the calculus inverts. You start to realize that time is the non-renewable resource.I’ve watched senior engineers burn out chasing the next promo level, optimizing for a few more percentage points of compensation. Some of them got it. Most of them wondered, afterward, if it was worth what they gave up.The answer isn’t “don’t work hard.” It’s “know what you’re trading, and make the trade deliberately.”Expertise comes from deliberate practice - pushing slightly beyond your current skill, reflecting, repeating. For years. There’s no condensed version.But here’s the hopeful part: learning compounds when it creates new options, not just new trivia. Write - not for engagement, but for clarity. Build reusable primitives. Collect scar tissue into playbooks.The engineer who treats their career as compound interest, not lottery tickets, tends to end up much further ahead.Twenty-one lessons sounds like a lot, but they really come down to a few core ideas: stay curious, stay humble, and remember that the work is always about people - the users you’re building for and the teammates you’re building with.A career in engineering is long enough to make plenty of mistakes and still come out ahead. The engineers I admire most aren’t the ones who got everything right - they’re the ones who learned from what went wrong, shared what they discovered, and kept showing up.If you’re early in your journey, know that it gets richer with time. If you’re deep into it, I hope some of these resonate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anti-aging injection regrows knee cartilage and prevents arthritis</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/anti-aging-injection-regrows-knee-cartilage-and-prevents-arthritis/</link><author>nis0s</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 15:13:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: An interactive guide to how browsers work</title><link>https://howbrowserswork.com/</link><author>krasun</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 15:08:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[1.

Sites were built with tables, not divs. Dreamweaver felt like a life hack. Designs were sliced in Photoshop. Databases lived in phpMyAdmin.It probably didn’t feel like it at the time, but looking back, those were simpler days. The entire  of the development cycle could fit in my head. There was complexity in building web applications, but it was all . If you had an idea, you could probably build it.As a solo developer, you could manage . From idea to execution. Or at least, it  that way.I’m probably romanticizing the past, but you get the idea.Today, it’s hard to do web development .On the frontend, you have build pipelines, bundlers, CSS frameworks with their own toolchains, progressive web apps, Core Web Vitals, SEO, layout shifts, srcset/responsive images… I remember when the biggest challenge was IE6 compatibility.On the backend, there are design patterns, unit tests, code coverage, APIs, performance concerns, dependency management, infrastructure, monitoring, log tracing, observability…Each area of expertise has grown up - probably for the better - but it also demands deeper . I chose to specialize in backend and server infrastructure. I had to step back from frontend work because I couldn’t keep up with its tooling  developing my backend skills.As a solo developer, it’s now  harder to manage .Leveling the playing field#They’re far from perfect, but  and  gave me the leverage I desperately needed. They’ve brought me back to levels of productivity I haven’t felt in years. I feel like I can manage the entire stack again - with confidence.I can go from idea to execution in days.Suddenly, the complexity of each domain matters a lot less.Oh no, you’re vibe coding - bet it’s all slop and code noise!Over the past two decades, I’ve worked with  of talented people: backend developers, frontend developers, marketers, leaders, and more. I can lean on those experiences, fall back on how  did things, and implement  with AI.I can reliably reproduce  coding standards, tone of voice, tactics, and processes. Starting a new project once felt insurmountable. Now, it feels realistic again.When AI generates code, I know when it’s good and when it’s not. I’ve seen the good and the bad, and I can iterate from there. Even with refinement and back-and-forth prompting, I’m easily 10x more productive with AI than without it.The goal hasn’t changed: build quality software that meets modern standards. The goalpost is still far out. But now I have a rocket-powered soccer ball - and I can finally reach it again.There’s mental space for creativity in building software again.My head isn’t constantly full of build pipelines, testability concerns, code patterns, unfixed bugs… I’m confident I can cover that with help from AI. It still needs to be done, but it’s done so much faster - and it no longer feels overwhelming.That leaves room to experiment with UI and UX, to try ideas and throw them away. To add small quality-of-life improvements I couldn’t justify before, because there was always something more urgent.It’s also not the  of code that I really enjoy, nor is it the syntax or structure or boilerplate that’s required to build anything. It’s the fact you get to build  out of , writing code was just how you got there. And with today’s tooling, that saves  of time.AI really has made web development fun again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Unbearable Joy of Sitting Alone in a Café</title><link>https://candost.blog/the-unbearable-joy-of-sitting-alone-in-a-cafe/</link><author>mooreds</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 14:37:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s contradictory to sit alone in a café. It’s against the reason cafés exist.They are designed as meeting spaces. There is no table with a single chair. Even the ones placed right by the window with high seating are big tables with many chairs.Cafés are community spaces. Most go there to see their loved ones, friends, or colleagues.You find only a few people sitting alone. Most are buried in their laptops, working hard to make a living in their own worlds, whatever world they have.When I took time off from work, I chose a staycation. Unlike most of my friends, who visited Japan in 2025.When I heard their experiences, I was jealous. When I told them my staycation plans of doing nothing for four weeks, they were jealous.While off work, I wanted to slow time down as much as I could. The best way to freeze time, I read somewhere, is to get a dog. Luckily, I have one already. So, I took long walks with my dog.What used to feel like 10 minutes between breakfast and lunch while working became a full-blown day. Even though I was spending two hours walking my dog instead of a 30-40 minute rush, it felt like an eternity. A peaceful eternity.On the second day, I decided to leave my phone at home, so I lived those two hours to the fullest. I didn’t take any device that could connect me to the internet or to other people.But all the anxiety evaporated after 30 minutes.I felt free, so to speak.It wasn’t that nobody could reach out to me that felt like an escape; it was that  couldn’t reach out to  or  that caused the turmoil.I had no possibility to text anyone. No possibility to watch or read. No chance to look up anything to fulfill my curiosity.My mind was alone after a long time.There were a few moments I put my hand into my pocket to take out my phone to look up something I was curious about. My phone wasn’t there.I smiled. Every. Single. Time.On the second day, I randomly walked into a neighborhood café. I ordered an americano with a double shot of espresso.Sipping a hot americano feels different when you are in a rush to catch a subway. Its purpose is to wake you up. A sip from that little hole in a single-use cap burns my tongue every time. I despise that.With a porcelain cup, you don’t have that. Coffee changes its purpose. It becomes a pleasure.I sat down with a proper cup of americano. My dog crawled under the table.I was sitting alone in a café with a dog that had crawled under the table without any electronics that could distract me.Distract me from, basically, nothing.It was pure delight. Every element. Or rather, the non-existence of any element. No phone. No headphones. No tablet. No laptop.My mind was just drifting with the chatter in the café. I left myself to the flow.When you let your thoughts wander, they take you on a journey you’ll never think possible. You reflect on the smallest details of your fast life. Your brain absorbs all the mistakes you’ve made. You accept that you can’t change failures anymore, as much as you feel guilty.You might as well not worry about them and focus on what you can change: what you do now. And what you will do next.The next day, I left my phone at home again and decided to stop by the same café. I was lucky; I sat down at the same table.Sitting alone in a café without distractions reveals a lot about people. The same people you pass by in a split second while rushing from home to work, from a meeting to a meeting. The invisible suddenly appears right in front of you. People don’t go away in two seconds. They stay. They sip a coffee. They talk with others, laugh, cry, and worry. Oh, worry.Worry is only visible in people’s eyes. Eyes are the channel of the heart. You have to close your ears and look at people’s eyes to see their hearts.You realize that looking into eyes is frightening—both for you and the other person. You try to avoid it, but eventually make eye contact because nobody is physically moving anywhere.As none of you are passing by in a second, you mimic looking at something else. They continue their conversation. But you saw their worry, and you can’t help but try to understand.You leave the café to avoid making things awkward.I went there the next day. This time, my table was occupied. I don’t know when it became my table. But it felt like that. I found another one. It was closer to the staff.Sitting alone in a café without distractions shows you how a café works. You never contemplate how they operate behind that giant coffee machine while you’re waiting for your coffee before you run to catch the next bus, tram, subway, or taxi. You never ruminate when you sip from a single-use cup and burn your tongue.You notice how the staff circulates porcelain cups, from dirty to clean, to the top of the coffee machine. You observe the staff’s reactions to each customer. You try to analyze if someone is a regular by noticing how the staff talks.You wonder whether they consider you a regular, since you’ve been there for the last couple of days. Or they call you . You will never know. You’re not fine with never knowing.You promise yourself to come the next day to observe how the staff talks to you.I again went to the same café. Unlucky me. A different staff were working on that day. Yet I ordered the same: a cup of americano with a double shot of espresso.Sitting alone in a café without distractions, with a dog that had crawled under the table, brings a light to a truth: you can’t control or influence other people’s thoughts and feelings, no matter what you do. Staff may think of you as a weirdo with a dog; your friends might want to be in your place; your family might be nervous because they can’t reach out to you.You know you can’t change any of those unless you change who you are. It makes you feel alone and powerless.You are alone and powerless. You encounter a deep challenge.The next day, I didn’t go to the café. I instead took an even longer walk. I went there the following day, knowing I had faced that challenge in my longest walk.Sitting alone in a café without distractions shows everyone you’re alone.A scary but powerful one.Many avoid at all costs. That’s why everybody looks at you with wondering eyes. They are afraid of your powerful joy. They can’t grasp why someone would do this to themselves. They are hesitant but are thinking of doing the same.Then you realize you’re planting thoughts in people’s minds that you can’t control. Feelings are feelings. Thoughts are thoughts.Just at the moment you think you are alone again, you see another weirdo across the café sitting alone without distractions. That weirdo is looking at your sleeping-in-a-croissant-shape dog under the table. Weirdo is enjoying the moment, while your dog is on an adventure in her second dream.You smile. You know you’re not alone. You are one weirdo sitting at a distance from one other. You know there are many.Maybe one of them is reading this and feeling heard. Perhaps one will never see this and will always feel alone. But it only needs one look around. You glance over the café and leave with a smile.The next day, I went there again. This time, I put in an intentional distraction. A good one.Sitting alone in a café without distractions only gets better when there is something to write on. Not with a keyboard. You must use your single hand to write, not two. Ideally, with a pen on paper.The pen is meant to slow you down. The words shouldn’t land on paper at the speed of thinking or even talking.The writing must hurt your wrist or hand. It must turn into a burden. That pain is a signal telling you that you have written long enough. Maybe you wrote only five lines. Perhaps one thousand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Street Fighter II, the World Warrier (2021)</title><link>https://fabiensanglard.net/sf2_warrier/</link><author>birdculture</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 14:30:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Understanding the bin, sbin, usr/bin, usr/sbin split (2010)</title><link>https://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-December/074114.html</link><author>csmantle</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 13:49:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jeffgeerling.com has been migrated to Hugo</title><link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/migrated-to-hugo/</link><author>mikece</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 12:57:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since 2009, this website has run on Drupal. Starting with Drupal 6, and progressing through major site upgrades and migrations to 7, 8, 9, and 10, I used the site as a way to dogfood the same CMS (Content Management System) I used in my day job for .Not to mention, the blog is a passion project. I use it as a scratchpad for thoughts, and deeper dives for my YouTube videos. Time spent maintaining a complex CMS is time I can't spend actually  (not to mention time spent on everything else in life!).I've moved other hobby sites to static hosting. For older sites I don't actively update, I scrape and mothball them. But for sites I wanted to keep active, I converted them to Jekyll or Hugo, both of which are competent and full-featured modern SSGs (Static Site Generators).Anyway, I've been working on the migration in this GitHub issue, and there are bound to be mistakes, broken image references, and probably some old URLs that just go !I try to keep everything where it is, or add redirects. But with 20 years of baggage and 3500+ posts (many of those were individual photos converted into 'blog' nodes in a prior upgrade... oops!), it's hard to run a perfect migration.I've been writing all my posts in Markdown since 2020, and even before that, was drafting them in Markdown in Sublime Text, then exporting that to HTML via MarkdownPreview.So having a tool (Hugo) that uses Markdown natively is a breath of fresh air.Beyond that, I've grown fond of 'sticking to the defaults' over the years. On my initial Drupal 6 site, I installed something like 30 modules (plugins in Drupal parlance), but almost all of those modules bit me in one way or another as I upgraded to Drupal 7, 8, 9, or 10...Honestly, upgrading from 8 to 9 to 10 was easier than 6 to 7 and 7 to 8, simply because I had stripped my site down to the basics., in so doing, I also made my content authoring experience a bit horrid:Write a blog post on my computer in a Markdown fileCreate new unpublished Drupal blog postPaste the Markdown content into the body and add a titleIndividually upload each picturePut cursor where each picture goes in the content, scroll down to the uploaded picture, click 'Insert' to insert the preformatted  markup, and rinse-and-repeat for all images (sometimes up to 25-30 per post!).Clear out the 'Authored on' field to make sure the date would update when I publish the postToggle the 'Published' option and save the nodeRun an Ansible playbook to drop Drupal caches, Nginx caches, and trigger a Cloudflare purge of the relevant URLs (ongoing DDoSes since 2022 caused me to  lock down my caching)...It was a . Just to publish a blog post—and none of that helped with writing or being creative, it was just a bunch of work., I could automate each step in Drupal. There are even modules for Drupal, like Scheduler for scheduling posts and updating publish dates, and Cloudflare for purging CDN cache... but you know what? I used to use those modules, but after four Drupal upgrade cycles, I was burned out on managing patches for months, years, or  since some of the modules took that long to have a stable release for [current Drupal version].And don't get me started on having to rebuild entire content authoring workflows (e.g. WYSIWYG editors, media management, and content fields) every time a major Drupal version was released! That specific type of churn, thankfully, is not  bad these days, but it was  bad prior to Drupal 10 or so.For , since my workflow already started with a Markdown file... the whole process is done after step 1, basically.To publish, I guess I  have to update the  in my post's frontmatter, and change  to , but that's about it. hugo && git commit -m "Updated post." && git push and the blog is up to date!And for maintenance, don't get me started on managing Composer, Drush, PHP, MariaDB, Nginx, Cloudflare, etc. — for an enterprise website, with multiple content workflows, dozens or hundreds of users with RBAC, etc., sure, it's fine. But for a blog where I just want to  and , it has been wearing me down for the past few years.Comments will be missing site-wide initially, as I've chosen to tackle a self-hosted static site commenting system in a 'phase two'. I love having comments enabled, despite the moderation overhead, and don't think blogging is the same without them.I also loved having integrated site search, since I use my blog as a project journal, referencing it often. The Drupal site was integrated into an Apache Solr search instance I also ran as part of Hosted Apache Solr... which I sunset years ago at this point. So I'll have to decide how I want to implement search within Hugo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FreeBSD Home NAS, part 3: WireGuard VPN, routing, and Linux peers</title><link>https://rtfm.co.ua/en/freebsd-home-nas-part-3-wireguard-vpn-linux-peer-and-routing/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 11:55:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am continuing to set up my home server on FreeBSD 14.3, which is intended to serve as a NAS.The main idea is to (finally!) connect my “office” and my apartment, and later, perhaps, also connect the server where rtfm.co.ua is currently running so that blog files and database backups can be stored directly on the ZFS mirror pool of the home server.All posts in this blog series:When it came to choosing which specific VPN server to use, I initially thought about OpenVPN – since I’ve worked with it for years, and there are even some blog posts about it on RTFM.However, after giving it some thought, I decided that for a home VPN, solutions like OpenVPN or Pritunl would be a bit of overkill, and I could give WireGuard a try.The systems are very different, but in short:WireGuard has a much smaller codebase – for example, the Linux implementation is about 4,000 lines in the kernel, while OpenVPN is about 100,000 lines in user spaceWireGuard works as a kernel module – packet processing and cryptography are performed directly in kernel space, whereas OpenVPN is a user space service that operates through a TCP or UDP socket and interacts with the kernel via the standard kernel network stackThe same applies to encryption, as WireGuard has built-in cryptography that is part of the protocol itself and runs in kernel space, while OpenVPN uses the standard SSL/TLS stack (OpenSSL, LibreSSL, etc.) in user space, which adds complexity and CPU/RAM overheadWireGuard’s operational model is peer-to-peer – meaning the protocol has no built-in “server” or “client” roles, only Peers with keys and allowed IPs, whereas OpenVPN is built around a classic client-server architectureAs a result, WireGuard can be perceived not as a separate service, but as an encrypted network interface, while OpenVPN remains a classic application-based VPN service.“office”: a separate local network 192.168.0.0/24, with a TP-LINK Archer AX12 router at the entry
this network contains a work laptop with Arch Linux and a Lenovo ThinkCentre with FreeBSDthe FreeBSD machine will host the NAS, NFS, and WireGuard itself
although the Archer AX12 has its own built-in OpenVPN and WireGuard – I want to do it myself, manually, for more controlhome: a 192.168.100.0/24 network with the exact same Archer AX12 router
the only client there is a home laptop with Arch LinuxAnd here is what I want to achieve:FreeBSD will act as the WireGuard VPN serverThe Archer AX12 router will have NAT port-forwarding to connect to WireGuard on FreeBSDVPN network – 10.8.0.1/24Packet Filter firewall on FreeBSD to control trafficBoth laptops should have access to each other and to the future NAS on FreeBSDHere is how it looks schematically:In FreeBSD (just like in Linux), WireGuard consists of a kernel module + userspace tools: the main “working” part is loaded as a kernel module, and a separate package is installed to interact with it.root@setevoy-nas:/home/setevoy # pkg install wireguard-toolsroot@setevoy-nas:/home/setevoy # kldload if_wgroot@setevoy-nas:/home/setevoy # kldstat | grep wg
 8    1 0xffffffff82a47000    2f5c0 if_wg.koEnable WireGuard in :root@setevoy-nas:/home/setevoy # sysrc wireguard_enable=YES
wireguard_enable:  -> YES
root@setevoy-nas:/home/setevoy # sysrc wireguard_interfaces=wg0
wireguard_interfaces:  -> wg0Don’t start it yet – let’s move on to network configuration.Next, the system needs to be configured to route packets between the physical interface and the WireGuard interface, and the firewall config needs an update.Enable IP forwarding from the  interface (which doesn’t exist yet, it will appear when WireGuard starts) to the LAN interface, .Update the autostart in :root@setevoy-nas:/usr/local/etc/wireguard # sysrc gateway_enable="YES"
gateway_enable: NO -> YESTo enable forwarding immediately without a reboot – turn it on using :root@setevoy-nas:/usr/local/etc/wireguard # sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 0 -> 1
root@setevoy-nas:/usr/local/etc/wireguard # sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 1
The next step is configuring Packet Filter.So, here is what we have:Office network where FreeBSD/VPN is located: 192.168.0.0/24
FreeBSD LAN IP: 192.168.0.2Routing internet through VPN is not required – only traffic between the home and office networksThe current  config is minimalist, from the previous post:allowed_tcp_ports = "{ 22 }"

allowed_clients = "{ 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24 }"

set skip on lo

Reloading pf rules.Now we can prepare to start WireGuard.Everything is very simple here – create the keys, write the config file.Communication and cryptography in WireGuard are built on a standard asymmetric key scheme:The private key is stored on the “server”The public key is specified on the clientDuring the handshake, the client verifies it is connecting to the correct server whose public key it knowsAfterward, data encryption is performed using these keysI’m putting the word “server” in quotes because, as mentioned earlier, WireGuard is P2P, not client-server.After installing , the  directory is created – navigate there and create the private and public keys using :root@setevoy-nas:/home/setevoy # cd /usr/local/etc/wireguard
root@setevoy-nas:/usr/local/etc/wireguard # wg genkey | tee server.key | wg pubkey > server.pub
Change the permissions for the private key:root@setevoy-nas:/usr/local/etc/wireguard # chmod 600 server.keyroot@setevoy-nas:/usr/local/etc/wireguard # ll

Since we don’t have any clients yet – let’s move on to setting them up.To connect from home to the FreeBSD host with WireGuard – add port forwarding on the office router:external port on the router:  (to mask it slightly from bots)forward to:  (the FreeBSD host)forward to port:  (WireGuard on  on FreeBSD)On the TP-Link Archer AX12, it looks like this:If the internet IP in the office is dynamic – the Archer AX12 has a Dynamic DNS setting:On Linux, the process is identical – the modules are in the kernel, so we just need to install the package with the tools.root@setevoy-home:/home/setevoy # lsmod | grep wireguard

Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/[email protected]' → '/usr/lib/systemd/system/[email protected]'.At this point, almost everything is ready – access is established, and everything is working.However, I also want to have direct access from the home laptop to the work laptop and vice versa, as the work laptop doesn’t have a VPN – it doesn’t need one because FreeBSD/NAS is in the same local network.So what needs to be done is to set up direct access between the laptops in the home network (192.168.100.0/24) and the office network (192.168.0.0/24), because currently access between the work laptop and the home laptop doesn’t work.The situation is currently as follows:Office laptop IP: Home laptop IP: No WireGuard on the work laptopNo connection from the office to the home laptopNo connection from home to the work laptopConnection from home to FreeBSD existsWhile setting this up – comment out  in ; we’ll return to it later.The result of what we’re about to do will look like this: the key is the routes. I’ve specifically made this as a diagram to make the following steps easier to understand:Check the routes from the home laptop to FreeBSD:root@setevoy-home:/etc/wireguard # ip route get 192.168.0.2
192.168.0.2 dev wg0 src 10.8.0.3 uid 0root@setevoy-home:/etc/wireguard # ip route get 192.168.0.165
192.168.0.165 dev wg0 src 10.8.0.3 uid 0Traffic goes through , and the Source Address for the packet is set as .However, on the work laptop, the route to the home laptop goes through 192.168.0.1:[setevoy@setevoy-work ~] $ ip route get 192.168.100.205
192.168.100.205 via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0 src 192.168.0.165 uid 1000Here, 192.168.0.1 is the default gateway, the office router, which knows nothing about the home network 192.168.100.0/24.So first – add a route to the home network via the FreeBSD host:[setevoy@setevoy-work ~] $ sudo ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 via 192.168.0.2[setevoy@setevoy-work ~] $ ip route get 192.168.100.205
192.168.100.205 via 192.168.0.2 dev wlan0 src 192.168.0.165 uid 1000Now there is contact from the office to home:[setevoy@setevoy-work ~] $ ping 192.168.100.205 -c 1

Please don’t use this as justification to write bad code, okay? Okay.First of all, why  comments explain ‘what’? If you need comments to explain what’s going on, it suggests your code is unclear. If I write//weight, radius, price
w = 10, r = 9, p = 1
That’s not as clear as sayingweight = 10, radius = 9, price = 3
“But it’s obvious that  is !” Sure, if you’re seeing those lines back-to-back. But presumably you’re initializing the variable to use it, which means that it’s going to appear later. When you see  later in the body, you need to go back and check what it is. That’s a frustrating context switch and you may skip it, possibly assuming that  is… width. Then bad things happen. So comments are not a substitute for clean code.Okay,  so why  comments explain why? Some people argue that we should instead store the ‘why’ in commit messages or tests. Most people feel icky about this, though. Given:// Clear twice to deal with bug ABC in library XYZ, see [link]
XYZ.clear(); XYZ.clear();
Would you prefer that comment be removed and placed in the commit message? Then if you want to learn why  is repeated twice, you have to dig up the commit. That can be a difficult and tedious job, especially if the line was reformatted, moved between files, anything that makes  not work. Searching all that is a context switch and you may skip it, possibly assuming that it’s a bug you can remove. Then bad things happen.Both of these cases share the same problem: looking things up is hard. Best case it’s a context switch that takes time away from understanding the problem. Worst case you don’t look it up and make a potentially-dangerous assumption. It’s better to keep the information in the exact same place that you need it, whether that’s via descriptive code or comments over commits.Now for the weird part. What if your descriptive code forces a context switch? Let’s take the code from Bob Martin’s Extract Till You Drop.To make it more understandable, he replaces it with this:So much better, right?!  is now two lines instead of ten. But now there’s six other methods you have to read to understand how the class works. “But it’s easier to follow.” Not if I’m trying to track down a bug and I have to keep scrolling up and down, jumping from method to method to understand the whole. Is that really so much better than using comments?I think that’s more understandable than either the original case or the clean code case, because you don’t have to context switch to a different method to understand what’s going on. Obviously this isn’t always the case, and often comments are superfluous. I’m just saying that there are at least a few cases where writing a ‘what’ comment is the right choice, so we shouldn’t reject them out-of-hand.Welp that’s my argument so flame war awaaaaaaaaaay]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Gentle Seduction (1989)</title><link>http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/GentleSeduction.html</link><author>JumpCrisscross</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 08:35:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can I start using Wayland in 2026?</title><link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-01-04-wayland-sway-in-2026/</link><author>secure</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 08:11:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Wayland is the successor to the X server (X11, Xorg) to implement the graphics
stack on Linux. The Wayland
project was actually started in 2008, a year before I created the i3 tiling
window manager for X11 in 2009 — but for the last 18 years
(!), Wayland was never usable on my computers. I don’t want to be stuck on
deprecated software, so I try to start using Wayland each year, and this
articles outlines what keeps me from migrating to Wayland in 2026.For the first few years, Wayland rarely even started on my machines. When I was
lucky enough for something to show up, I could start some toy demo apps in the
demo compositor Weston.Around 2014, GNOME started supporting Wayland. KDE followed a few years later.
Major applications (like Firefox, Chrome or Emacs) have been slower to adopt
Wayland and needed users to opt into experimental implementations via custom
flags or environment variables, until very recently, or — in some cases, like
 — still as of today.Unfortunately, the driver support situation remained poor for many years.  With
nVidia graphics cards, which are the only cards that support my 8K
monitor, Wayland would either not work at all
or exhibit heavy graphics glitches and crashes.Modern Linux distributions like Asahi Linux (for
Macs, with their own GPU driver!) clearly consider Wayland their primary desktop
stack, and only support X11 on a best-effort basis.So the pressure to switch to Wayland is mounting! Is it ready now? What’s
missing?Most importantly for this article, I use a Dell 8K 32"
monitor (resolution: 7680x4320!), which, in my
experience, is only compatible with nVidia graphics cards (I try other cards
sometimes).Hence, both the lab PC and my main PC contain an nVidia GPU:The lab PC contains a nVidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti.The main PC contains a nVidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.(In case you’re wondering why I use the older card in my PC: I had a crash once
where I suspected the GPU, so I switched back from the 4070 to my older 3060.)For many years, nVidia drivers were entirely unsupported under Wayland.Apparently, nVidia refused to support the API that Wayland was using, insisting
that their EGLStreams approach was superior. Luckily, with nVidia driver 495
(late 2021), they added support for GBM (Generic Buffer Manager).But, even with GBM support, while you could now start many Wayland sessions, the
session wouldn’t run smoothly: You would see severe graphics glitches and
artifacts, preventing you from getting any work done.The solution for the glitches was  support: because the nVidia
driver does not support  (like AMD or Intel), Wayland (and
wlroots, and sway) needed to get explicit sync
support.Sway 1.11 (June 2025) and wlroots 0.19.0 are the first version with explicit
sync support.Not working: TILE support for 8K monitorWith the nVidia driver now working  with Wayland, unfortunately that’s
still not good enough to use Wayland in my setup: my Dell UP3218K
monitor requires two DisplayPort 1.4
connections with MST (Multi Stream Transport) and  support. This
combination worked just fine under X11 for the last 8+ years.While GNOME successfully configures the monitor with its native resolution of
7680x4320@60, the monitor incorrectly shows up as two separate monitors in sway.But, even with the  patch, my monitor would not work correctly: The right
half of the monitor would just stay black. The full picture is visible when
taking a screenshot with , so it seems like an output issue. I had a few
exchanges about this with  starting in August 2025 (thanks for taking
a look!), but we couldn’t figure out the issue.A quarter later, I had made good experiences regarding debugging complex issues
with the coding assistant Claude Code
(Opus 4.5 at the time of writing), so I decided to give it another try. Over two
days, I ran a number of tests to narrow down the issue, letting Claude analyze
source code (of sway, wlroots, Xorg, mesa, …) and produce test programs that I
could run manually.Ultimately, I ended up with a minimal reproducer program (independent of
Wayland) that shows how the  DRM property does not work on nVidia (but
does work on Intel, for example!): I posted a bug report with a video in the
nVidia
forum
and hope an nVidia engineer will take a look!Crucially, with the bug now identified, I had Claude implement a workaround:
copy the right half of the screen (at ) to another buffer, and then
display , but with .With that
patch
applied, for the first time, I can use Sway on my 8K monitor! 🥳By the way, when I mentioned that GNOME successfully configures the native
resolution, that doesn’t mean the monitor is usable with GNOME! While GNOME
supports tiled displays, the updates of individual tiles are not synchronized,
so you see heavy tearing in the middle of the screen, much worse than anything I
have ever observed under X11. GNOME/mutter merge request
!4822 should
hopefully address this.During 2025, I switched all my computers to NixOS. Its
declarative approach is really nice for doing such tests, because you can
reliably restore your system to an earlier version.To make a Wayland/sway session available on my NixOS 25.11 installation, I added
the following lines to my NixOS configuration file ():I also added the following Wayland-specific programs to environment.systemPackages:Note that activating this configuration kills your running X11 session, if any.Just to be sure, I rebooted the entire machine after changing the configuration.With this setup, I spent about one full work day in a Wayland session. Trying to
actually get some work done uncovers issues that might not show in casual
testing. Most of the day was spent trying to fix Wayland issues 😅. The
following sections explain what I have learned/observed.Many years ago, when Wayland became more popular, people asked on the i3 issue
tracker if i3 would be ported to Wayland. I said no: How could I port a program
to an environment that doesn’t even run on any of my computers? But also, I knew
that with working a full-time job, I wouldn’t have time to be an early adopter
and shape Wayland development.This attitude resulted in Drew DeVault starting the
Sway project around 2016,
which aims to be a Wayland version of i3. I don’t see Sway as
competition. Rather, I thought it was amazing that people liked the i3 project
so much that they would go through the trouble of creating a similar program for
other environments! What a nice compliment! 😊Sway aims to be compatible with i3 configuration files, and it mostly is.If you’re curious, here is what I changed from the Sway defaults, mostly moving
key bindings around for the NEO keyboard layout I
use, and configuring / blocks that I formerly configured in my

file:I encountered the following issues with Sway:I don’t know how I can configure the same libinput settings that I had
before.  See xinput-list-props-mx-ergo.txt
for what I have on X11. Sway’s available  settings do not seem
to match what I used before.The mouse cursor / pointer seems laggy, somehow?! It seems to take longer to
react when I move the trackball, and it also seems to move less smoothly
across the screen.Simon Ser suspects that this might be because
hardware cursor support might not work with the nVidia drivers currently.No Xwayland scaling: programs started via Xwayland are blurry (by default) or
double-scaled (when setting ). This is a Sway-specific
limitation: KDE fixed this in
2022. From
Sway issue #2966, I can tell
that Sway developers do not seem to like this approach for some reason, but
that’s  for my migration: The backwards compatibility
option of running older programs through Xwayland is effectively unavailable
to me.Sometimes, keyboard shortcuts seem to be executed twice! Like, when I focused
the first of five Chrome windows in a stack and moved that window to another
workspace,  would be moved instead of one. I also see messages
like this one (not exactly correlated with the double-shortcut problem,
though):[ERROR] [wlr] [libinput] event0  - https: kinT (kint36): client bug: event
processing lagging behind by 32ms, your system is too slow
When I first started GTK programs like GIMP or Emacs, I noticed all fonts were
way too large! Apparently, I still had some scaling-related settings that I
needed to reset like so:gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor
gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor
Debugging tip: Display GNOME settings using  (stored in
).Some programs like  apparently need an explicit export GDK_BACKEND=wayland environment variable, otherwise they run in
Xwayland. Weird.I also noticed that font rendering is different between X11 and Wayland! The
difference is visible in Chrome browser tab titles and the URL bar, for example:At first I thought that maybe Wayland defaults to different font-antialiasing
and font-hinting settings, but I tried experimenting with the following settings
(which default to font-antialiasing=grayscale and ), but
couldn’t get things to render like they did before:gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-antialiasing 'rgba'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-hinting 'full'
: Thanks to
Hugo for pointing out
that under Wayland, GTK3 ignores the ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
configuration file and uses dconf exclusively! Setting the following dconf
setting makes the font rendering match:gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Cantarell 11'
I quickly ran into a difference in architecture between the two programs:i3lock shows a screen locker window. When you kill i3lock, the screen is
unlocked.When you kill swaylock, you end up in a .To get out of this state, you need to restart swaylock and unlock. You can
unlock from the command line by sending  to the  process.“The compositor must stop rendering and provide input to normal
clients. Instead the compositor must blank all outputs with an opaque color
such that their normal content is fully hidden.”OK, so when you start  via SSH for testing, remember to always unlock
instead of just cancelling  with Ctrl+C. And hope it never crashes.I used to start  via a wrapper script, which turns off the monitor
(input wakes it up):With Wayland, the DPMS behavior has to be implemented differently, with :I use a few small tools that use this interface.I noticed the following issues when using these tools with Sway:On X11, I use the rxvt-unicode
(URxvt) terminal emulator. It has a couple of quality-of-life features that I
don’t want to lose, aside from being fast and coming with a minimal look:Backwards search through your scrollback (= command output)Opening URLs in your scrollback using keyboard shortcutsOpening a new terminal window in the same working directoryUpdating the terminal title from your shellIn earlier experiments, I tried Alacritty or Kitty, but wasn’t happy with
either.I started a  config
file
to match my URxvt config, but later I noticed that at least some colors don’t
seem to match (some text lines with green/red background looked different). I’m
not sure why and have not yet looked into it any further.I noticed the following issues using :Pressing Ctrl+Enter (which I seem to do by mistake quite a bit) results in
escape sequences, whereas URxvt just treats Ctrl+Enter like Enter.This can be worked around in your shell (Zsh, in my case), see foot issue
#628 for details.Double-clicking on part of a URL with the mouse selects the URL (as expected),
but without the  scheme prefix! Annoying when you do want to use the
mouse.I can hold Ctrl to work around this, which will make  select everything
under the pointer up to, and until, the next space characters.Starting 
 in  results in not having
color support for programs running inside the  session. Probably a
terminfo-related problem somehow…? I can also reproduce this issue with GNOME
terminal. But with URxvt or xterm, it
works.Selecting text highlights the text within the line, but not the entire line.
This is different from other terminal emulators I am used to, but I don’t see
an option to change it.Here’s a screenshot showing  after triple-clicking on the right of
“kthreadd”:But triple-clicking on an echo output line highlights only the contents, not
the whole line:I find Emacs’s Wayland support rather disappointing. The standard version of
Emacs only supports X11, so on Sway, it starts in Xwayland. Because Sway does
not support scaling with Xwayland, Emacs shows up blurry (top/background
window):Native Wayland support (bottom/foreground window) is only available in the
 Emacs version ( on NixOS).  used to be a separate
branch, but was merged in Emacs 29 (July 2023). There seem to be issues
with  on X11 (you get a warning when starting Emacs-pgtk on X11), so there
have to be two separate versions for now…Unfortunately, the  text rendering looks different than native X11 text
rendering! The line height and letter spacing seems different:I’m not sure why it’s different! Does anybody know how to make it match the old
behavior?Aside from the different text rendering, the other major issue for me is input
latency: Emacs-pgtk feels significantly slower (less responsive) than
Emacs. This was reported on Reddit multiple times (thread
1,
thread
2)
and Emacs bug #71591, but
there doesn’t seem to be any solution.I’ll also need a solution for running Emacs remotely. Thus far, I use X11
forwarding over SSH (which works fine and with low latency over fiber
connections). I should probably check out waypipe, but have not yet had a
chance.When starting Chrome and checking the  debug page, things look
good:But rather quickly, after moving and resizing browser windows, the GPU process
dies with messages like the following and, for example, WebGL is no longer
hardware accelerated:ERROR:ui/ozone/platform/wayland/gpu/gbm_pixmap_wayland.cc:95] Cannot create bo with format=RGBA_8888 and usage=Scanout|Rendering|Texturing

ERROR:content/browser/gpu/gpu_process_host.cc:1005] GPU process exited unexpectedly: exit_code=8704
Of course, using a browser without hardware acceleration is very frustrating,
especially at high resolutions. Starting Chrome with --disable-gpu-compositing
seems to work around the GPU process exiting, but Chrome still does not feel as
smooth as on X11.Another big issue for me is that Sway does not open Chrome windows on the
workspace on which I closed them. Support for tracking and restoring the
 EWMH atom was added to i3 in January
2016
and to Chrome in May
2016
and Firefox in March
2020.I typically have 5+ workspaces and even more Chrome windows at any given point,
so having to sort through 10+ Chrome windows every day (when I boot my work
computer) is .I work remotely a lot, so screen sharing is a table-stakes feature for me.  I
use screen sharing in my browser almost every day, in different scenarios and
with different requirements.In X11, I am used to the following experience with Chrome. I click the “Window”
tab and see previews of my windows. When I select the window and confirm, its
contents get shared:To get screen sharing to work in Wayland/sway, you need to install
 and  (the latter is specific to
wlroots, which sway uses).With these packages set up, this is the behavior I see:I can share a Chrome tab.I can share the entire monitor.I  share a specific window (the entire monitor shows up as a single
window).I changed my NixOS configuration to use sway and wlroots from git to try it
out. When I click on the “Window” tab, I see a chooser in which I need to select
a window:After selecting the window, I see only that window’s contents previewed in
Chrome:After confirming, I get another chooser and need to select the window
again. Notably, there is no connection between the previewed window and the
chosen window in this second step — if I chose a different window, that’s what
will be shared:Now that window is screenshared (so the feature now works; nice!), but
unfortunately in low resolution, meaning the text is blurry for my co-workers.I reported this as xdg-desktop-portal-wlr issue
#364 and it
seems like the issue is that the wrong scale factor is applied. The patch
provided in the issue works for me.But, on a high level, the whole flow seems wrong: I shouldn’t see a chooser when
clicking on Chrome’s “Window” tab. I should see previews of all windows. I
should be able to select the window in Chrome, not with a separate chooser.I also noticed a very annoying glitch when output scaling is enabled: the
contents of (some!) windows would “jump around” as I was switching between
windows (in a tabbed or stacked container) or between workspaces.I first noticed this in the  terminal emulator, where the behavior is as follows:Switch focus to another  terminal by changing workspaces, or by
switching focus within a stacked or tabbed container.The new  terminal shows up with its text contents slightly offset.Within a few milliseconds, ’s text jumps to the correct position.I captured the following frame with my iPhone just as the content was moving a
few pixels, shortly after switching focus to this window:My guess is that because Sway sets the scale factor to 1 for invisible windows,
when switching focus you see a scale-1 content buffer until the application
provided its scale-3 content buffer.dunst supports Wayland natively. I tried dunst 1.13 and did not notice any
issues.rofi works on Wayland since v2.0.0 (2025-09-01).I use rofi with rofimoji as my Emoji
picker. For text input, instead of ,  seems to work. I didn’t
notice any issues.Instead of my usual choice 
, I tried 
, but unfortunately ’s  flag to select the
window to capture is rather cumbersome to use (and captures in 1x scale).Does anyone have any suggestions for a good alternative?Finally I made some progress on getting a Wayland session to work in my
environment!Before giving my verdict on this Wayland/sway experiment, let me explain that my
experience on X11/i3 is really good. I don’t see any tearing or other artifacts
or glitches in my day-to-day computer usage. I don’t use a compositor, so my
input latency is really good: I once measured it to approximately 763 μs in
Emacs on X11 with my custom-built keyboard (plus output latency), see kinX:
latency measurement (2018).So from my perspective, switching from this existing, flawlessly working stack
(for me) to Sway only brings downsides. I observe new graphical glitches that I
didn’t have before. The programs I spend most time in (Chrome and Emacs) run
noticeably worse. Because of the different implementations, or because I need to
switch programs entirely, I encounter a ton of new bugs.For the first time, an on-par Wayland experience seems within reach, but
realistically it will require weeks or even months of work still. In my
experience, debugging sessions quickly take hours as I need to switch graphics
cards and rewire monitors to narrow down bugs. I don’t have the time to
contribute much to fixing these numerous issues unfortunately, so I’ll keep
using X11/i3 for now.For me, a Wayland/Sway session will be ready as my daily driver when:Sway no longer triggers some key bindings twice some times (“ghost key
presses”)I no longer see glitches when switching between windows or workspaces in Sway.Chrome is continuously hardware-accelerated.Chrome windows are restored to their previous workspace when starting.Emacs either:
Runs via Xwayland and Sway makes scaling work.Or if its  variant fixes its input latency issues
and can be made to render text the same as before somehow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neural Networks: Zero to Hero</title><link>https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html</link><author>suioir</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 4 Jan 2026 05:02:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We implement a bigram character-level language model, which we will further complexify in followup videos into a modern Transformer language model, like GPT. In this video, the focus is on (1) introducing torch.Tensor and its subtleties and use in efficiently evaluating neural networks and (2) the overall framework of language modeling that includes model training, sampling, and the evaluation of a loss (e.g. the negative log likelihood for classification).We implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP) character-level language model. In this video we also introduce many basics of machine learning (e.g. model training, learning rate tuning, hyperparameters, evaluation, train/dev/test splits, under/overfitting, etc.).We dive into some of the internals of MLPs with multiple layers and scrutinize the statistics of the forward pass activations, backward pass gradients, and some of the pitfalls when they are improperly scaled. We also look at the typical diagnostic tools and visualizations you'd want to use to understand the health of your deep network. We learn why training deep neural nets can be fragile and introduce the first modern innovation that made doing so much easier: Batch Normalization. Residual connections and the Adam optimizer remain notable todos for later video.We take the 2-layer MLP (with BatchNorm) from the previous video and backpropagate through it manually without using PyTorch autograd's loss.backward(): through the cross entropy loss, 2nd linear layer, tanh, batchnorm, 1st linear layer, and the embedding table. Along the way, we get a strong intuitive understanding about how gradients flow backwards through the compute graph and on the level of efficient Tensors, not just individual scalars like in micrograd. This helps build competence and intuition around how neural nets are optimized and sets you up to more confidently innovate on and debug modern neural networks.We take the 2-layer MLP from previous video and make it deeper with a tree-like structure, arriving at a convolutional neural network architecture similar to the WaveNet (2016) from DeepMind. In the WaveNet paper, the same hierarchical architecture is implemented more efficiently using causal dilated convolutions (not yet covered). Along the way we get a better sense of torch.nn and what it is and how it works under the hood, and what a typical deep learning development process looks like (a lot of reading of documentation, keeping track of multidimensional tensor shapes, moving between jupyter notebooks and repository code, ...).We build a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT), following the paper "Attention is All You Need" and OpenAI's GPT-2 / GPT-3. We talk about connections to ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm. We watch GitHub Copilot, itself a GPT, help us write a GPT (meta :D!) . I recommend people watch the earlier makemore videos to get comfortable with the autoregressive language modeling framework and basics of tensors and PyTorch nn, which we take for granted in this video.The Tokenizer is a necessary and pervasive component of Large Language Models (LLMs), where it translates between strings and tokens (text chunks). Tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the LLM pipeline: they have their own training sets, training algorithms (Byte Pair Encoding), and after training implement two fundamental functions: encode() from strings to tokens, and decode() back from tokens to strings. In this lecture we build from scratch the Tokenizer used in the GPT series from OpenAI. In the process, we will see that a lot of weird behaviors and problems of LLMs actually trace back to tokenization. We'll go through a number of these issues, discuss why tokenization is at fault, and why someone out there ideally finds a way to delete this stage entirely.

Military modernization races parallel diplomatic thaws to choppy cessation of hostilities, while economic dislocations surface in tech and resource sectors. The global order fractures into multiplex trajectories where strategic alignments co-exist uneasily with enduring contestation.The China-India thaw in 2025 indicated pragmatic recalibration but exposes a fraught tension between border management and persistent territorial dispute, underpinned by nationalist fault lines and geostrategic competition. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia’s localized conflict, exemplified by the Thailand-Cambodia border ceasefire, underscores how deeply historical legacies and nationalist fervour poison bilateral relations despite ASEAN mediation efforts. Myanmar’s controlled election and Vietnam’s reformist continuity highlight divergent political adaptations to regional instability.Ukraine emerges as a crucible of leadership and intelligence evolution, manifest in Zelenskyy’s appointment of a hard-edged military-intelligence chief and intricate peace negotiation signalling amidst ongoing conflict. The United States’ defense and tech posture manifests dual pressures of aging platforms, reform imperatives, and the emerging prominence of autonomous systems like Northrop Grumman’s Talon drone, reflecting a strategic pivot toward innovation amid resource constraints.Economic dislocations reveal themselves in sharply contrasting corporate and financial dynamics. Tesla’s delivery declines and BYD’s ascent illustrate shifting global technology leadership intertwined with supply chain upheavals, subsidy expiration, and consumer sentiment fragility. Tencent’s withholding of IPO details contrasts with biotech volatility around Sellas Life Sciences, revealing investor appetite and fear in innovation-driven sectors. Meanwhile, the US financial markets are awash with retail trading frenzies, skeptical of narratives and prone to emotional pitfalls, where prop trading and algorithmic deployment expose the tension between aspiration and discipline.Domestically, the UK contends with acute political shifts: Reform party’s rejection of Tory overtures exposes an identity crisis amid deteriorating governance perceptions; controversies over immigration policy, legal aid for prisoners, and the European Court of Human Rights fuel heated debates about sovereignty and justice. Public service institutions face workforce attrition, emblematised by OPM initiatives failing amid budget limits and cultural dissonance.At the intersection of environmental and social crisis, climate change manifests in accelerating ecological collapse and uneven social burdens-from coral reef die-back and deforestation in Nicaragua to US droughts and UK heatwaves-intensifying systemic vulnerabilities against a backdrop of scientific resource erosion.In this multiplex crisis environment, systemic fragilities arise not only from overt conflict but from subtle coordination failures, institutional inertia, and information asymmetries. The interplay of global technological competition, regional nationalist assertiveness, and financial market exuberance produces tension points where policy choices, corporate strategies, and public sentiment collide unpredictably.Markets price coordination. Institutions signal fragmentation. Balance sheet leverage masks liquidity fragility.China-India Relations Thaw and 2026 Outlook (T1): Progress amid persistent competition; impact on regional stability.Southeast Asia Border Conflict and Elections (T2): Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire fragility; Myanmar electoral sham.Ukraine Conflict and Intelligence Leadership Shift (T3): Budanov’s appointment; peace negotiation strategic tensions.US Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft Program (T4): Northrop’s Talon drone prototype and innovation strategy.Tesla-BYD Market Dynamics and Electric Vehicle Industry (T5): Contract collapse and shifting EV leadership.UK Federal Workforce Decline and Reform Initiatives (T6): OPM “Make Government Cool” effort versus mass firings.HardBit 4.0 Ransomware Evolution (T7): Operational security and destructive payload risks.Retail Trading Psychology and Prop Firm Challenges (T8): Emotional control as critical success differentiator.DC Fiction Beyond Political Drama (T9): Literary and film captures of authentic urban life.Climate Crisis Manifestations and Ecological Impacts (T10): Heatwaves, deforestation, and glacier retreat feedback loops.UK Political Turmoil and Immigration Policy Paradoxes (T11): Reform and Labour clashes over borders and rights.Tesla and Tech Sector Market Volatility (T12): Delivery misalignments, AI infrastructure hype, and investor sentiment.Federal Employee Benefits, Retirement, and Fiscal Policy Debates (T13): Pension triple lock and stealth tax controversies.UK Social Welfare and Housing Prioritization Controversies (T14): Migrant allocations and public backlash.Biotech Speculation: Sellas Life Sciences and Clinical Trial Ambiguity (T15): Community-driven hype versus data opacity.US Space Sector Rally, IPO Prospects, and Competition (T16): ASTS, RKLB, and SpaceX valuation dynamics.China-India Relations Thaw and 2026 Outlook (T1)The thaw in China-India relations initiated in 2025, catalysed at the 2024 BRICS summit and followed by border disengagements and resumed diplomatic visits, signals cautious pragmatism in an otherwise fraught rivalry. Key operational mechanisms-such as management of disputed border sectors-have stabilised frontline tensions, while limited economic engagements resumed, including eased export controls on strategic technologies like tunnel boring machines and rare earths. Yet, the retention of fundamental territorial disputes, sporadic incidents like the November 2025 detention of an Indian national in China, and India's ongoing strategic alignments with Western partners and its close ties with Taiwan complicate any deep reconciliation.Analysts assess the progress not as a US-driven outcome but the product of Beijing and Delhi’s mutual economic dependence and conflict cost assessment. Nationalism and historical mistrust act as persistent barriers to deeper trust-building, with third-party actors like Pakistan and the US forecast to continue influencing the diplomatic trajectory. Expectations for 2026 suggest incremental, cautious engagement amidst ongoing competition, with diplomatic trust vulnerable to incident-driven setbacks.Southeast Asia Border Conflict and Elections (T2)The December 2025 ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia marks a fragile pause in a conflict dating back over a century and most recently inflamed by multiple military clashes in 2025 that caused significant casualties and displacement. Despite ASEAN-led diplomatic mediation and a freeze on frontlines, deep-seated mistrust and nationalist fervour ensure bilateral relations remain fraught with bitterness. The upcoming Thai parliamentary election frames an effort to stabilise political turbulence, yet structural volatility undergirds domestic politics.Myanmar’s purported multiphase elections, dominated by the military-backed USDP claiming overwhelming success, are widely viewed as a legitimising facade rather than a genuine democratic transition, with ethnic conflicts and resistance consolidated beneath political theatre. Vietnam’s leadership pursues administrative reforms focusing on state administration slimming and policy coherence, reflecting a more technocratic approach to growth amid regional uncertainties.The interweaving of nationalism, military dominance, and reformist continuity depicts Southeast Asia facing heterogeneous political trajectories, each shaped by long historical grievances and immediate strategic calculations.Ukraine Conflict and Intelligence Leadership Shift (T3)Ukraine’s evolving security posture is exemplified by President Zelenskyy’s appointment of Gen. Kyrylo Budanov as chief of staff, elevating wartime military-intelligence operational leadership into the highest executive policymaking echelon. Budanov’s reputation for deep strikes against Russian military infrastructure aligns with Ukraine’s intensifying focus on integrating intelligence capabilities with political-diplomatic engagement. Concurrent Russian missile strikes and cyclical drone attacks sustain a brutal conflict dynamic, while U.S.-led diplomatic efforts negotiate fragile peace proposals, increasingly constrained by escalatory incidents such as the disputed drone attack on Putin’s residence.Ukraine signals near completion of peace accords but warns of unresolved territorial disputes. The U.S. maneuvers to coordinate allies and stabilize talks face growing challenges amid persistent hostilities. The appointment reshapes Ukraine’s command communications, risking higher integration but also concentrated vulnerabilities.US Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft Program (T4)The U.S. Air Force’s designation of Northrop Grumman’s Talon as a YFQ-48A prototype within the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program marks a strategic inflection toward versatile, semi-autonomous wingman drones that enhance manned fighter capabilities affordably and flexibly. The Talon’s redesigned lighter and modular architecture, accelerated development via autonomous testbeds, and international export ambitions underscore a defense sector prioritising innovation amid budgetary and technological pressures.This program signals a shift away from monolithic platforms toward distributed capabilities that can intelligently execute strikes, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare in contested environments. Air Force emphasis on continuous competition among contractors aims to sustain technological edge dividends while controlling costs.Tesla-BYD Market Dynamics and Electric Vehicle Industry (T5)Tesla’s strategic challenges crystallised in the 2025 collapse of its $2.67 billion supply contract with South Korean cathode maker L&F, reflecting a severe contraction linked to Cybertruck production delays, shifting internal sourcing, and the expiration of U.S. EV tax credits. Tesla’s automotive deliveries declined sharply by 16% year-over-year in Q4 2025, with significant loses in crucial European markets to BYD, which overtook Tesla in BEV deliveries amid strong Chinese government support and expanding Southeast Asian demand.Tesla’s narrative increasingly focuses on AI and robotics promises, detaching stock valuation from delivery fundamentals and attracting polarized investor sentiment. BYD’s ascendancy epitomises China’s targeted industrial policy effectively challenging U.S. EV leadership. Market observers await Tesla’s technical resolutions and strategic pivots, weighing sustainability amid intensifying competition.UK Federal Workforce Decline and Reform Initiatives (T6)The UK federal workforce contraction, estimated at around 9% in recent periods, reflects cumulative effects of Deferred Retirement Program incentives, hiring freezes, and mass probationary terminations. OPM Director Scott Kupor’s “Make Government Cool Again” initiative, promising a tech-focused “U.S. Tech Force” to inject youthful engineers for short-term modernization baffles a demoralised and ageing civil service facing pay stagnation, telework retrenchment, and benefit erosion.Internal skepticism surrounds the proposal’s effectiveness amid systemic bureaucratic inertia and political constraints. Workforce morale and trust suffer under perceptions of hollow PR masking deep cuts, while short-term hires risk accelerating brain drain. The federal sector grapples with reconciling modernization needs with fiscal discipline and employee retention.HardBit 4.0 Ransomware Evolution (T7)The HardBit ransomware family’s fourth iteration exhibits elevated operational security with mandatory operator-supplied runtime authorization, blurring forensic attribution. Its dual interface models, leveraging legacy infection deployment alongside contemporary hands-on-keys techniques, and an optional destructive wiper mode, represent hybrid malware design converging extortion and sabotage.Lateral movement enabled through stolen credentials and disablement of recovery vectors reflects targeting of high-value networks for durable control. The absence of data leak websites limits external visibility into victimology, complicating response efforts. This evolution spotlights the intensifying sophistication and malice of ransomware operations.Retail Trading Psychology and Prop Firm Challenges (T8)Retail traders transitioning from paper to live funded accounts confront intensified emotional volatility, manifest in overtrading, fear-of-missing-out, and breakdowns in strict exit discipline. Community consensus underscores psychological mastery and process adherence as decisive factors exceeding raw strategy refinement. Journaling, rule automation, and small position sizing emerge as practical tools to counter impulsiveness.Prop firms' opaque business models amplify trader frustration, with high failure rates and constraints skewed toward firm profitability. Aggressive daily payout targets and risk control regimes challenge trader consistency, fostering burnout and attrition. Emotional reprogramming, not suppression, is critical for sustainable trading success.DC Fiction Beyond Political Drama (T9)Washington DC’s cultural narratives extend beyond political machinations into richly textured urban and social milieus. Authors like George Pelecanos depict blue-collar neighborhoods with detective stories rooted in tangible experiences rather than elite spheres. Films like  celebrate everyday hustling amid bureaucratic absurdity, blending humor with social empathy.Historical fiction, occult urban fantasy, and contemporary thrillers capture varied subcultures and socio-economic realities often overlooked in politicised portrayals. This literary and cinematic diversity fulfills a desire for authentic representation of DC’s complex identity.Climate Crisis Manifestations and Ecological Impacts (T10)Record-breaking heatwaves, accelerated deforestation in Nicaragua’s Bosawas Reserve, melting glaciers triggering volcanic risks, and acute drought-induced agricultural devastation in regions like Jordan mark an escalation of climate-induced polycrisis globally. Ecological degradation proceeds amid inadequate scientific capacity as critical research institutions face closure.Urban areas and vulnerable populations bear disproportionate suffering from intensifying climate extremes, reflecting systemic inequality embedded in infrastructure and policy gaps. Adaptation efforts remain nascent and incomplete, exposing fragile overlays of human and natural systems to cascading failure.UK Political Turmoil and Immigration Policy Paradoxes (T11)UK’s political landscape is convulsed by conflicting pressures: Reform Party’s rejection of Tory merger overtures amid identity and purity anxieties; Labour’s criticized immigration enforcement failed to stem record Channel crossings; Human Rights court decisions granting compensation to violent offenders inciting public outrage; and debates over EU legal constraints versus national sovereignty.Public discourse is steeped in nationalism, polarisation, and deep distrust toward establishment parties, complicated by legal and humanitarian obligations. The reciprocal hostility between UK and France over migrant crossings exemplifies escalating diplomatic and domestic tensions.Tesla and Tech Sector Market Volatility (T12)Despite fundamental delivery declines and waning subsidies, Tesla’s stock defies logic through speculative narratives focused on AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robotics. Market valuation disconnects amplify volatility as investors wrestle between cult-like enthusiasm and fundamental skepticism. BYD’s systematic rise accentuates Tesla’s competitive vulnerabilities.Tech sector incumbents face AI-driven disruption; SaaS companies endure growth slowdowns amid pressure to integrate AI or risk obsolescence. Investors navigate shifting valuations, market rotations, and the challenges of differentiating transient corrections from structural changes.Federal Employee Benefits, Retirement, and Fiscal Policy Debates (T13)The UK’s pension triple lock becomes a flashpoint amid fiscal sustainability debates, facing bipartisan pressure due to demographic aging and funding burdens. Labour’s stealth taxes disproportionately affect working earners relative to pensioners, fueling resentment and political skepticism.DC’s public workforce grapples with slow vesting, modest contributions, and competing private sector opportunities affecting recruitment and retention. Federal pay hikes stagnate, telework options shrink, and morale deteriorates against a backdrop of workforce downsizing and leadership messaging misalignments.UK Social Welfare and Housing Prioritization Controversies (T14)Controversial allocation of scarce new-build social housing prioritizes migrants and asylum seekers, provoking widespread public fury amid growing homelessness and perceived displacement of native residents. Political discourse weaponizes allocation policies, fueling xenophobic mobilization benefiting nationalist factions.Council policies reportedly implement diversity criteria lacking transparency, exacerbating social anxiety. Opposing narratives depict migrants either as unjust beneficiaries or as crucial contributors. The accommodation cost trade-offs prompt debate on long-term sustainability and social cohesion.Biotech Speculation: Sellas Life Sciences and Clinical Trial Ambiguity (T15)Sellas Life Sciences’ stock rally exemplifies biotech’s speculative extremes: enthusiasm around a novel AML immunotherapy clashes with opaque trial data, CEO communication ambiguity, and imminent cash burn risks. Community-driven hype fuels volatile trading, conflating trial delays with positive signals amid diverging interpretations of statistical survival data.The mounting need for capital raises threatens dilution; regulatory shifts in drug pricing may constrain upside. The dichotomy between hopeful transformational therapy potential and harsh market skepticism underscores biotech’s investor psychology challenges.US Space Sector Rally, IPO Prospects, and Competition (T16)Space sector equities surged early 2026 amid anticipation of a SpaceX IPO targeting $1.5 trillion valuation. AST SpaceMobile and Rocket Lab benefited from operational milestones and investor fervor, yet concerns about Starlink’s potential market dominance and competitive coherence linger.Emerging markets for direct-to-device satellite broadband and responsive small launch vehicles highlight a fragmented but expanding landscape. The confluence of regulatory scrutiny, technological innovation, and market speculation shape sector trajectories amid great power space competition.Narratives and Fault LinesThe clearest narrative fissure lies between technological optimism and pragmatic realism, seen from Tesla’s investors caught between cultish hype and delivery setbacks, to biotech speculators balancing hope against data shadows in Sellas Life Sciences. This mirrors the broader divide in AI and automation discourse, where transformational aspirations contend with bubble warnings, emphasizing the tension between momentum investing and fundamental valuation discipline.On geopolitical fronts, observers diverge on the nature of China-India détente: optimists view it as path-breaking pragmatic diplomacy rooted in economic rationality, while sceptics see superficial stability masking an enduring strategic rivalry and nationalist edge. Similarly, in Southeast Asia, ASEAN-led peace efforts are hailed as progress by multilateralists but dismissed as fragile by regional nationalists who anticipate recurrence of conflict.In UK politics, Reform supporters reject compromise with traditional parties, insisting on ideological purity to restore national sovereignty, while pragmatic councillors and officials weigh tactical cooperation. Immigration policy debates split public opinion sharply between humanitarian concern and perceived national security threats, reinforcing political polarization that stifles constructive policy formation.Finance communities showcase interpretive divides between the risk-tolerant retail day traders striving for algorithmic mastery and the cautious investors advocating strict risk controls and process discipline. The psychological gulf between novices facing emotional breakdowns and veterans championing mentorship and journaling enlightenment exemplifies the human cost embedded in market participation.Hidden Risks and Early WarningsThe Russian banking sector’s loan quality masking and continued liquidity injections, juxtaposed with Central Bank reluctance to ease interest rates, portend a latent banking crisis with inflationary pressures. The opacity surrounding non-performing loans and restructured exposures leaves systemic fragility concealed, risking sudden market upheaval.US military aging platforms and diminished production capabilities-especially the 45% cut in F-35 procurement-expose a narrowing technological lead as Chinese naval expansion outpaces growth. Vulnerabilities around strategic reconnaissance satellites, such as Russia’s missile early-warning constellation breakdown, compound strategic uncertainty and raise escalation risks from miscalculations.In cybersecurity, HardBit 4.0 ransomware’s enhanced obfuscation and destructive capabilities signal an escalation in attacker operational security and weaponised malware, challenging incident response effectiveness. Simultaneously, retail trading's psychological strain and failures in risk management reveal systemic vulnerabilities where emotional lapses can precipitate rapid financial harm, exacerbated by prop firm business models designed for profitability at traders’ expense.The accelerating environmental crises outlined-from deforestation spikes to glacier retreat triggering volcanic activity-highlight ecological feedback loops with little institutional capacity for monitoring or adaptation, raising risks of nonlinear tipping points with severe socio-economic consequences.Possible Escalation PathsTactical border flare-ups between Thailand and Cambodia could reignite into broader conflict, undermining ASEAN’s fragile mediation and destabilizing regional economic integration, especially if nationalist pressures intensify during 2026 elections.Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations may collapse following escalatory provocations, including drone strikes and retaliatory Russian missile attacks, provoking expanded hostilities or complicating Western aid, with the newly appointed intelligence chief's leadership pivotal to conflict trajectory.US-Chinese strategic competition could spur accelerated missile production coupled with cyber and space contestation, amplifying risks of inadvertent crisis, as Russia’s degradation in strategic satellite capabilities leaves gaps exploitable by adversaries.Tesla’s production challenges coupled with aggressive Chinese EV industrial policy may trigger global market share realignments, pressuring US supply chains and investor confidence, inciting further volatility in technology equity valuations.UK domestic political fractures over immigration and legal controls risk unleashing civil unrest, especially if Reform party hardline tactics gain mass resonance amid perceived governance failures, fracturing social cohesion further.Ransomware evolution with destructive payloads could initiate targeted critical infrastructure sabotage, advancing from financial extortion to strategic disruption, particularly if attribution precision remains elusive and public-private defense coordination lags.Unanswered Questions To WatchHow durable will the China-India borderThis briefing is published live on the Newsdesk hub at  on the lab host.Browse all published Newsdesk briefings; each row links to a full edition snapshot.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ShinyHunters claims Resecurity hack, firm says it’s a honeypot</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-claims-resecurity-hack-firm-says-its-a-honeypot/</link><author>Lawrence Abrams</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 3 Jan 2026 20:34:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ShinyHunters hacking group claims it breached the systems of cybersecurity firm Resecurity and stole internal data, while Resecurity says the attackers only accessed a deliberately deployed honeypot containing fake information used to monitor their activity.

But there are tons of AI bloggers, and Simon is the only one who’s popular on HN, so what sets Simon apart?First, Simon isn’t selling you anything. Simon writes about LLMs as a power user not as a sales pitch from some startup’s VP of product. He tries every AI tool he can get his hands on with no allegiance to any particular vendor. That allows him to write about how new AI tools fit into the ecosystem at large. It’s like getting restaurant recommendations from someone who eats out 20 times a week as opposed to someone who owns 20 restaurant chains.Simon is also one of the most prolific bloggers on Hacker News. In 2025 alone, he wrote over 1,000 blog posts, though only 118 were full-length articles (“only”).Simon has said these types of posts are easy to write yet high in value.The #2 spot was an extremely tight race this year. Jeff’s posts totaled 10,813 upvotes, edging out the #3 blogger by just 9 points (a 0.08% difference). The #4 finisher was just 100 points behind that. Past stories can still accrue upvotes, so this could still flip, but these were the rankings as of midnight on Dec. 31st.Jeff is a popular YouTube creator with over 1M subscribers. He covers some of HN’s favorite topics, like Raspberry Pi computers, self-hosted software, and computer hardware. YouTube videos rarely succeed on Hacker News, so when Jeff publishes a new video, he often publishes an accompanying blog post. Jeff isn’t the only YouTuber who does this, but he’s one of the few who does it .I’ve seen other YouTube creators try to repurpose their videos by auto-generating a transcript and calling that a blog post. Jeff approaches his blog more thoughtfully.Jeff started out as a blogger, and he still treats his blog readers as first-class citizens. He structures his articles to fit the text medium rather than just lazily scraping dialog from his videos. If you read his post about upgrading storage on his Mac mini, it stands on its own and never feels like material he salvaged from a video.After his first success on HN, Sean went from publishing every few months to multiple times per week, becoming a regular fixture on the front page.Sean is a Staff Software Engineer at GitHub and previously worked at Zendesk. Like Simon, Sean is extremely prolific. He wrote 140 posts this year. Of those, 47 reached the front page. I’ve had a few years where a lot of my posts reached the front page, but for me that was about 10 articles. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have a new article on HN almost every week.the recipe for a popular post is to have a clear opinion about working in tech that many people disagree with.I think Sean’s insight is true, but he’s selling his own writing a bit short. To me, Sean’s greatest strength is his ability to explain big tech organizational politics to engineers.Most junior to mid-level developers don’t care about company politics. They think of office politics as something that strong technical thinkers shouldn’t have to waste brain cells on. As a result, they can’t understand why they can’t get promoted or how their company’s codebase got so bad. Sean’s posts explain these phenomena in a way that’s clear and intelligible to engineers.Sean’s posts are also a good example of how much luck comes into play on Hacker News, especially for less established authors. Sean’s top three posts of the year all flopped on their first submission and didn’t succeed until their second or third try, sometimes months later. Even then, only a third of his posts reached the front page at all.Brian Krebs is an independent investigative journalist who covers cybercrime. He’s one of HN’s most popular bloggers of all time, second only to Paul Graham, the creator of HN. For 11 of the last 12 years, Brian has been one of HN’s top 10 bloggers.In 2025, Brian mostly stuck to his usual beat of deeply investigated cybersecurity stories, but his second most popular story of the year was a sobering post about the Trump administration’s steps to undermine free speech in the US. It immediately shot to the #1 slot and stayed there for several hours. Unfortunately, too many users flagged the post, and it was moderated off the front page, which is often the fate of political stories on HN.Neal’s work isn’t what you might think of as blog posts; they’re more like interactive art. Some of his posts are games that parody the web, while others are straight-faced visual essays about topics he finds interesting.This was Neal’s most successful year on HN. Everything he published reached the front page, with about half hitting #1, and the rest peaking at #2. Stimulation Clicker was the 4th most popular post of the entire year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RondoDox Botnet is Using React2Shell to Hijack Thousands of Unpatched Devices</title><link>https://hackread.com/rondodox-botnet-react2shell-hijack-unpatched-devices/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 3 Jan 2026 14:59:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

In a social media post, she said they would “soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts”.It was not immediately clear what the legal and constitutional authority was for the military operation and the capture and trial of a sovereign head of state. Nor was it clear whether Trump consulted Congress beforehand; it is supposed to be notified by the presidency before any declaration of war.Writing on social media, Trump confirmed US troops had launched “a large-scale strike against Venezuela” and said more details would be announced at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. CBS News reported US officials as saying that Maduro had been captured by members of the elite army unit Delta Force, which was responsible for the 2019 killing of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.The bombardment of Venezuela by the US and its kidnapping of a foreign head of state shocked the international community, which reacted with alarm. Neighbouring Colombia condemned the attack, called for an immediate emergency session of the UN security council, and said it was preparing to receive a “massive influx of refugees”.The UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Saul, said Trump should be investigated for the operation.“I condemn the US’s illegal aggression against Venezuela and the illegal abduction of its leader and his wife. Every Venezuelan life lost is a violation of the right to life,” Saul said.Speaking on ​Venezuela’s state-run television channel, the vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, ​appeared to confirm ​the capture of Maduro and Flores​, admitting that she did not know where they were. Rodríguez​, who is one of Maduro’s closest allies, demand​ed immediate “proof of life” ​for the couple and accused the US of “murdering humble and innocent Venezuelan men and women”.“At this moment Venezuela is calm, absorbing the significance of a military aggression of this nature,” she added in the brief telephone interview.It remains unclear who is in charge of Venezuela in the president’s absence. The interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, appeared in a video on state TV flanked by police officers assuring citizens the situation was stable.“The military forces, the police forces … and the people are prepared for any situation, and prepared for any attempt to go further than the cowardly attacks that were carried out against the military forces and our people,” Cabello said, wearing a bulletproof vest and tactical helmet.Earlier, Venezuela’s government accused the US of launching a series of attacks against civilian and military targets in the country after explosions rocked its capital before dawn on Saturday.In a statement, Venezuela’s government urged citizens to rise up against the assault and said Washington risked plunging Latin America into chaos with “an extremely serious” act of “military aggression”.“The entire country must mobilise to defeat this imperialist aggression,” it added.Crowds of Maduro supporters gathered in downtown Caracas, some carrying pictures of the captured president, others embracing tearfully.In a defiant online video, V​enezuela’s defense minister, Gen Vladimir Padrino López​, accused the US of launching a “deplorable” and “criminal” regime change operation and said the “barbaric” invading forces had “desecrated our sacred land”.​“This invasion represents the greatest outrage the country has ever suffere​d,” Padrino López declared, adding that Venezuelan authorities were still trying to calculate how many civilians had been killed or injured during helicopter attacks on urban areas.He called on citizens and soldiers to unite in resistance. “They have attacked us but they will not vanquish us … we will form an indestructible wall of resistance. Our vocation is peace, but our heritage is the fight for freedo​m,” he said.In its statement, Venezuela’s government confirmed three other states had come under attack: Miranda, La Guaira and Aragua.“The only objective of this attack is to seize control of Venezuela’s strategic resources, in particular its oil and minerals,” it said, calling on the international community to denounce what it called a flagrant violation of international law that put millions of lives at risk.At least seven explosions were heard at about 2am and people in various neighbourhoods rushed to the street, the Associated Press reported. “The whole ground shook. This is horrible. We heard explosions and planes in the distance,” said Carmen Hidalgo, a 21-year-old office worker.Witnesses reported seeing smoke pouring from two key military installations in Caracas: La Carlota military airfield in the heart of the city and the Fuerte Tiuna military base where Maduro has long been thought to live. Another important airport to the east of Caracas, Higuerote, also appeared to come under attack.The US has run a five-month pressure campaign against Maduro, which many analysts believe has been aimed at toppling thepresident. Since August, Trump has ordered a massive military buildup off Venezuela’s northern coast and conducted a series of deadly airstrikes on supposed “narco boats”.Trump has repeatedly threatened to launch land operations in Venezuela, amid other efforts to pressure Maduro to leave office, including expanded sanctions, an increased US military presence in the region and more than two dozen strikes on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.Legal experts have said that some of the US strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels could amount to war crimes. At least 110 people have been killed by the strikes so far.The US has also seized sanctioned oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, and Trump ordered a blockade of others in a move that seemed designed to put a tighter chokehold on the country’s economy.Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, published what he claimed was a partial list of the bombed installations in Venezuela, including the 19th-century national assembly building in Caracas; La Carlota, the most important airbase within the capital; and an air force base in the city of Barquisimeto.Other reputedly targeted sites included the Cuartel de la Montaña barracks in Caracas, a military base that is home to the mausoleum of Maduro’s mentor, Hugo Chávez. The mausoleum is one of the most sacred locations for their political movement, Chavismo, which has governed Venezuela in an increasingly authoritarian fashion since Chávez first came to power in 1999. Chávez’s remains were taken to the barracks and put on public display after he died of cancer in 2013.The president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel, denounced the US’s “criminal attack” and said the region was being “brutally assaulted”. “[This is] state terrorism against the gallant people of Venezuela and against Our America,” wrote Díaz-Canel who is Maduro’s main regional ally.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump says Venezuela’s Maduro captured after strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/loud-noises-heard-venezuela-capital-southern-area-without-electricity-2026-01-03/</link><author>jumpocelot</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 3 Jan 2026 06:35:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IQuest-Coder: A new open-source code model beats Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT 5.1 [pdf]</title><link>https://github.com/IQuestLab/IQuest-Coder-V1/blob/main/papers/IQuest_Coder_Technical_Report.pdf</link><author>shenli3514</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 3 Jan 2026 04:01:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-64124 - Nuvation Energy Multi-Stack Controller OS Command Injection</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64124</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Sat, 3 Jan 2026 00:28:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-64124

            The meme will no longer be a dream.TL;DR: 2026 is going to be The Year of The Linux Desktop for me. I haven't booted into Windows in over 3 months on my tower and I'm starting to realize that it's not worth wasting the space for. I plan to unify my three SSDs and turn them all into btrfs drives on Fedora.I've been merely tolerating Windows 11 for a while but recently it's gotten to the point where it's just absolutely intolerable. Somehow Linux on the desktop has gotten so much better by not even doing anything differently. Microsoft has managed to actively sabotage the desktop experience through years of active disregard and spite against their users. They've managed to take some of their most revolutionary technological innovations (the NT kernel's hybrid design allowing it to restart drivers, NTFS, ReFS, WSL, Hyper-V, etc.) then just shat all over them with start menus made with React Native, control-alt-delete menus that are actually just webviews, and forcing Copilot down everyone's throats to the point that I've accidentally gotten stuck in Copilot in a handheld gaming PC and had to hard reboot the device to get out of it. It's as if the internal teams at Microsoft have had decades of lead time in shooting each other in the head with predictable results.To be honest, I've had enough. I'm going to go with Fedora on my tower and Bazzite (or SteamOS) on my handhelds.I think that Linux on the desktop is ready for the masses now, not because it's advanced in a huge leap/bound. It's ready for the masses to use because Windows has gotten so much actively worse that continuing to use it is an active detriment to user experience and stability. Not to mention with the price of ram lately, you need every gigabyte you can get and desktop Linux lets you waste less of it on superfluous bullshit that very few people actually want.At the very least, when something goes wrong on Linux you have log messages that can let you know what went wrong so you can search for it.Facts and circumstances may have changed since publication.

is not all that well known exactly how the Linux kernel security process works.
I gave a
talk about this back in 2023
and at other conferences since then, attempting to explain how it works, but I
also thought it would be good to explain this all in writing as it is required
to know this when trying to understand how the Linux kernel CNA issues CVEs.This is a post in the series about the Linux kernel CVE release process:Linux kernel security work (this post),
how the Linux kernel security team works to fix reported security bugs.Summary up front for those not wanting to read a wall of text:The Linux kernel security team
work to fix reported issues as quickly as possible and get the fixes merged
to public trees, and do not do any announcements anywhere.The Linux kernel security team and the
CVE team
are different groups of people, all of whom do this work on their own
recognition, not associated with any company.Only send plain text emails to the kernel security team.Do not email the kernel security team and expect to get a CVE assigned.As can be seen in the in-kernel documentation
to contact the security team, just email the address in that document the
potential issue that you have found, without using HTML or any binary
attachments, and the developers there will take the report and usually ask
questions and work to resolve the issue if it turns out to actually be a real
security issue.  Many issues reported are not, and so the reporter is told to
send their bug report to the respective mailing list and work on it with the
developers there, in public.When reporting a bug, just send a simple, plain text email to the security
alias.  Do not send an email that contains a binary attachment as opening
unsolicited binary files is not anything anyone should be doing.  Also do not
use markdown formatting, just plain text.  Also, no encryption is needed, as it
will not work due to the email alias handling (i.e. one address to many
individuals.)  If you are forced to use encryption to report security problems,
please reconsider this policy as it feels counterproductive (UK government,
this means you…)The members of the security team contain a handful of core kernel developers
that have experience dealing with security bugs, and represent different major
subsystems of the kernel.  They do this work as individuals, and specifically
can NOT tell their employer, or anyone else, anything that is discussed on the
security alias before it is resolved.  This arrangement has allowed the kernel
security team to remain independent and continue to operate across the
different governments that the members operate in, and it looks to become the
normal way project security teams work with the advent of the European Union’s
new CRA law coming into affect which places requirements on response time of
companies that receive notice of potential security issues in their projects.The way the security team works is when a bug is reported, if the members do
not have experience in that specific subsystem, they drag the maintainers of
that subsystem into the email chain, and work to get the bug resolved.  If a
subsystem has a continued number of bugs reported over time, the maintainer can
be “asked” if they wish to join the alias to help remove the additional “hop”
of bug triage happening.  This is what has caused the alias members to
naturally grow over time to end up representing the major portions of the
kernel with the most issues.Ideally the bug reporter also provides a working fix for the issue, allowing
them to get the proper credit for the fix but of course that does not always
happen.  If no fix is provided, the developers involve work to resolve the bug
as soon as they can, and when they agree it is resolved, get it merged into the
main kernel branch and the stable kernel releases as soon as possible.As the documentation states, no embargoes longer than 7 days are allowed, once
a working fix is made, as there’s no real reason to hold off on getting a fix
merged at that time.  Only very few changes ever have any embargo at all, as
it’s more bother than it is worth.Once the bug is fixed in the kernel trees, the developer’s work is finished,
and it is up to the reporter if they wish to “announce” a bugfix or not.  The
kernel security team on their own do not do any reporting or external
communication at all.  Only later, if the fix is warranted to justify a CVE
being assigned, is the commit announced as a security fix, but that work is
done by the kernel CVE team, NOT the kernel security team.More about how the kernel CVE team works in a later post in this series…This “do not announce anything” policy has been present in the kernel security
team since the very beginning, and as you can imagine, has caused much
“disagreement” by those outside of the kernel community.  This came up soon
after the kernel security team was established in a
2008 email thread with Linus:  On Wed, 16 Jul 2008, pageexec@freemail.hu wrote:

  Umm. What part of "they are just normal bugs" did you have issues with?
  I expressly told you that security bugs should not be marked as such,
  because bugs are bugs.

  No.

  You have two cases:

  - people think the marking is somehow trustworthy.

    People are WRONG, and are misled by the partial markings, thinking that
    unmarked bugfixes are "less important". They aren't.

  - People don't think it matters

    People are right, and the marking is pointless.
    In either case it's just stupid to mark them. I don't want to do it,
    because I don't want to perpetuate the myth of "security fixes" as a
    separate thing from "plain regular bug fixes".

    They're all fixes. They're all important. As are new features, for that
    matter.

  > when you know that you're about to commit a patch that fixes a security
  > bug, why is it wrong to say so in the commit?

  It's pointless and wrong because it makes people think that other bugs
  aren't potential security fixes.

  What was unclear about that?

  Linus
No one knows how you use open sourceThe primary reason why the kernel does not do any security announcements is
that almost any bugfix at the level of an operating system kernel can be a
“security issue” given the issues involved (memory leaks, denial of service,
information leaks, etc.)  Also, given that Linux is open source, the developers
involved in fixing problems do NOT know how Linux is being used.  A simple
bugfix for a minor thing for one user could be a major system vulnerability fix
for a different user, all depending on how Linux is being used.
Ben Hawkes
said it best in a wonderful essay about
“What is a good Linux kernel bug”:“It’s hard to capture the fact that a bug can be
super serious in one type of deployment, somewhat
important in another, or no big deal at all – and that
the bug can be all of this at the same time.
Vulnerability remediation is hard.”
– Ben HawkesAlways remember, kernel developers:do not know your use case.do not know what code you use.do not want to know any of this.So, overall, the kernel security bug policy can be boiled down to:Fix known bugs as soon as possible.Get releases out to users as quickly as possible.For those that are always worried “what if a bugfix causes problems”, they
should remember that a fix for a known bug is better than the potential of a
fix causing a future problem as future problems, when found, will be fixed
then.  You never want to have “known bugfixes” not resolved on your system at
any time.  So much so that recent laws will soon be preventing you that being
allowed for many countries.As history has shown us with
Spectre
and
Meltdown,
this “no embargo” policy does not always work well when working with problems
that cross operating systems and hardware platforms, possibly requiring
firmware or microcode updates.  Because of this, the kernel developers have
been forced to come up with a
“Hardware Security policy”
to handle these types of issues.This different workflow involves the creation of a special encrypted and
restricted email list containing just the needed kernel and hardware developers
that are required to get the problem solved.  With this process, embargoes are
grumpily tolerated for now.  Many different hardware bugs have been resolved in
Linux over the years through this process, but as a participant in some of
these efforts, it is clunky, awkward, and often times extremely slow.  The
kernel developers involved really do not like this process, and hopefully this
will be phased out over time as many hardware issues have been resolved in the
past year without having to get this special process involved at all.Also, due to the CRA timelines, long embargo times will probably not even be
possible for hardware companies to handle.  How that is going to interact with
microcode and firmware updates in the next few years is going to be an
“interesting” thing to watch evolve.Way back in 2005, there was not any “official” way to contact anyone about
kernel security bugs.  It was just an ad-hock group of people that developers
“knew” they could email problems to.  That obviously did not really scale, and
was not helpful for anyone who did not know how the kernel developers worked.
This came to a head in 2005 with
this email from Steve Bergman:From: Steve Bergman <steve@rueb.com>

Subject: Proper procedure for reporting possible security vulnerabilities?
Date: Mon, 10 Jan 2005 10:46:57 -0600

There seems to be some confusion in certain quarters as to the proper
procedure for reporting possible kernel security issues.

REPORTING-BUGS says send bug reports to the maintainer of that area of
the kernel. However, what about areas for which a maintainer is not
listed? (e.g. VM) It seems that some take that to mean send it
directly to Linus and if you don't hear something back quickly, release
an exploit to the wild.

So what is the preferred procedure and is it documented somewhere?
Should it be made more prominent?

Thanks for any information,
Steve Bergman
That naturally kicked off a bit of discussion, so 36 emails later, the idea of
a central email alias that could handle reported security issues was decided on
and a few months later, was

As stated earlier, the kernel security team does not do any sort of
announcements at all, or any public statements anywhere.  They are also not
responsible for assigning CVE ids to any kernel bugfixes, that is a different
team’s responsibility that happens after kernel bugfixes are in public kernel
releases, and almost never before.Because they do not do any announcements, there is also no “early announcement”
list, despite many companies constantly asking to “join the security
pre-announcement security list” requests we get.The primary reason there is no pre-announcement list is overall they should
always be considered public and contain leaks.  Otherwise, why would your
government allow them to exist?  Unless the list is for a project that is not
really used by anyone…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daft Punk Easter Egg in the BPM Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?</title><link>https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/</link><author>simonw</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 21:27:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” generally sits around 123 BPM (Beats Per Minute), though some analyses find it slightly higher (like 123.48 BPM) or list different BPMs in remixes/workouts, with exact figures varying slightly by source and version.Spotify’s metadata database, SongBPM, and most other online BPM databases list it at exactly 123.But I think our helmet-clad robot friends might have been making a little joke that we’ve apparently all missed. The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is actually 123.45.How do I know this? It so happens that for over 10 years I’ve written an app called Tempi that shows the BPM of music in real time, so I know a little bit about the science and algorithms behind music tempo detection.Most tempo detection software works basically the same way:A specialized algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) collects overlapping energy levels at different frequency bands.Those levels are refined into well-defined peaks that represent rhythmic events in the track.Another algorithm (autocorrelation) looks for patterns, or more accurately , in those peaks.But these patterns are tricky because there’s all kinds of noise, performance inaccuracies, and rhythmic harmonics throwing things off. All that is to say, a) it’s complicated and b) it’s not perfectly accurate.When I make changes to my own system of course I need some way to know if it’s getting better or worse, so I have a test library of hundreds of song snippets that I score it against. One of these songs is Daft Punk’s HBFS, and early on I noticed something strange about that track.Almost all electronic music is synced to a sequencer and so obviously is going to have a very steady tempo. But while the vast majority of electronic music tracks I test have an “integral” tempo – meaning their tempo is exactly some round number like 95, and not a fraction like 95.2 – my software always finds the BPM of HBFS to be somewhere between 123 and 124, but not exactly either. For years I’ve chalked this up to inconsistencies with my system and didn’t think much of it. But lately I’ve made improvements to the system so that it’s much more accurate and it now tells me the BPM of HBFS is 123.4.And that got me thinking, “Hmm. Did these guys pick that tempo because they have a sense of humor? And if so, how far would they take it?”To get to the bottom of this I needed to establish what the BPM of HBFS really is.And that’s actually pretty easy to do…Here’s a Venn diagram showing the overlap between human and computer capabilities in the digital realm:Computers can do almost all “computer-y” things (i.e. things that can be entirely done on a computer) MUCH better, faster, (and stronger?) than humans. But for the time being there remain a few things that humans can do very easily which computers find difficult. Along with counting traffic lights and crosswalks, one of those things is finding the exact BPM of a song. Not an estimate like most software does, but the  value with extreme precision across the entire song. Anyone with a basic sense of rhythm and an audio app can do this.Open the song in an audio app like Logic, Audition, Ableton, Reaper, ProTools, etc.Zoom in on the waveform a little bit so you can see the shape of the beats.Find the first obvious beat – meaning it has a well-defined waveform peak – and the last obvious beat. Let’s call these “bookend” beats.Measure the exact duration in seconds between the bookend beats.Play the song and  all the beats starting at the first bookend beat and ending at the last bookend beat. (If you have an old school calculator, an easy way to do this is type “1+1=” and then just keep tapping “=” to add 1 on each beat.)Then to get the  tempo of the track, averaged throughout the entire thing, use this formula:bpm = 60 * (number_of_beats - 1) / durationComputers have a rough time of this because they don’t really know how to “keep a beat”, and the algorithms that  find the beat do a lot better when they already know the estimated BPM, which is obviously a chicken/egg problem.For the first bookend beat in HBFS I used the first beat after the “whooshing” intro, at around 5.58s. The last bookend beat I used the last “work” at about the 3:41.85 mark. (“Never” and “Over” aren’t good candidates because you can’t see their waveform peaks.)That gives exactly 446 beats or 445 intervals.I tried this with two different copies of HBFS. The Discovery CD rip I have of the song has a duration between the bookend beats of 216.282, so:bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.282 = 123.4499403556The “YouTube official audio” track I tested has a duration of 216.276, so:bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.276 = 123.4533651445The original Discovery CD version has obviously undergone less processing over time than the YouTube version so I tend to think it’s more representative, and it’s  close to 123.45 – only a 0.00005964 difference! But even the more modern YouTube version closely rounds to 123.45.So hopefully I’ve put this fact to rest:The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is 123.45.But…was this intentional, or just a happy accident?The year is 1999 or 2000. Would the gear Daft Punk uses even  fractional BPMs? And if so out to how many decimal places?From their 2001 interview with Remix Magazine (archive.org) we know that Bangalter says:Our sequencing is done either on an E-mu SP-1200, an Akai MPC, or a PC with Logic Audio software. We do not work on things in just one way.And from later interviews we know the Akai MPC was specifically an MPC-3000. (Oh, and that’s ’s Logic,  Apple’s. Apple didn’t acquire Emagic until 2002.)Did the E-mu support fractional BPMs? Yes, but only to 1 decimal place:The Akai MPC-3000? Yep, also to 1 decimal place:What about Emagic’s Logic?Oooh, look at that. Logic supported BPMs to  decimal places.But while we know those three sequencers were used on the Discovery album, I’m not sure anyone else knows which one was specifically used on HBFS. I’ve searched and searched and it seems this detail has just never been revealed.So we’ve never actually made music with computers! [laughs] Neither Homework nor Discovery nor even Human After All were made with computers.Was he contradicting himself from 12 years before? Or did he forget? Or maybe it’s a terminology thing?That the CD version is  close to exactly 123.45 makes me think this was intentional. And if it was? Well played, robots. You managed to leave a little Easter egg hiding in plain sight for 25 years.Update: A Hacker News reader pointed out that I accidentally reversed the durations of the YouTube clip and the CD rip. Fixed!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2026-21448 - Bagisto has Normal &amp; Blind SSTI from low-privilege user when ordering product</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21448</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 21:15:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2026-21448

POSSE lets your friends keep using whatever they use to read your stuff (e.g. social media silos like Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Neocities, etc.).
Stay in touch with friends now, not some theoretical future. POSSE is about staying in touch with current friends now, rather than the potential of staying in touch with friends in the future. 
Friends are more important than federation. By focusing on relationships that matter to people rather than architectural ideals, from a human perspective, POSSE is more important than federation. Additionally, if federated approaches take a POSSE approach first, they will likely get better adoption (everyone wants to stay in touch with their friends), and thereby more rapidly approach that federated future.
POSSE is beyond blogging. It's a key part of why and how the IndieWeb movement is different from just "everyone blog on their own site", and also different from "everyone just install and run (YourFavoriteSocialSoftware)" etc. monoculture solutions.
 for the following reasons:
Reduce 3rd party dependence. By posting directly to your own site, you're not dependent on 3rd Party services to do so -- if you can access your site, you can publish your content. On the contrary with PESOS, when the 3rd party site is down, you are unable to add content. By posting  on your own site, you create a direct ownership chain that can be traced back to you without any intervening 3rd party services (silos) TOS's getting in the way (which is a vulnerability of PESOS).Own canonical URLs to your content. Canonical URLs to your content are on your domain.Copies can cite the original. By posting content first to your own site (and thus creating a permalink for it), copies that you post on 3rd Party services can link or cite the original on your site (see syndication_formats and POSSE Notes to Twitter) Searching public content on your own domain (with any web search engine of your choice) works better than depending on silos exclusively to search your posts (e.g. Twitter for a while only showed recent tweets in search results. Facebook still has very poor search results).backfeed can be used to pull in (reverse syndicate) responses from other servicesallows taking advantage of other services' social layers and aggregation features while storing the canonical copy of your content on your own siteCommon  practice is to link from POSSE copies to your original, using a permashortlink. Here are a few reasons why:
Discovery of your original content.discovery of your original content from the copies on 3rd party services is enabled by the permashortlinks to your originals posted on said servicesSubvert spammers who copy your posts. When spammers (e.g. @sin3rss) mindlessly copy from your POSSE copies and repost, they also copy the link back to the original, and thus provide more distribution for people to find and view your original post. "2011-01-09 internet aikido" of a sort.Better ranking for your original posts. If/when your POSSE copies are themselves copied by others and (re)posted elsewhere (e.g. manual retweets, RSS bots etc.), when the copies link to your original posts, search engines figure that out by following those links back to the original and ranking it higher.This section is for web developers implementing POSSE.
The details of how to do so vary per destination. See the silo-specific sections below.
Once you have posted the copy to the silo, you should:
link to the syndicated copy from the original in a  section on your post.The best user interface (UI) is automatic, dependable, and invisible. If you can implement POSSEing in a way that always does exactly what you want, predictably, then no explicit UI is needed.
One way to provide more predictability and inspire confidence is to show what will be POSSEd (within the limitations of the destination) as a preview before publishing
Twitter is perhaps the most popular POSSE destination and a good place to start.
If you can start posting notes (tweets) to your own site and POSSEing to Twitter,  posting directly to Twitter, you have taken a big step towards owning your data.
See POSSE to Twitter for details on how to POSSE both notes and articles (blog posts) to Twitter.
There are two options for POSSEing to Facebook currently:
Software and libraries to implement POSSE:
PHP
The POSSE namespace in php-helpers (might be moved to a separate package) contains various truncation, preparation and syndication functions including HTML => plaintext µblog syntax converterPython
SiloRider is a command-line tool, implemented in Python, that lets you implement POSSE to various services (Twitter and Mastodon as of 2018-08-01).Feed2Toot is another command-line python tool that parses any number of RSS feeds and posts their content on ActivityPub based services (tested with: Mastodon, Pleroma). Contains some neat bells and whistles like advanced post filtering, numerous options for feed parsing and toot formatting.There's at least two ways to implement a POSSE content posting flow:
The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client
Optional: client provides UI for selecting which 3rd party services to push to if it knows about them, with optional customizations for per serviceHaving finished the content, the user publishes content to their server (optionally: with metadata of which 3rd party services and any customizations thereof)
Optional: client can generate a permalink knowing the state of the server, and publish to that permalinkThe server publishes the content, generates a permalink and summary (and/or customized content suited to 3rd party services) if necessaryThe server posts copies with permalinks to 3rd party servicesUser only has to interact with one site over the internet, their ownSyndication can be done fully automatically by the serverThe user writes a piece of content using a publishing clientHaving finished the content, the user publishes it to their serverThe client queries the server for the URL of the content it just pushedThe publishing client presents the user with an interface for selecting:
Which 3rd party services to publish toThe exact content published to the services, pre-filled with a summary based on the produced contentThe user selects the services and submits the formThe publishing client posts the content summaries out to the 3rd party servicesMore user control over timing and editing of copies of content to 3rd party servicesSyndication requires a manual step each timeDependent on client connectivity directly to 3rd party services (problematic in flakey mobile situations, or when client is publishing using domain-censored internet access).The following IndieWebCamp participants'  support a POSSE architecture. If you have an implementation, add it, make screenshots or a screencast or blog about it and post the details/link here. In date order (earliest first) :
all self-hosted posts are openly with PuSH v0.4 + h-feed and Atom real-time syndicated with a PubsubHubbub hub to StatusNet, other subscribers etc. (also to Google Buzz til it shutdown)note (and article titles), reply, RSVP posts are snowflake copied by the personal site server to Twitter with permashortlink citation links/references (see Whistle for details) back to the original. Copies of notes to Twitter are also automatically recopied from there to Facebook.
RSVPs to Facebook events are "copied" (more like propagated) to Facebook using Bridgy publishlikes of tweets are "copied" (more like propagated) to Twitter using Bridgy publishas of 2012-09-25 all collections (notes, articles, activity) are PuSH-subscribable feeds.Using the Client to Server to 3rd Parties flow --Waterpigs.co.uk 06:08, 25 September 2012 (PDT)Syndicating to Twitter + FacebookAs of 2014-06-19 Taproot can now optionally post additional POSSE tweets when updating a note or article — example of updated note and POSSE tweet for the update. Note that Bridgy successfully backfeeds silo interactions from the update tweet as well as the original POSSE tweet First post POSSE'd on 2012-11-05. I primarily syndicate to Twitter using a very lo-fi solution of adding silo (Facebook, Twiiter, Google+) provided share links to each post that I can manually click to prefill content, edit and post. I've avoided API integration because of the extensive experience I've had using Facebook API and dealing with it's random changes. "Integration" has high costs sometimes so I keep it as simple as possible.
 as of 2013-05-31 [9]. Ben Werdmuller implemented POSSE in his idno platform via plugins. New content has an associated Activity Streams object type; POSSE plugins listen for post events associated with those object types and syndicate appropriately.
Notes and articles are syndicated to Twitter and FacebookImages are syndicated to Facebook, Flickr and TwitterPlaces are syndicated to FoursquareMore plugins are very easily possible; the Foursquare plugin took about an hour to build as of 2014-01-14 Glenn Jones The blog implemented POSSE using a new version of transmat.io system. New content added to transmat is associated with objects types. A POSSE twitter plugins listens for post events syndicating content. At moment only notes are syndicated. 
Previously working on Wordpress but he was not keen on the UX.Has reply contexts working but has to manually copy the ID.Not yet POSSEing photos but plans to.Currently he has to manually copy the tweet from the main text box to a 140 character limit tweet text box. He plans to make that automatic.The new blogs and notes are posted on DrupalUsing Rebrandly to create shortlinks for the RSS FeedUsing Zapier to share the newly created rebrandly links to Twitter and LinkedinSiloRider is CMS independent -- it only relies on Microformats found in the published markup.New articles are posted as title and link.New microblogging updates are mostly copied verbatim (if the fit the external service's character limits), and support photo posts, including multi-photo posts.Notes have been POSSEd since he first started posting them on his own site, on 2019-01-16 has been syndicating his notes from his own site to:
micro.blog using micro.blog's feed polling systemThe fediverse using fed.brid.gyThis syndication happens automatically whenever James posts a note using his Micropub client or his Microsub feed reader.
... Add a link to your POSSE–enabled site and the date you started syndicating copies of your content out to 3rd party social sharing/publishing services.
Sites which only POSSE some of their content, and still post directly to the same silo they POSSE to.
Other partial POSSE sites:
 implements a partial POSSE with the following setups:
SNSAPI is a lightweight middleware to unify the data structure and interfaces of different social networking services. It gives the scripting flexibility for developer users to manipulate social silos.SNSRouter is a web UI built upon SNSAPI where one can read an aggregated timeline from different sites, mass forward messages, and update statuses on all channels.As is said in one of the description paragraph above, this model is not truly POSSE. One can not (hardly) distinguish original/ syndicated status. I'm planning to put a page with permlink on my site upon each status update and then use SNSAPI to syndicate to other silos. is short for Create Once, Publish Everywhere (COPE), which explicitly lacks a first "Publish Once" step, and thus is more about duplicating the content across various destinations.
Without a first "Publish Once" step on a site you "Own", and thus lacking original post permalinks, the COPE strategy fails to actually draw people to any one canonical place to read/view your stuff, and thus all it does is grow (likely) disjoint audiences across other people’s sites.
POSE, Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere, was a broader predecessor of POSSE that also included publishing once on one particular silo, and then syndicating out to other silos.
A similar but opposite approach is PESOS where content is posted first to 3rd party services and then copied/syndicated into a personal site. 
If exact copies of content are posted on both a personal site and 3rd party services, there's no way to tell (short of comparing possibly non-existent sub-second accurate published dates) whether a site is using POSSE or PESOS. Sites can provably support POSSE by including perma(short)links in syndicated copies that link/reference back to published originals.
PESETAS is like PESOS but copying/syndicating everything to a particular silo (without any involvement of a personal site).
For example, most silos support cross-posting to Twitter, thus you could connect everything to your Twitter account and always (auto-)cross-post there to keep a copy. 
Tumblr is a better PESETAS destination however, since it is well established, allows for a wider variety of content, and allows more text, and links to URLs directly instead of linkwrapping them like Twitter does.
All of the above, and to date (2013-222), POSSE has solely described syndicating the reation of content on your site (publishing) to other sites. This model has been quite successful and perhaps may be sufficient.
However, it is worth exploring the potential utility of a full CRUD protocol for POSSE.
Create is the POSSE default. You create content on your site, you POSSE your creates to other sites. All of this is described above, and in silo-specific details on silo pages.
Read as a verb is interesting when applied to POSSE.
At a minimum, it's useful to implement storing links to syndicated copies of your content to provide for the future possibility of reading from downstream POSSE copies.
Actual direct uses of Reading from downstream POSSE copies:
In addition, keeping a u-syndication link to the POSSE copy enables deleting it to perform an Update or a Delete action, as described in the following sections.
If a POSSE destination allows updates/edits, then when you edit your post, you could propagate that update to the downstream POSSE copy as well.
E.g. Facebook allows editing the text of a post (including any links in the text), person tags, but not the image of a photo postIf the destination disallows updates/edits, like Twitter, it is still possible to virtually POSSE updates by deleting the POSSE tweet and reposting, i.e.:
Consider only POSSEing updates to Twitter:
if no one has replied to it yet (otherwise you'd break a threaded conversation on Twitter)if your changes would be shown in the truncated copy on Twitter (i.e. if your changes are past the 140 (more like 120) character horizon, no point in churning the Twitter copy).within a very short time window, maybe like 2-5 minutes, because otherwise the update will be seen as a duplicate to people who are reading you on Twitter.All of these concerns are regarding the experience that you provide to your friends reading your tweets on Twitter, which of course should be the whole (design) reason you're bothering to POSSE to Twitter in the first place.
For details, see silo-specific POSSE sections:
Flickr: (UI supports manually updating the image of a photo post, but is that available in the API? and if so, file a Bridgy Publish feature request GitHub issue to support POSSE Update to Flickr (including the image of a photo post)Deletes seem fairly straightforward to POSSE, especially to services which themselves propagate deletes to clients.
E.g. one can delete a note on Twitter at any point.
Similar to updates, consider:
if there are already replies to a POSSE copy (or activity like favorites/retweets), consider keeping it to keep conversation threading (and others' favorites/retweets).However, if you really feel like deleting the content from your site and POSSE copies (e.g. on Twitter), go ahead and do so. 
Perhaps this is an opportunity for the UI for the deletion of a post to check to see if there's been any activity (replies, favorites, retweets) on the POSSE copy before performing the delete. One possible implementation could involve the UI informing the user of this activity (or lack of it) and reconfirming the delete request on a per-service basis.
Q: Do we need to worry about search engines penalizing apparently duplicate posts?
A: That's why the POSSE copies SHOULD always link back to the originals. So that search engines can infer that the copies are just copies. Ideally POSSE copies on silos should use rel-canonical to link back to the originals, but even without explicit rel-canonical, the explicit link back to the original is a strong hint that it is an original.
This is also an advantage of POSSE over PESOS. With PESOS - there's no way to tell what's the original and what's the copy - so they do look like duplicates.
Q: Brid.gy can use posse-post-discovery to find the relationship between a syndicated post and the original when there is not explicit link. Does this mean I should stop adding backlinks to syndicated copies?
sometime before 2014-06-21[11]:  (Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere) term defined at some point prior to POSSE. Conceptually it was looser than POSSE, as "once" could be interpreted as on a silo rather than your "own site", which POSSE (and the conceptual predecessors) made explicit.Articles and blog posts about POSSE, especially implementing it:
As discussed #indieweb it is also possible POSSE your git repositories to git "silos", such as GitHub or GitLab. An easy way of doing this was described by  at [12].

Not "strong student" good. More like "this reads like a McKinsey memo that went through three rounds of editing," good.So we started cold calling students randomly during class.The result was... illuminating. Many students who had submitted thoughtful, well-structured work could not explain basic choices in their own submission after two follow-up questions. Some could not participate at all. This gap was too consistent to blame on nerves or bad luck. If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring.Brian Jabarian has been doing interesting work on this problem, having shown that AI is actually better than humans at conducting job interviews. Why? Humans get tired, have biases, and are less consistent at following a script. His results both inspired us and gave us the confidence to try something that would have sounded absurd two years ago: running the final exam with a Voice AI agent.Why oral exams? And why now?The core problem is simple: students have immediate access to LLMs that can handle most exam questions we traditionally use for assessment. The old equilibrium, where take-home work could reliably measure understanding, is dead. Gone. Kaput.We can go pen and paper in the classroom. We did that as well for the midterm.Oral exams are another natural response. They force real-time reasoning, application to novel prompts, and defense of actual decisions. The problem? Oral exams are a logistical nightmare. You cannot run them for a large class without turning the final exam period into a month-long hostage situation.We used ElevenLabs Conversational AI to build the examiner. The platform bundles the messy parts (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, turn-taking, interruption handling, …) into something usable. And here is the thing that surprised me: a basic version for a low-stakes setting (e.g., an assignment) can be up and running in literally minutes. Minutes. Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done.Two features mattered a lot for our setup: pass the student's name, project details, and other per-student context into the conversation as parameters build a structured flow with sub-agents instead of a single "chatty" agent trying to do everythingWhat the exam looked likeWe ran a two-part oral exam.Part 1: "Talk me through your project." The agent asks about the student's capstone project: goals, data, modeling choices, evaluation, failure modes. This is where the "LLM did my homework" strategy dies. You can paste an assignment into ChatGPT. It is much harder to improvise consistent answers about specific decisions when someone is drilling into details. The agent picks one of the cases we discussed in class and asks questions spanning the topics we covered: basically testing whether students absorbed the material or just showed up.To handle this structure, we split the exam into sub-agents in a workflow: Asks for the student's ID and refuses to proceed without a valid one. (In a more productized version, we would integrate with NYU SSO instead of checking against a list.)Project discussion agent: Gets project context injected via parameters. The prompt includes details of each project so the agent can ask informed questions. The next step is obvious: connect retrieval over the student's submitted slides and reports so the agent can quote and probe precisely. Selects a case and runs structured questioning. Again, RAG would help with richer case details.This "many small agents" approach is not just aesthetic. It prevents the system from drifting into unbounded conversation, and it makes debugging possible.Link to try the voice agent(use Konstantinos as the name and kr888 as the net id to authenticate; the project was a "LinkedIn Recruiter, an agent that scans profiles and automatically sends personalized DMs to candidates on behalf of a recruiter. It engages in the first 3 turns of chat to answer basic questions (salary, location) before handing off to a human."36 students examined over 9 days25 minutes average (range: 9–64)65 messages per conversation on average0.42 USD per student (15 USD total)89% of LLM grades within 1 pointShortest exam (9 min) → highest score (19/20)Total cost for 36 students: .That's 8 USD for Claude (the chair and heaviest grader), 2 USD for Gemini, 0.30 USD for OpenAI, and roughly 5 USD for ElevenLabs voice minutes. Forty-two cents per student.The alternative? 36 students × 25-minute exam × 2 graders = 30 hours of human time. At TA rates (~25/hour), that's 750. At faculty rates, it's "we don't do oral exams because they don't scale."For 15 dollars, we got: real-time oral examination, a three-model grading council with deliberation, structured feedback with verbatim quotes, a complete audit trail, and—as you'll see—a diagnosis of our own teaching gaps.The unit economics in terms of cost work. We will see next that the real benefit is in the value that is delivered, not in the 50x cost savings.What broke (and how we fixed it)The first version had problems. Here is what we learned.1) The voice was intimidatingA few students complained that the agent sounded severe. We had cloned Foster Provost's voice because, frankly, his clone was much more accurate than the clones of our own voices. But the students found it... intense. Here is an email from a student:I had prepared thoroughly and felt confident in my understanding of the material, but the intensity of the interviewer's voice during the exam unexpectedly heightened my anxiety and affected my performance. The experience was more triggering than I anticipated, which made it difficult to fully demonstrate my knowledge. Throughout the course, I have actively participated and engaged with the material, and I had hoped to better demonstrate my knowledge in this interview.Just got done with my oral exam. [...] I honestly didn't feel comfortable with it at all. The voice you picked was so condescending that it actually dropped my confidence. [...] I don't know why but the agent was shouting at me.2) The agent stacked questionsThis was the biggest real issue. The agent would ask something like: "Explain your metric choice, and also tell me what baselines you tried, and why you did not use X, and what you would do next."That is not one question. That is four questions wearing a trench coat. The cognitive load for an oral exam is already high. Stacking questions makes it brutal. Hard rule in the prompt: . If you want multi-part probing, chain it across turns. For grading the exam, we included an "interference protocol": students received full credit if they had questions stacked like that and answered only some of them.3) Clarifications became moving targetsStudent: "Can you repeat the question?"
Agent: paraphrases the question in a subtly different wayNow the student is solving a different problem than the one they were asked. Very frustrating. Explicit instruction in the prompt: repeat verbatim when asked to repeat. No paraphrasing. Same words.4) The agent did not let students thinkHumans rush to fill silence. Agents do too. Students would pause to think, and the agent would jump in with follow-up probes or worse: interpret the silence as confusion and move on. Tell the agent to allow think-time without probing aggressively. It made the exam feel less like an interrogation. We also increased the time-out before the agent asks "Are you there?" from 5 to 10 seconds.We asked the agent to "randomly select" a case study. It did not.From December 12–18, when Zillow was in the case list, the agent picked Zillow . After we removed Zillow from the prompt on December 18, the agent immediately latched onto Predictive Policing—picking it for  on December 19 alone.LLMs are not random. They have implicit preferences and ordering biases. Asking an LLM to "pick randomly" is like asking a human to "think of a number between 1 and 10"—you're going to get a lot of 7s. Pass an explicit random number as a parameter and map it to cases deterministically. Do the randomization in code, not in the prompt.Grading: the council deliberation actually workedOK, so here is where things got interesting.We graded using a "council of LLMs" approach, an idea we borrowed from Andrej Karpathy. Three models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) assessed each transcript independently. Then they saw each other's assessments and revised. Finally, the chair (Claude) synthesized the final grade with evidence.. When the models graded independently, agreement was poor: 0% of grades matched exactly, and only 23% were within 2 points. The average maximum disagreement was nearly 4 points on a 20-point scale.And here's the kicker: Gemini was a softie: It averaged 17/20. Claude averaged 13.4/20. That's a 3.6-point gap—the difference between a B+ and a B-.Meanwhile, Claude and OpenAI were already aligned: 70% of their grades were within 1 point of each other in Round 1.Then came consultation. After each model saw the others' assessments and evidence, agreement improved dramatically:Gemini lowered its grades by an average of 2 points after seeing Claude's and OpenAI's more rigorous assessments. It couldn't justify giving 17s when Claude was pointing to specific gaps in the experimentation discussion.But here's what's interesting: the disagreement wasn't random. Problem Framing and Metrics had  within 1 point. Experimentation? Only .Why? When students give clear, specific answers, graders agree. When students give vague hand-wavy answers, graders (human or AI) disagree on how much partial credit to give. The low agreement on experimentation reflects genuine ambiguity in student responses, not grader noise.The grading was stricter than my own default. That's not a bug. Students will be evaluated outside the university, and the world is not known for grade inflation. (Just in case you are wondering, I graded all exams myself and I asked the TA to also grade the exams; we mostly agreed with the LLM grades, and I aligned mostly with the softie Gemini. However, when examining the cases when my grades disagreed with the council, I found that the council was more consistent across students and I often thought that the council graded more strictly but more fairly.)The feedback was better than any human would produce. The system generated structured "strengths / weaknesses / actions" summaries with verbatim quotes from the transcript. Sample feedback from the highest scorer:"Your understanding of metric trade-offs and Goodhart's Law risks was exceptional—the hot tub example perfectly illustrated how optimizing for one metric can corrupt another."Sample from a B- student:"Practice articulating complete A/B testing designs: state a hypothesis, define randomization unit, specify guardrail metrics, and establish decision criteria for shipping or rolling back."Specific. Actionable. Tied to evidence. No human grader has the time to generate that for every student.It diagnosed our teaching gapsWhen we analyzed performance by topic, one bar stuck out like a sore thumb: . Mean score: 1.94 out of 4. Compare that to Problem Framing at 3.39.The breakdown was brutal:3 students (8%) scored —couldn't discuss it at all7 students (19%) scored —superficial understanding15 students (42%) scored —basic understanding0 students scored —no one demonstrated masteryWe had rushed through A/B testing methodology in class. The external grader made it impossible to ignore.The grading output became a mirror reflecting our own weaknesses as instructors. Ooof.One finding I found strangely fascinating: exam duration had  with score (r = -0.03). The shortest exam—9 minutes—got the highest score (19/20). The longest—64 minutes—scored 12/20.Taking longer doesn't mean you know more. If anything, it signals struggling to articulate. Confidence is efficient.Anti-cheating (or: trust but verify)We asked students to  while taking the exam (webcam + audio). This discourages blatantly outsourcing the conversation, having multiple people in the room, or having an LLM in voice mode whispering answers. It also gives us a backup record in case something goes really badly.And here is an underrated benefit of this whole setup: the exam is powered by guidelines, not by secret questions. We can publish exactly how the exam works—the structure, the skills being tested, the types of questions. No surprises. The LLM will pick the specific questions live, and the student will have to handle them.This reduces anxiety and pushes students toward actual preparation instead of guessing what the instructor "wants." And it eliminates the leaked-exam problem entirely. Practice all you want—it will only make you better prepared.We surveyed students before releasing grades to capture their experience. Some of the results:Only 13% preferred the AI oral format. 57% wanted traditional written exams. 83% found it more stressful.But here's the thing: 70% agreed it tested their actual understanding: the highest-rated item. They accepted the assessment but not the delivery.At the same time, they almost universally liked the flexibility of taking the exam at their own place and time. Yes, many of them would have also preferred a take-home exam instead of the oral exam, but this format is dead now.83% of students found the oral exam framework more stressful than a written exam.The fix is clear: one question at a time, slower pacing, calmer tone. The concept works. The execution needs iteration.If you want to experiment with this approach, here are some resources:Link to try the voice agent(use Konstantinos as the name and kr888 as the net id to authenticate; the project was a "LinkedIn Recruiter, an agent that scans profiles and automatically sends personalized DMs to candidates on behalf of a recruiter. It engages in the first 3 turns of chat to answer basic questions (salary, location) before handing off to a human."What I would change next timeSlower pacing and a calmer voice: We love you FakeFoster, but GenZ is not ready for you. Perhaps we will deploy FakePanos next time. Too bad ElevenLabs hasn't perfected thick accents yet to deliver a real Panos experience.RAG over student artifacts (slides, reports, notebooks). ElevenLabs supports this directly. If the agent can quote the student's own submission, the exam becomes much harder to game and much more diagnostically useful.Better case randomization with explicit seeding and tracking. Randomness that "feels random" is not enough. Pass explicit parameters.Audit triggers in grading. If the LLM committee disagrees beyond a threshold, flag for human review. The point of a committee is not to pretend the result is always certain; it is to surface uncertainty. Offer practice runs, allow extra time, and provide alternatives when voice interaction creates unnecessary barriers.Take-home exams are dead. Reverting to pen-and-paper exams in the classroom feels like a regression. In our case, we wanted to check that the students who worked in the team projects actually contributed and understood what they submitted; we would not be able to do that with pen-and-paper exams in the classroom.We need assessments that evolve towards formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning. Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale. Now, AI is making them scalable again.And here is the delicious part: you can give the whole setup to the students and let them prepare for the exam by practicing it multiple times. Unlike traditional exams, where leaked questions are a disaster, here the questions are generated fresh each time. The more you practice, the better you get. That is... actually how learning is supposed to work.Thanks to Brian Jabarian for the inspiration and for giving us confidence that these interviews will work, Foster Provost for lending his voice to create the FakeFoster agent (sorry, students found you intimidating!), and Andrej Karpathy for the council-of-LLMs idea.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Accounting for Computer Scientists (2011)</title><link>https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/07/accounting-for-computer-scientists.html</link><author>tosh</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 18:16:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Published by Martin Kleppmann on 07 Mar 2011.Every educated person really ought to have a basic understanding of accounting. Just like
maths, science, programming, music, literature, history, etc., it’s one of those things
which helps you make sense of the world. Although dealing with money is not much fun, it’s
an unavoidable part of life, so you might as well take a few minutes to understand it.Sadly, in my opinion, most accountants do a terrible job of explaining their work in an
accessible way; it’s a field full of jargon, acronyms and weird historical legacies. Even
“Bookkeeping for Dummies” makes my head spin. Surely this stuff can’t be that difficult?(We computing people are probably guilty of the same offence of bad explanations and jargon.
The problem is, once you have become intimately familiar with a field, it’s very hard to
imagine how you thought about things before you understood it.)Eventually I figured it out: basic accounting is just graph theory. The traditional ways
of representing financial information hide that structure astonishingly well, but once I
had figured out that it was just a graph, it suddenly all made sense.I’m a computer scientist, and I think of stuff in graphs all the time. If only someone had
explained it like that in the first place! It would have saved me so much confusion. So I
want to try to fix that. If you like graphs, then by the time you reach the end of this
article, you should know everything you need in order to understand the financial statements
for a small company/startup (and even calculate them yourself, in a spreadsheet or
programming language of your choice).It’s really not that hard. Let’s go!Accounts = Nodes, Transactions = EdgesSay you go to the bagel shop and buy a Super Club bagel for $5 on the company credit card.
You also visit some random Silicon Valley startup and buy one of their surplus Aeron chairs, second
hand, for $500 (by writing a cheque from the company account). Those are two transactions.
Each transaction is an edge in our graph, and the edge is labelled with the amount.An edge always goes from one node to another. What are those nodes? Well, you can define
them as you like (although there are some conventions). For now, let’s say:Let’s add some more details. You pay the $5 credit card bill from the company account. And where
did the money in the company account come from in the first place? Ah, I see, you
put in $5,000 of your savings to start the company. Ok, now the graph looks like this:Hopefully pretty self-explanatory so far. Money flows in the direction of the arrows.Hungry once again, you go to the taqueria and buy a Super Burrito for $8 on the credit card.
Now we could create another node for the taqueria, but this is starting to get messy – we
don’t really care how much money we spent on bagels vs. how much on burritos. Let’s just
lump them together as “food”. Also, “Random startup” is a bit unhelpful – I’ve already
forgotten what those $500 were for. Let’s call it “furniture” instead.See, that’s perfectly fine. We can have nodes which represent actual bank accounts or cards,
others which represent people or companies, and others again which represent abstract
categories like “food” or “furniture”. Just throw it all into the same graph.Note also that you can have several edges between the same pair of nodes. You can keep track
of the individual edges, or you can simply add them up. (Using the credit card, you spent
a total of $13 on food.)Every node in this graph is an  in accountant-speak (whether or not it is held by a bank),
and every account has a . The balance is a single number for each account, and it is
determined completely by the transactions in and out of the account:At the beginning of time, the value at each node is zero.At each node, for each incoming edge, add the edge’s label to the node’s value; for each
outgoing edge, subtract the edge’s label from the value.After you’ve processed all the edges, the value at each node is that account’s balance. Our
graph now looks like this:Note that the account balances have two nice properties:Because every transaction appears twice – once positive and once negative – the sum of
all account balances is always zero.If you partition the set of nodes into any two disjoint sets, and add up all of the balances
in each set, then the sum for the one set is always the negative sum of the other set
(because, after all, they have to add up to zero).These properties are useful for sanity-checking your numbers; if they are violated,
. (This is what accountants mean when they talk about “balancing the books”.)Strengthened by a bagel and a burrito, you go out and talk to some potential customers. And hey,
they love your product! It has a price tag of $5,000, and you sell it to two big enterprise
customers. One pays you right away (good stuff!); the other gives you $2,500 up front, but insists
that before they pay the rest, you need to implement that additional feature you foolishly
promised.So you received $5,000 + $2,500 in cash from your customers, wired straight the company bank
account. Let’s add that to the graph:But that’s not quite right. The price was $5,000 for each customer, and now it looks like you
charged two different prices. How do we represent our arrangement with customer 2?The solution is to deconstruct the deal into two separate transactions: the sale (in which
the buyer agrees to buy, but no actual money changes hands) and the payment (when the cash
actually hits your bank account). We can draw it like this:See what I’ve done here? I’ve just made up a new node, generically called it “sales”, and
added the actual $5,000 sales as a transaction from this “sales” account to the customer
accounts. Adding this extra node hasn’t changed your bank balance.This makes sense when you think about the intuitive meaning of the balances.
The balance of each customer’s account is the amount they owe you: customer 1
has fully paid up (their incoming and outgoing transactions add up to the same), so their balance
is zero; customer 2 has contractually agreed to give you $5,000, but has so far only given you
half of that, so their balance is $2,500.And the balance on the sales account is the value of stuff you’ve sold. Or rather, the negative
value. That looks a bit weird… but I’ll come back to that later. (BTW, if you wanted to
separately track sales for different customers or different products, no problem — just
add whatever nodes make sense for you. Just make sure that every transaction appears only
once as an edge, otherwise you’re making stuff up!)Finishing off the exampleTo round it off, let me add some more events to the story (= some more edges to the graph).Not only have you made some sales, but now you also receive a $20,000 investment from
Y Combinator — congratulations! You and your co-founder can now afford to pay yourselves
a salary. You take $8,000 out of the company account.Then you get set up with a company accountant, and they talk lots of jargon at you. For
some strange reason they are obsessed with correctly accounting for your office chair;
they want it to depreciate over four years, i.e. its value is gradually reduced to zero over
the course of that time. Fair enough, you say (even though you couldn’t care less what your
chair will be worth in four years’ time — surely by that time you’ll be the next Google
or Facebook, and you’ll have other things to worry about than chairs).The resulting graph now looks like this:Note how I have represented the transactions:I have lumped together your founder investment with that of Y Combinator, under the
heading of “capital”. Put simply, this is money you got into the company by selling your
company’s shares, rather than by selling a product or service to a customer. As usual,
you can split founders and YC into separate accounts if you feel like it.I’ve represented payroll (salaries) as just money straight out of the bank account. In
reality it’s a bit more complicated due to taxes, healthcare, benefits, etc. but the
principles stay the same. It’s just more nodes and edges in the graph.I made depreciation for one year (one quarter of $500 = $125) go  from the
“furniture” account. Intuitively, this means that the balance of the “furniture” account
is the value that your furniture still has now. Each year, you add another $125 edge
from “furniture” to “depreciation”, until after four years, the balance of “furniture”
drops to zero (assuming you haven’t bought any more chairs in the meantime, in your quest
for world domination).The profit and loss statementAt this point, if you’re getting weary, I don’t blame you. But the good news: we’ve finished
building our graph! Now I will show you how this graph representation maps to two standard
financial statements most commonly used in managing a company: the profit and loss statement
(“P&L”), and the balance sheet. This is useful, because as a startup founder you’ll sooner
or later have to discuss these documents with your investors/advisors, and so you might as
well learn what the hell they mean.In order to produce these statements, I need to get out the crayons. Here is the same graph
as before, with the nodes coloured in:Explaining the colours (putting the accounting terminology in brackets, since you’re likely to
encounter these words):Green for  (), e.g. money in the bank, or things which you
bought and you could sell again, such as furniture. Also green for people/companies who
 (, such as Customer 2), and people/companies to whom  (“liabilities”/”creditors”, such as your upcoming credit card bill for that burrito).Blue for sales of your product/service () and  that you’re not going
to get back (). The office chair is green, because you could sell it
again if you wanted to, but the bagel is blue, because once you’ve bought (and eaten) the
bagel, that’s it – no going back.Pink for  (or yourself) that you got by selling shares ().
(If you get a bank loan, that’s green, not pink, because you owe the bank to pay it back.)Every one of your nodes should fall into exactly one of these categories. If not, something
has gone wrong, or you have discovered some bit of the accounting world that I don’t yet know
about.With these colours set, the profit and loss statement is simply a list of all the blue nodes,
and the profit or loss of the company is the sum of all of the blue nodes’ balances. The way we’ve
calculated things, a negative value is a profit, and a positive value is a loss. That’s confusing,
so you typically flip the sign when reporting the number (so that a profit is positive).Written in the standard way, our P&L looks like this:(= total revenue - total expenses)The meaning is fairly intuitive. You sold $10,000 worth of stuff, and spent only $8,138 in the
process, so you made $1,862 profit.The profit and loss statement is calculated over a period of time (usually a month, a quarter or a
year), and it’s often interesting to compare two different periods. To calculate it for a period,
filter your transactions to only include those which occurred within that period, and add up the
account balances for just those transactions.One thing to watch out for: profit doesn’t say anything about your bank account. The bank account
is a green node, but we’re only looking at blue nodes here. In this example, you ended up with
$23,995 in the bank, even though investors put in $25,000: you made a profit, yet still have less
money in the bank than you did before, because Customer 2 hasn’t yet fully paid. That’s why it’s
possible for a company to be profitable but still run out of money!The balance sheet is a bit less intuitive than the P&L, but it’s quite a powerful document. It
summarises what the company currently has and doesn’t have, and why.Remember what I said earlier about partitioning the nodes into two disjoint sets, and their
summed balances adding to zero? That’s exactly what happens on the balance sheet. We take all of
the nodes in the graph; on the one side we consider all of the green nodes, and on the other side
all the blue and pink nodes. The sum of all of the blue and pink nodes’ balances is minus the sum
of all of the green nodes’ balances.Now, by convention, accountants flip the sign on all of the blue and pink nodes’ balances, which
means that the two sums end up being equal. And that’s why it’s called a balance sheet.In our example, it looks like this:Total assets less total liabilitiesThe top block (assets and liabilities) corresponds to the green nodes in the graph, whilst
the bottom block contains the pink node (capital) and the sum of all of the blue nodes. We already
showed all of the detail for the blue nodes on the Profit and Loss statement above; on the balance
sheet we can sum them all up to a single number.Some more sign-flipping has occurred here: I’ve written liabilities, equity and P&L with their
signs flipped (which usually, but not always, has the effect of making the numbers positive).
That doesn’t change anything fundamental about the graph structure, it just puts things into the
conventional schema.So how can you interpret the balance sheet? There are various things you can read from it. You can
see how much money is in the bank, and how much of that money has already been promised to other
people (liabilities). You can see how much of the money in the bank came from investors, vs. how
much came from sales. And it shows how much money is due to come in soon, from sales that have
closed but haven’t yet been fully paid.The total of the balance sheet is a lower bound on the value of your company. It’s a very
pessimistic figure — it assumes that your team, your technology, your brand etc. are all worth
precisely nothing; if your company raises money from investors, your valuation will be much higher
than the balance sheet figure, since that valuation includes the value of team, technology, brand
etc in the form of a wild guess. In established companies you can find “intangible assets” on the
balance sheet, but since they are very hard to value, I suspect it’s not worth bothering with
unless you know what you are doing.That’s the end of our whirlwind tour through the world of accounting. If you’re a real accountant
reading this, please forgive my simplifications; if you spot any mistakes, please let me know.

Note: this is not an RCE but a memory leak; nonetheless, RCE could likely follow.TL;DR for Engineering Teams: MongoDB’s zlib decompression mishandles buffer lengths.: Not an RCE but a memory leak; nonetheless, it could be chained with other popular RCEs such as React2Shell.: Uninitialized heap memory from the database process.: Over 87,000 internet-facing MongoDB instances observed.: Memory can contain credentials, tokens, PII, and internal paths.: Upgrade immediately or disable zlib compression.: Public PoC exists. Scanning is trivial. This will be abused.MongoDB is a popular database and has a memory access issue (MongoBleed).MongoDB supports network message compression. When a client sends a compressed message, it includes a field called uncompressedSize. MongoDB allocates a buffer of that size before passing the payload to zlib.Attacker sends a crafted message with an inflated uncompressedSize.MongoDB allocates a large heap buffer.zlib only decompresses the real payload into the start of that buffer.The remaining buffer space stays uninitialized.MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid BSON.BSON parsing walks into leftover heap memory.At that point, the database starts leaking whatever was in memory previously.The challenge is: there is no crash. No auth failure. Just data bleeding out.The resemblance to Heartbleed is not accidental. Same class of bug. Same trust failure. Same outcome. The difference is that there is no known RCE attached to this yet…Campaign to identify if your libraries are affected by the MongoBleed CVE-2025-14847 in Leverage the Phoenix Security SCA Scanner and the container Docker image scanner to identify the vulnerability blast radius Leverage Phoenix Security Filters and the campaign method to update/ retrieve the new vulnerabilities, or import this file: Check the libraries not affected in SBOM screen to detect mongobleed (search the following libraries) Check Vulnerability Screen in Phoenix SecurityPOC and Exploit for CVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed) A working proof of concept for CVE-2025-14847, commonly referred to as MongoBleed, is publicly available and demonstrates how trivial exploitation is once network access to a vulnerable MongoDB instance exists. The PoC, published by Joe Desimone, implements the exact compression-size mismatch condition that triggers uninitialized-heap disclosure by sending syntactically valid zlib-compressed messages with attacker-controlled uncompressed-length fields. The exploit requires no authentication, no malformed compression streams, and no timing conditions. Check out the exploit below and the lab to test here: The underlying mechanics and exploitation flow were first detailed in Kevin Beaumont’s technical analysis, which walks through the memory disclosure behavior and validates the issue against real MongoDB deployments. In addition to the original PoC, test harnesses and scanning tooling are available to reproduce the issue locally, assess exposed services, and validate vulnerable container images, including Docker-based environments. The availability of ready-to-run exploit code materially lowers the effort required to weaponize this vulnerability and increases the likelihood of opportunistic scanning against exposed MongoDB instances.Link – incident write-up and PoC testing notes.Exploit Lab, Network Scanner, and Code Scanner ToolingPhoenix Security clients can already verify results with SCA, the container registry scanner, and the external scanner for internet-exposed systems.To support validation, detection, and remediation workflows, Phoenix Security has released a full MongoBleed test suite that combines an exploit lab, a network scanner, and a code scanner in a single repository. You can access the repo and run the scanners from here.The exploit lab provides a controlled Docker-based environment with both vulnerable and patched MongoDB instances, allowing teams to safely reproduce the memory disclosure behavior and verify the effectiveness of upgrades by observing live heap leakage versus clean rejection paths. The network scanner enables rapid identification of exposed and vulnerable MongoDB services across individual hosts, CIDR ranges, or target lists, using the same compression mismatch logic as the PoC to confirm reachability and exploitability rather than relying on version strings alone. The code scanner extends this coverage into build and supply chain workflows by inspecting repositories, Dockerfiles, and infrastructure definitions to detect vulnerable MongoDB versions before deployment, with optional direct upload into Phoenix Security for attribution, prioritization, and tracking. Root Cause and Technical DetailsCVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed) is caused by an incorrect propagation of decompression length semantics in MongoDB’s network transport layer when processing compressed wire-protocol messages.The vulnerability resides in MongoDB’s zlib message compression implementation, specifically in:src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cppWhen a client negotiates  and submits a compressed message, MongoDB allocates an output buffer based on the declared uncompressed size provided in the message metadata. The server then invokes  to inflate the payload into this buffer.In the vulnerable implementation, the decompression routine returns , which corresponds to the size of the allocated output buffer, rather than the number of bytes actually written by the decompressor. As a result, MongoDB treats the entire buffer as valid decompressed data, even though only a portion of it contains legitimate payload.This mismatch allows subsequent BSON parsing logic to read beyond the true decompression boundary and into uninitialized heap memory, leading to unauthenticated memory disclosure.The issue was fixed by returning the actual decompressed byte count instead of the allocated buffer length, as shown in MongoDB’s official patch:If an attacker supplies a syntactically valid compressed message whose declared uncompressed size exceeds the real decompressed length, MongoDB treats the entire allocated buffer as valid decompressed data. Subsequent message parsing and BSON handling logic consume memory beyond the true decompression boundary, resulting in the exposure of uninitialized heap memory.This condition is reachable without authentication and does not require malformed compression streams or memory corruption primitives. The exploit relies solely on a  between attacker-controlled metadata and the actual decompression output, combined with the incorrect return of allocated buffer length. The vulnerability is reliably triggered after compression negotiation and prior to authentication checks, making it reachable by any network client.The issue was remediated by modifying the decompression path to return the actual decompressed byte count (return length;) instead of the allocated buffer size. Additional regression tests were introduced in message_compressor_manager_test.cpp to explicitly detect and reject undersized decompression results, ensuring that future mismatches between declared and real decompressed sizes result in a controlled error (ErrorCodes::BadValue) rather than memory disclosure.src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cppThe fix replaces return {output.length()}; with return length;, ensuring that only the true decompressed byte count is propagated, preventing BSON parsing from walking into uninitialized memory.How Widespread Is CVE-2025-14847 (MongoBleed)?MongoDB is one of the most widely deployed database platforms on the internet, and its exposure footprint directly amplifies the risk posed by MongoBleed. We are looking at 213,490 potentially vulnerable systems on Shodan.Current Shodan telemetry identifies 213,490 publicly reachable MongoDB instances, many of which advertise versions that fall squarely within the vulnerable ranges for CVE-2025-14847.Those figures were captured on December 29, 2025.product:”MongoDB” port:27017product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “8.2.”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “8.0.” -“8.0.17”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “7.0.” -“7.0.28”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “6.0.” -“6.0.27”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “5.0.” -“5.0.32”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “4.4.” -“4.4.30”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “4.2.”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “4.0.”product:”MongoDB” port:27017 “3.6.”Distribution of various MongoDB versions.The distribution spans cloud providers, managed hosting environments, and self-hosted deployments, with a heavy concentration on the default MongoDB port , indicating direct internet exposure rather than controlled access through application tiers. The presence of affected versions across multiple major release branches, including long-lived production deployments, confirms that MongoBleed is potentially another Heartbleed-scale vulnerability.  Below the number of Vulnerable attacks detected by shadowserver (details here)Considering the low level of effort required to exploit this vulnerability, spray-and-pray opportunistic scanning significantly increases the likelihood of credential leakage, lateral movement, and downstream compromise.This vulnerability has a few traits that should make every security team uncomfortable:Unauthenticated. Any network client can trigger it. No user. No password. No role.Remote and repeatable. Attackers can probe memory offsets repeatedly and harvest fragments over time.Low noise. No malformed packets. No obvious crashes. Logs stay quiet.Data agnostic. Heap memory is messy. That’s the point.

This favors patient actors and automated tooling.The PoC already supports scanning offsets up to 50,000 bytes and dumping raw memory to disk. There is also a screenshot circulating with the PoC showing leaked system memory and runtime stats, which underscores how trivial reproduction is.Web apps. SaaS backends. Analytics stacks. Kubernetes workloads. Cloud-native services.Compression is enabled by default. Authentication is often misconfigured. Internet exposure is depressingly common.MongoBleed does not break crypto. It breaks trust.The database assumes the client is honest about lengths. Attackers live for that assumption.From an application security and DevSecOps perspective, this is a reminder that:Databases are part of your attack surface.Infrastructure bugs leak application secrets.Vulnerability management must include reachability and exposure, not just CVSS.Patch this.

This unique device, powered by AphyOS and housed within a German-built precision handset, follows through on Punkt.’s well known commitment to intentional tech use and data ownership.Like its forerunner, the MC02, the new model is a subscription-based smartphone that offers users the tools and apps that are most important to them in an environment where they control access to their data and usage.Using the Punkt. MC03, users can put privacy first with two defined repositories for depositing data. The first is named , a protected enclave containing only trusted, Punkt.-approved apps and offering maximum privacy by default with a calm, design-focused user interface. The second, termed , provides the freedom to install any app, but with strict, visible safeguards that allow easy privacy controls and can prevent data triangulation and unauthorized data flows.“Privacy is being sought by people more than ever before, particularly as we enter the age of AI,” said Petter Neby, Founder and CEO at Punkt. “They are stressed and overwhelmed by the determination of Big Tech to track and monetise their every online movement. Punkt. offers them a solution – a modern, premium device without the need to compromise on their privacy.”The MC03 features a new look and feel to its operating system allowing users to stay laser-focused on getting the best experience. AphyOS cuts out tracking and profiling technology, bloatware, hidden apps and unwieldy background services. It eliminates spying and runs hardened code to block attacks, assisted by a bank-grade Secure Element.With the MC03, Punkt. is building a secure smartphone ecosystem where privacy is not an add-on, but the default. Supported by trusted partners such as  and, new for MC03, , these services feature in the device’s Vault space.Trusted services including Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN and  are available in an environment designed to minimize data exposure and tracking.Punkt. and Proton are ideal partners, both leading within the  (with Swiss Tech you pay to retain your data, with Big Tech you pay with your data), operating independently and built around the principle that users, not platforms, control their own data.Andy Yen, Founder and CEO of Proton said, “People deserve choice. Choice over the phone they use, the software they rely on and who they share their data with. By working with likeminded companies like Punkt., we can give users more ways to regain control of their privacy.”Among other features of the MC03:Two app stores are available:A curated privacy-friendly store vetted by AphyOS and Punkt.Access to all widely available apps, activated only when chosen by the user.Manufactured at the Gigaset facility in Germany, the device delivers cutting-edge engineering for quality, security, repairability and sustainability, including:Removable 5200mAh batteryIP68 water and dust resistanceThe MC03 retains its built-in VPN, Digital Nomad, protecting connectivity and privacy wherever users are.Users control app-specific privacy, from full access to full restriction. Ledger also includes a Carbon Reduction feature, giving insights into the energy impact of installed apps and control over background activity.“The MC03 builds on the success of the MC02 in privacy, control and security,” continued Petter Neby. “It delivers modern features with simplicity and minimal distraction.”The Punkt. MC03 is priced at CHF / $ / €699.If you don’t pay for a product, you are the product. With MC03, you pay to retain your data rather than paying with it.A 12-month subscription to AphyOS from Apostrophy is included. After that, continuation requires a paid subscription:Monthly at CHF / $ / €9.99Subscription bundles are available, including a 3-year subscription at 45% discount and a 5-year subscription at 60% discount.The MC03 is available to pre-order now, with deliveries in Europe at the end of January and North America from Spring 2026.Images available for download here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-59384 - Qfiling</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59384</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 16:17:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-59384

Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.A possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of RFC 1883, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.The most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion – a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.As billions of devices and people came online, first using PCs and then wielding smartphones, conventional wisdom assumed that network operators would move to IPv6 rather than persist with IPv4.To understand why, know that IPv6 also suggested other, rather modest, changes to the way networks operate."IPv6 was an extremely conservative protocol that changed as little as possible," APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston told . "It was a classic case of mis-design by committee."And that notional committee made one more critical choice: IPv6 was not backward-compatible with IPv4, meaning users had to choose one or the other – or decide to run both in parallel.For many, the decision of which protocol to use was easy because IPv6 didn't add features that represented major improvements."One big surprise to me was how few features went into IPv6 in the end, aside from the massive expansion of address space," said Bruce Davie, a veteran computer scientist recently honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which lauded him for "fundamental contributions in networking systems through design, standardization, and commercialization of network protocols and systems."Davie said many of the security, plug-and-play, and quality of service features that didn't make it into IPv6 were eventually implemented in IPv4, further reducing the incentive to adopt the new protocol. "Given the small amount of new functionality in v6, it's not so surprising that deployment has been a 30 year struggle," he said.Another innovation that meant IPv6 made less sense was network address translation (NAT), which allows many devices to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT meant IPv4 network operators could connect thousands of devices with a single IP address, meaning their existing IP addresses became more useful."These solutions were relatively easy to deploy, aligned with existing expertise, and avoided large-scale infrastructure changes," said Alvaro Vives, manager of the learning and development team at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for 76 nations across Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.Because NAT stalled IPv6 adoption, vendors didn't rally behind the new protocol."Migration costs, complexity, and training requirements remain high, while short-term ROI is low," Gartner distinguished VP analyst Andrew Lerner told . "Performance parity across applications and devices is inconsistent, and some organizations even disable IPv6 for better performance. Lack of dual-stack support in legacy infrastructure is another barrier," he added.While IPv6 didn't take off as expected, it's not fair to say it failed."IPv6 wasn't about turning IPv4 off, but about ensuring the internet could continue to grow without breaking," said John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN)."In fact, IPv4's continued viability is largely because IPv6 absorbed that growth pressure elsewhere – particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments," he added. "In that sense, IPv6 succeeded where it was needed most, and must be regarded as a success."RIPE NCC's Alvaro Vives agrees. "What IPv6 got right was its long-term design," he told . "It provides a vast address space that allows networks to be planned more simply and consistently. This has enabled innovation, from large mobile networks to the Internet of Things and advanced routing techniques such as Segment Routing over IPv6."Gartner's Lerner thinks the time has come for organizations to develop detailed IPv6 migration plans."Validate application compatibility, and ensure new infrastructure supports IPv6," he advised. "Pilot deployments and lab testing with DNS64/NAT64 are recommended. Over time, IPv6 adoption will accelerate as private IPv4 space depletes and cloud providers introduce pricing models that favor IPv6."APNIC's Huston, however, thinks that IPv6 has become less relevant to the wider internet."I would argue that we actually found a far better outcome along the way," he told . "NATS forced us to think about network architectures in an entirely different way."That new way is encapsulated in a new technology called Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), that doesn't require client devices to always have access to a public IP address."We are proving to ourselves that clients don't need permanent assignment of IP address, which makes the client side of network far cheaper, more flexible, and scalable," he said.Huston thinks IPv6 has also become less relevant to servers."These days the Domain Name Service (DNS) is the service selector, not the IP address," Huston told . "The entire security framework of today's Internet is name based and the world of authentication and channel encryption is based on service names, not IP addresses.""So folk use IPv6 these days based on cost: If the cost of obtaining more IPv4 addresses to fuel bigger NATs is too high, then they deploy IPv6. Not because it's better, but if they are confident that they can work around IPv6's weaknesses then in a largely name based world there is no real issue in using one addressing protocol or another as the transport underlay."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 14:20:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The story you are reading is a series of scoops nestled inside a far more urgent Internet-wide security advisory. The vulnerability at issue has been exploited for months already, and it’s time for a broader awareness of the threat. The short version is that everything you thought you knew about the security of the internal network behind your Internet router probably is now dangerously out of date.The security company Synthient currently sees more than 2 million infected Kimwolf devices distributed globally but with concentrations in Vietnam, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States. Synthient found that two-thirds of the Kimwolf infections are Android TV boxes with no security or authentication built in.The past few months have witnessed the explosive growth of a new botnet dubbed , which experts say has infected more than 2 million devices globally. The Kimwolf malware forces compromised systems to relay malicious and abusive Internet traffic — such as ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping — and participate in crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks capable of knocking nearly any website offline for days at a time.More important than Kimwolf’s staggering size, however, is the diabolical method it uses to spread so quickly: By effectively tunneling back through various “residential proxy” networks and into the local networks of the proxy endpoints, and by further infecting devices that are hidden behind the assumed protection of the user’s firewall and Internet router.Residential proxy networks are sold as a way for customers to anonymize and localize their Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their traffic through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.The malware that turns an end-user’s Internet connection into a proxy node is often bundled with dodgy mobile apps and games. These residential proxy programs also are commonly installed via unofficial Android TV boxes sold by third-party merchants on popular e-commerce sites like , , and .These TV boxes range in price from $40 to $400, are marketed under a dizzying range of no-name brands and model numbers, and frequently are advertised as a way to stream certain types of subscription video content for free. But there’s a hidden cost to this transaction: As we’ll explore in a moment, these TV boxes make up a considerable chunk of the estimated two million systems currently infected with Kimwolf.Some of the unsanctioned Android TV boxes that come with residential proxy malware pre-installed. Image: Synthient.Kimwolf also is quite good at infecting a range of Internet-connected digital photo frames that likewise are abundant at major e-commerce websites. In November 2025, researchers from  published a report (PDF) detailing serious security issues in Android-based digital picture frames running the including Amazon’s bestselling digital frame as of March 2025.There are two major security problems with these photo frames and unofficial Android TV boxes. The first is that a considerable percentage of them come with malware pre-installed, or else require the user to download an unofficial Android App Store and malware in order to use the device for its stated purpose (video content piracy). The most typical of these uninvited guests are small programs that turn the device into a residential proxy node that is resold to others.The second big security nightmare with these photo frames and unsanctioned Android TV boxes is that they rely on a handful of Internet-connected microcomputer boards that have no discernible security or authentication requirements built-in. In other words, if you are on the same network as one or more of these devices, you can likely compromise them simultaneously by issuing a single command across the network.THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE 127.0.0.1The combination of these two security realities came to the fore in October 2025, when an undergraduate computer science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology began closely tracking Kimwolf’s growth, and interacting directly with its apparent creators on a daily basis.is the 22-year-old founder of the security firm , a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks and learn how those networks are being abused. Conducting much of his research into Kimwolf while studying for final exams, Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in late October 2025 he suspected Kimwolf was a new Android-based variant of , a botnet that was incorrectly blamed for a number of record-smashing DDoS attacks last fall.Brundage says Kimwolf grew rapidly by abusing a glaring vulnerability in many of the world’s largest residential proxy services. The crux of the weakness, he explained, was that these proxy services weren’t doing enough to prevent their customers from forwarding requests to internal servers of the individual proxy endpoints.Most proxy services take basic steps to prevent their paying customers from “going upstream” into the local network of proxy endpoints, by explicitly denying requests for local addresses specified in RFC-1918, including the well-known Network Address Translation (NAT) ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, and 172.16.0.0/12. These ranges allow multiple devices in a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address, and if you run any kind of home or office network, your internal address space operates within one or more of these NAT ranges.However, Brundage discovered that the people operating Kimwolf had figured out how to talk directly to devices on the internal networks of millions of residential proxy endpoints, simply by changing their  (DNS) settings to match those in the RFC-1918 address ranges.“It is possible to circumvent existing domain restrictions by using DNS records that point to 192.168.0.1 or 0.0.0.0,” Brundage wrote in a first-of-its-kind security advisory sent to nearly a dozen residential proxy providers in mid-December 2025. “This grants an attacker the ability to send carefully crafted requests to the current device or a device on the local network. This is actively being exploited, with attackers leveraging this functionality to drop malware.”As with the digital photo frames mentioned above, many of these residential proxy services run solely on mobile devices that are running some game, VPN or other app with a hidden component that turns the user’s mobile phone into a residential proxy — often without any meaningful consent.In a report published today, Synthient said key actors involved in Kimwolf were observed monetizing the botnet through app installs, selling residential proxy bandwidth, and selling its DDoS functionality.“Synthient expects to observe a growing interest among threat actors in gaining unrestricted access to proxy networks to infect devices, obtain network access, or access sensitive information,” the report observed. “Kimwolf highlights the risks posed by unsecured proxy networks and their viability as an attack vector.”After purchasing a number of unofficial Android TV box models that were most heavily represented in the Kimwolf botnet, Brundage further discovered the proxy service vulnerability was only part of the reason for Kimwolf’s rapid rise: He also found virtually all of the devices he tested were shipped from the factory with a powerful feature called  (ADB) mode enabled by default.Many of the unofficial Android TV boxes infected by Kimwolf include the ominous disclaimer: “Made in China. Overseas use only.” Image: Synthient.ADB is a diagnostic tool intended for use solely during the manufacturing and testing processes, because it allows the devices to be remotely configured and even updated with new (and potentially malicious) firmware. However, shipping these devices with ADB turned on creates a security nightmare because in this state they constantly listen for and accept unauthenticated connection requests.For example, opening a command prompt and typing “adb connect” along with a vulnerable device’s (local) IP address followed immediately by “:5555” will very quickly offer unrestricted “super user” administrative access.Brundage said by early December, he’d identified a one-to-one overlap between new Kimwolf infections and proxy IP addresses offered for rent by China-based , currently the world’s largest residential proxy network by all accounts.“Kimwolf has almost doubled in size this past week, just by exploiting IPIDEA’s proxy pool,” Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in early December as he was preparing to notify IPIDEA and 10 other proxy providers about his research.Brundage said Synthient first confirmed on December 1, 2025 that the Kimwolf botnet operators were tunneling back through IPIDEA’s proxy network and into the local networks of systems running IPIDEA’s proxy software. The attackers dropped the malware payload by directing infected systems to visit a specific Internet address and to call out the pass phrase “” in order to unlock the malicious download.On December 30, Synthient said it was tracking roughly 2 million IPIDEA addresses exploited by Kimwolf in the previous week. Brundage said he has witnessed Kimwolf rebuilding itself after one recent takedown effort targeting its control servers — from almost nothing to two million infected systems just by tunneling through proxy endpoints on IPIDEA for a couple of days.Brundage said IPIDEA has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new proxies, advertising access to more than 100 million residential proxy endpoints around the globe in the past week alone. Analyzing the exposed devices that were part of IPIDEA’s proxy pool, Synthient said it found more than two-thirds were Android devices that could be compromised with no authentication needed.SECURITY NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSEAfter charting a tight overlap in Kimwolf-infected IP addresses and those sold by IPIDEA, Brundage was eager to make his findings public: The vulnerability had clearly been exploited for several months, although it appeared that only a handful of cybercrime actors were aware of the capability. But he also knew that going public without giving vulnerable proxy providers an opportunity to understand and patch it would only lead to more mass abuse of these services by additional cybercriminal groups.On December 17, Brundage sent a security notification to all 11 of the apparently affected proxy providers, hoping to give each at least a few weeks to acknowledge and address the core problems identified in his report before he went public. Many proxy providers who received the notification were resellers of IPIDEA that white-labeled the company’s service.KrebsOnSecurity first sought comment from IPIDEA in October 2025, in reporting on a story about how the proxy network appeared to have benefitted from the rise of the Aisuru botnet, whose administrators appeared to shift from using the botnet primarily for DDoS attacks to simply installing IPIDEA’s proxy program, among others.On December 25, KrebsOnSecurity received an email from an IPIDEA employee identified only as “,” who said allegations that IPIDEA had benefitted from Aisuru’s rise were baseless.“After comprehensively verifying IP traceability records and supplier cooperation agreements, we found no association between any of our IP resources and the Aisuru botnet, nor have we received any notifications from authoritative institutions regarding our IPs being involved in malicious activities,” Oliver wrote. “In addition, for external cooperation, we implement a three-level review mechanism for suppliers, covering qualification verification, resource legality authentication and continuous dynamic monitoring, to ensure no compliance risks throughout the entire cooperation process.”“IPIDEA firmly opposes all forms of unfair competition and malicious smearing in the industry, always participates in market competition with compliant operation and honest cooperation, and also calls on the entire industry to jointly abandon irregular and unethical behaviors and build a clean and fair market ecosystem,” Oliver continued.Meanwhile, the same day that Oliver’s email arrived, Brundage shared a response he’d just received from IPIDEA’s security officer, who identified himself only by the first name . The security officer said IPIDEA had made a number of important security changes to its residential proxy service to address the vulnerability identified in Brundage’s report.“By design, the proxy service does not allow access to any internal or local address space,” Byron explained. “This issue was traced to a legacy module used solely for testing and debugging purposes, which did not fully inherit the internal network access restrictions. Under specific conditions, this module could be abused to reach internal resources. The affected paths have now been fully blocked and the module has been taken offline.”Byron told Brundage IPIDEA also instituted multiple mitigations for blocking DNS resolution to internal (NAT) IP ranges, and that it was now blocking proxy endpoints from forwarding traffic on “high-risk” ports “to prevent abuse of the service for scanning, lateral movement, or access to internal services.”An excerpt from an email sent by IPIDEA’s security officer in response to Brundage’s vulnerability notification. Click to enlarge.Brundage said IPIDEA appears to have successfully patched the vulnerabilities he identified. He also noted he never observed the Kimwolf actors targeting proxy services other than IPIDEA, which has not responded to requests for comment. is founder of Spur.us, a technology firm that helps companies identify and filter out proxy traffic. Kilmer said Spur has tested Brundage’s findings and confirmed that IPIDEA and all of its affiliate resellers indeed allowed full and unfiltered access to the local LAN.“And since Superbox turns the IP into an IPIDEA proxy, a bad actor just has to use the proxy to localhost on that port and install whatever bad SDKs [software development kits] they want,” Kilmer told KrebsOnSecurity.Superbox media streaming boxes for sale on Walmart.com.Both Brundage and Kilmer say IPIDEA appears to be the second or third reincarnation of a residential proxy network formerly known as , a service that operated between 2014 and 2022 and was wildly popular on cybercrime forums. 911S5 Proxy imploded a week after KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the service’s sketchy origins and leadership in China.In that 2022 profile, we cited work by researchers at the  in Canada who were studying the threat 911S5 could pose to internal corporate networks. The researchers noted that “the infection of a node enables the 911S5 user to access shared resources on the network such as local intranet portals or other services.”“It also enables the end user to probe the LAN network of the infected node,” the researchers explained. “Using the internal router, it would be possible to poison the DNS cache of the LAN router of the infected node, enabling further attacks.”911S5 initially responded to our reporting in 2022 by claiming it was conducting a top-down security review of the service. But the proxy service abruptly closed up shop just one week later, saying a malicious hacker had destroyed all of the company’s customer and payment records. In July 2024, The U.S. Department of the Treasurysanctioned the alleged creators of 911S5, and the U.S. Department of Justice arrested the Chinese national named in my 2022 profile of the proxy service.Kilmer said IPIDEA also operates a sister service called , which the company has pitched from Day One as a seamless alternative to 911S5 Proxy.“You cannot tell me they don’t want the 911 customers by calling it that,” Kilmer said.Among the recipients of Synthient’s notification was the proxy giant . Brundage shared an email he received from Oxylabs’ security team on December 31, which acknowledged Oxylabs had started rolling out security modifications to address the vulnerabilities described in Synthient’s report.Reached for comment, Oxylabs confirmed they “have implemented changes that now eliminate the ability to bypass the blocklist and forward requests to private network addresses using a controlled domain.” But it said there is no evidence that Kimwolf or other other attackers exploited its network.“In parallel, we reviewed the domains identified in the reported exploitation activity and did not observe traffic associated with them,” the Oxylabs statement continued. “Based on this review, there is no indication that our residential network was impacted by these activities.”Consider the following scenario, in which the mere act of allowing someone to use your Wi-Fi network could lead to a Kimwolf botnet infection. In this example, a friend or family member comes to stay with you for a few days, and you grant them access to your Wi-Fi without knowing that their mobile phone is infected with an app that turns the device into a residential proxy node. At that point, your home’s public IP address will show up for rent at the website of some residential proxy provider.Miscreants like those behind Kimwolf then use residential proxy services online to access that proxy node on your IP, tunnel back through it and into your local area network (LAN), and automatically scan the internal network for devices with Android Debug Bridge mode turned on.By the time your guest has packed up their things, said their goodbyes and disconnected from your Wi-Fi, you now have two devices on your local network — a digital photo frame and an unsanctioned Android TV box — that are infected with Kimwolf. You may have never intended for these devices to be exposed to the larger Internet, and yet there you are.Here’s another possible nightmare scenario: Attackers use their access to proxy networks to modify your Internet router’s settings so that it relies on malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers — allowing them to control where your Web browser goes when it requests a website. Think that’s far-fetched? Recall the DNSChanger malware from 2012 that infected more than a half-million routers with search-hijacking malware, and ultimately spawned an entire security industry working group focused on containing and eradicating it.Much of what is published so far on Kimwolf has come from the Chinese security firm , which was the first to chronicle the rise of the Aisuru botnet in late 2024. In its latest blog post, XLab said it began tracking Kimwolf on October 24, when the botnet’s control servers were swamping Cloudflare’s DNS servers with lookups for the distinctive domain 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su.This domain and others connected to early Kimwolf variants spent several weeks topping Cloudflare’s chart of the Internet’s most sought-after domains, edging out Google.com and Apple.com of their rightful spots in the top 5 most-requested domains. That’s because during that time Kimwolf was asking its millions of bots to check in frequently using Cloudflare’s DNS servers.The Chinese security firm XLab found the Kimwolf botnet had enslaved between 1.8 and 2 million devices, with heavy concentrations in Brazil, India, The United States of America and Argentina. Image: blog.xLab.qianxin.comIt is clear from reading the XLab report that KrebsOnSecurity (and security experts) probably erred in misattributing some of Kimwolf’s early activities to the Aisuru botnet, which appears to be operated by a different group entirely. IPDEA may have been truthful when it said it had no affiliation with the Aisuru botnet, but Brundage’s data left no doubt that its proxy service clearly was being massively abused by Aisuru’s Android variant, Kimwolf.XLab said Kimwolf has infected at least 1.8 million devices, and has shown it is able to rebuild itself quickly from scratch.“Analysis indicates that Kimwolf’s primary infection targets are TV boxes deployed in residential network environments,” XLab researchers wrote. “Since residential networks usually adopt dynamic IP allocation mechanisms, the public IPs of devices change over time, so the true scale of infected devices cannot be accurately measured solely by the quantity of IPs. In other words, the cumulative observation of 2.7 million IP addresses does not equate to 2.7 million infected devices.”XLab said measuring Kimwolf’s size also is difficult because infected devices are distributed across multiple global time zones. “Affected by time zone differences and usage habits (e.g., turning off devices at night, not using TV boxes during holidays, etc.), these devices are not online simultaneously, further increasing the difficulty of comprehensive observation through a single time window,” the blog post observed.XLab noted that the Kimwolf author shows an almost ‘obsessive’ fixation” on Yours Truly, apparently leaving “easter eggs” related to my name in multiple places through the botnet’s code and communications:One frustrating aspect of threats like Kimwolf is that in most cases it is not easy for the average user to determine if there are any devices on their internal network which may be vulnerable to threats like Kimwolf and/or already infected with residential proxy malware.Let’s assume that through years of security training or some dark magic you can successfully identify that residential proxy activity on your internal network was linked to a specific mobile device inside your house: From there, you’d still need to isolate and remove the app or unwanted component that is turning the device into a residential proxy.Also, the tooling and knowledge needed to achieve this kind of visibility just isn’t there from an average consumer standpoint. The work that it takes to configure your network so you can see and interpret logs of all traffic coming in and out is largely beyond the skillset of most Internet users (and, I’d wager, many security experts). But it’s a topic worth exploring in an upcoming story.If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story and explain that it’s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.The top 15 product devices represented in the Kimwolf botnet, according to Synthient. is a principal security researcher with . Seaman said he wants more consumers to be wary of these pseudo Android TV boxes to the point where they avoid them altogether.“I want the consumer to be paranoid of these crappy devices and of these residential proxy schemes,” he said. “We need to highlight why they’re dangerous to everyone and to the individual. The whole security model where people think their LAN (Local Internal Network) is safe, that there aren’t any bad guys on the LAN so it can’t be that dangerous is just really outdated now.”“The idea that an app can enable this type of abuse on my network and other networks, that should really give you pause,” about which devices to allow onto your local network, Seaman said. “And it’s not just Android devices here. Some of these proxy services have SDKs for Mac and Windows, and the iPhone. It could be running something that inadvertently cracks open your network and lets countless random people inside.”In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants collectively dubbed the “,” which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors — usually during the set-up process.The FBI said BADBOX 2.0 was discovered after the original BADBOX campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original BADBOX was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase. is vice president of threat intelligence at , a company that worked closely on the BADBOX investigations. Kaye said the BADBOX botnets and the residential proxy networks that rode on top of compromised devices were detected because they enabled a ridiculous amount of advertising fraud, as well as ticket scalping, retail fraud, account takeovers and content scraping.Kaye said consumers should stick to known brands when it comes to purchasing things that require a wired or wireless connection.“If people are asking what they can do to avoid being victimized by proxies, it’s safest to stick with name brands,” Kaye said. “Anything promising something for free or low-cost, or giving you something for nothing just isn’t worth it. And be careful about what apps you allow on your phone.”Many wireless routers these days make it relatively easy to deploy a “Guest” wireless network on-the-fly. Doing so allows your guests to browse the Internet just fine but it blocks their device from being able to talk to other devices on the local network — such as shared folders, printers and drives. If someone — a friend, family member, or contractor — requests access to your network, give them the guest Wi-Fi network credentials if you have that option.There is a small but vocal pro-piracy camp that is almost condescendingly dismissive of the security threats posed by these unsanctioned Android TV boxes. These tech purists positively chafe at the idea of people wholesale discarding one of these TV boxes. A common refrain from this camp is that Internet-connected devices are not inherently bad or good, and that even factory-infected boxes can be flashed with new firmware or custom ROMs that contain no known dodgy software.However, it’s important to point out that the majority of people buying these devices are not security or hardware experts; the devices are sought out because they dangle something of value for “free.” Most buyers have no idea of the bargain they’re making when plugging one of these dodgy TV boxes into their network.It is somewhat remarkable that we haven’t yet seen the entertainment industry applying more visible pressure on the major e-commerce vendors to stop peddling this insecure and actively malicious hardware that is largely made and marketed for video piracy. These TV boxes are a public nuisance for bundling malicious software while having no apparent security or authentication built-in, and these two qualities make them an attractive nuisance for cybercriminals.Stay tuned for Part II in this series, which will poke through clues left behind by the people who appear to have built Kimwolf and benefited from it the most.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trust Wallet links $8.5 million crypto theft to Shai-Hulud NPM attack</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trust-wallet-links-85-million-crypto-theft-to-shai-hulud-npm-attack/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 14:19:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trust Wallet believes the compromise of its web browser to steal roughly $8.5 million from over 2,500 crypto wallets is likely related to an "industry-wide" Sha1-Hulud attack in November.

Ryan Goldberg and Kevin Martin admitted to conspiring to extort U.S. organizations, abusing the same security expertise they once used to defend cyber victims. Working with a third accomplice, they breached multiple companies nationwide and shared roughly 20% of ransom proceeds for access to BlackCat’s infrastructure. Prosecutors say they demanded between $300,000 and $10 million per victim.Alternative to insider risk at the highest technical levels, similar threats are emerging from much lower in the access chain, too. Indian , a popular cryptoexchange with more arrests are expected. The incident exposed data from roughly 69,500 users after bribed staff at outsourcing partner, TaskUs, enabled access. This news follows charges against Ronald Spektor, accused of stealing $16 million by impersonating Coinbase, highlighting ongoing insider and social engineering risks.Beyond insider abuse, attackers are also exploiting everyday user behavior to siphon funds at massive scale. A , an illegal Windows and Office software activator. The suspect used clipper malware to swap cryptocurrency addresses and divert funds to attacker-controlled ones. Korean National Police Agency says the campaign ran from 2020 to 2023, with a total of KRW 1.7 billion ($1.2M) stolen across thousands of transactions. Authorities warn that pirated software is often a key component in how attackers spread malware.The Bad | Chinese-Based Attackers Deploy Stealthy Kernel‑Mode ‘ToneShell’ BackdoorSecurity researchers have uncovered , now delivered via a kernel‑mode loader for the first time. New analysis links the campaign to G0129 (Bronze President, TEMP.Hex, Hive0154), a threat actor known for targeting government agencies, NGOs, and think tanks.The activity, observed since at least February, primarily targets government organizations across Asia, particularly in Myanmar and Thailand. Investigators have found evidence that some victims had previously been compromised by earlier ToneShell variants, PlugX malware, or the ToneDisk USB worm, indicating long‑term persistence across multiple intrusion waves.What sets this campaign apart is its use of a malicious kernel‑mode mini‑filter driver, , signed with a stolen or leaked digital certificate originally issued to Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd and valid between 2012 to 2015. Operating deep within the Windows kernel,  by manipulating the WdFilter driver’s load order.The driver ultimately injects two user‑mode payloads, including the updated ToneShell backdoor, which now features enhanced stealth capabilities. Changes also include a simplified host‑ID scheme, network traffic obfuscation using fake TLS headers, and remote administration capabilities such as file transfer and interactive shell access. Communication occurs over TCP port 443 to an attacker‑controlled infrastructure.Researchers note this marks a clear evolution in G0129’s tactics, prioritizing kernel‑level persistence and evasion. As the payload operates almost entirely in memory, memory forensics becomes a critical detection method, alongside monitoring for indicators of compromise tied to the malicious driver and injected shellcode.The Ugly | Hackers Steal $7M via Compromised Trust Wallet Chrome ExtensionAfter a compromised update to the .

Users immediately reported funds disappearing after simple wallet authorizations, prompting Trust Wallet to investigate and release a patched version 2.69. CEO Eowyn Chen confirmed the hack and assured users that the company would reimburse affected wallets.Investigations indicate that attackers likely exploited a leaked Chrome Web Store API key to publish the malicious extension, bypassing Trust Wallet’s standard release procedures. In parallel, threat actors launched a phishing campaign using a Trust Wallet-branded site, , claiming to provide a “vulnerability fix”. Users who entered their seed phrases on the site immediately lost access to their wallets. WHOIS records suggest the phishing domain may be linked to the same actors behind the malicious extension.Trust Wallet, a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet acquired by Binance in 2018, emphasized that mobile-only users and other browser extension versions were not affected. The company has begun reimbursing victims after verifying wallet ownership, transaction hashes, and affected addresses, while warning users not to share private keys or seed phrases.Security researchers noted the incident highlights . Trust Wallet has suspended compromised API keys, reported the malicious domains to registrars, and continues monitoring for scams.

      A few days ago, I found that a grown man had been texting my twelve-year-old 
      son on his "kid-safe" Gabb phone. The man got my son's number through a 
      children's book chat on an app called GroupMe. Thankfully my wife and I 
      discovered the situation and intervened before anything bad happened; but 
      still it was sickening to discover that on Christmas morning, while our 
      family was unwrapping presents next to the tree, some creep had been texting 
      my son: "What did you get? Send pictures."
    
      How could we have let this happen? How could we be such careless parents?
    
      But wait . . . hadn't we done what we were supposed to do? We bought the 
      "kid-safe" phone. And we confirmed GroupMe was on the 
      Gabb "approved apps" list, which, 
      as I understand it, offers "no social media or high-risk options." We 
      did the safe things, right?
    
      Maybe not. Turns out Gabb's own blog appears to include GroupMe on a list of 
      seven apps with 
        dangerous chat features, describing it as an app that "opens the 
        door to potential dangers." We were apparently supposed to find that 
        warning ourselves, somewhere among Gabb's 572 blog posts:
    $ curl -s \
  https://gabb.com/post-sitemap.xml \
  | grep -oE 'https://gabb\.com/blog/[^<]+' \
  | sort -u \
  | wc -l \
  | xargs -I{} echo "{} blog posts as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

572 blog posts as of January 02, 2026
      But if GroupMe "opens the door" to danger, why did Gabb put it on their "approved 
      apps" list? When I revisited the site, I noticed a small message beneath 
      GroupMe mentioning Communication with Strangers. I hovered over it with 
      my mouse pointer, and a tooltip appeared: "Allows contact and communication with 
      people the child may not know."
    
      So it allows communication with strangers, but it's not "high-risk?" The 
      approved list isn't looking so safe. The approved list is apparently a 
      catalog of risks I'm supposed to decipher by filtering through 838 apps 
      and hovering my mouse pointer around to see tooltips:
    $ for cat in \
  existing_apps \
  unapproved_apps \
  unmet_criteria_apps \
  music_apps; do
  count=$(curl -s "https://gabb.com/app-guide/" \
    | grep -o "${cat} = \[.*\]" \
    | head -1 \
    | sed "s/${cat} = \[//" \
    | sed "s/\]//" \
    | tr ',' '\n' \
    | sed "s/'//g" \
    | sed 's/^ *//' \
    | sort -u \
    | wc -l \
    | tr -d ' ')
  echo "$count $cat"
done && echo "...as of $(date '+%B %d, %Y')"

586 existing_apps
60 unapproved_apps
170 unmet_criteria_apps
22 music_apps
...as of January 02, 2026
      Whatever the reason for this complexity, I don't feel in control.
    
      And Gabb isn't alone in making me feel like this. It seems like many companies 
      selling tech to families operate in the same way: market safety, deliver 
      complexity, and leave parents to figure it out.
    
      Take the Nintendo Switch my son unwrapped between those creepy texts. To 
      set it up, I had to:
    Connect the console to the internetDownload the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app to my phoneCreate a Nintendo Account for myselfLink my credit card and be charged $0.50 to verify parental consentSet up parental controls from the app on my phoneSync the parental controls app to the Nintendo SwitchSet up a security PIN on the Nintendo SwitchCreate a Nintendo Account for my sonSync my son's Nintendo Account to the Nintendo SwitchDiscover that half the controls live in the phone app and the other 
        half live on Nintendo's website, because of course they doLog into Nintendo's website to finish the job . . . 
      Only to discover that there's no clear option to block internet access, 
      no clear way to disable downloads from the Nintendo eShop, and no easy 
      way to make this thing function like an old-school Game Boy and just let a 
      kid have fun with a game cartridge. But that's just nostalgia talking. 
      Nobody wants that anymore. Apparently.
    
      Because next comes Minecraft. Ah, Minecraft. The game every middle-schooler 
      on earth apparently needs to survive. To let my son play with his friends:
    Create a Microsoft account for myselfCreate an email address for my sonCreate a Microsoft account for my sonSet up a gamertag for my son on account.xbox.comConfigure parental controls in Microsoft Family SafetyConfigure more parental controls on xbox.com
      Now, I did my best to configure these settings. I really did. But xbox.com alone
      includes twenty-nine confusingly overlapping settings related to chat, 
      friends, and communication. Twenty-nine.
    
      And when I finally——tried to test online play, Minecraft 
      told me I would need to loosen the parental controls (it did not say 
      which)  create a Nintendo Switch Online account for my son.
    
      Nintendo Switch Online (not really another account, mind you, but a 
      ) involves a recurring fee. It also unlocks access to 
      the Nintendo eShop, which I cannot disable. I can set his eShop spending limit 
      to zero, sure. But I can't block free downloads. So to let my son play 
      online Minecraft with his friends, I have to open him up to an unrelated store full of content 
      I can't possibly evaluate. That's the deal. Take it or leave it.
    
      I assume some marketing person at Nintendo, probably sitting in a 
      conference room in Kyoto, surrounded by whiteboards covered in arrows and 
      cartoon stick figures, has this entire process mapped out as a "customer 
      journey." And by Step 17, the journey is supposed to be over. You're 
      supposed to be so beaten down, so utterly depleted of will, that you just 
      cave. You sign up for Nintendo Online. You disable a bunch of parental 
      controls you don't really understand. You let your kid play his damn game. 
      You become the ideal customer.
    
      But I didn't cave. Instead, somewhere on the threshold of Customer Journey Step 18, 
      I found myself gripping the Switch with both hands and imagining, quite 
      vividly, what it would feel like to lift the Switch up, and bring it down
      over my knee. I could almost hear the crack. Could almost see that OLED
      display splintering into a thousand pieces. The little Joy-Cons skittering
      across the floor. My son's face. My wife's face. The stunned silence.
    
      I did not break the Switch.
    
      What I did was announce, in a voice louder than 
      necessary, that  was to ask me about anything 
      Minecraft-related on the Nintendo Switch for a minimum of two weeks. My 
      son could play Zelda: Breath of the Wild instead, which, thank you, 
      developers, thank you from the bottom of my heart, doesn't appear to 
      involve any mandatory online anything whatsoever.
    
      Here's what I want: an off switch. A single setting that says "this 
      child cannot go online, communicate with strangers, spend money, or 
      download anything without my explicit permission." Instead I get a 
      maze, complex enough that when something goes wrong, I'm at fault for a
      tooltip I didn't hover over, a blog post I didn't read, a submenu I didn't 
      find. Maybe that's by design. Maybe it's neglect. I don't know.
    
      What I know is this. My son just wants to play video games and talk to his
      friends. I just want to keep him safe. Somewhere between those 
      two things, I'm supposed to become an expert in the convoluted parental 
      control schemes of Gabb, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Xbox, while a stranger's 
      Christmas morning texts sit in my son's phone history.
    
      Parental controls shouldn't be this hard.

Run keys, shell extensions, COM hijacks: the patterns are well documented and the detection coverage reflects this.This post explores a technique for establishing registry persistence and registry writes against HKCU at medium integrity without triggering registry callbacks.EDR solutions monitor registry modifications through . This kernel callback mechanism allows drivers to intercept registry operations before they complete. When a process calls  or , registered callbacks receive notification with full context: the key path, the data being written, and the process responsible.Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard) prevents vendors from hooking the kernel directly.  provides a supported alternative, and most endpoint security products rely on it for registry visibility.Elastic's Uncommon Registry Persistence Change rule is representative. It monitors registry paths including:These paths represent classic persistence locations. The detection logic filters out known legitimate modifications and alerts on the rest.The approach works because registry writes go through the registry APIs, which trigger the callbacks, which generate telemetry. Every step in this chain is well instrumented.The chain assumes registry writes use the registry APIs.Windows user profiles store registry hives in the user's profile directory.  contains the user's  hive and gets loaded at logon.  takes priority when present.The  extension denotes a . Originally designed for kiosk and shared workstation scenarios, Windows checks for this file first and loads it instead of the standard  hive. Microsoft's documentation describes the intended use case:A mandatory user profile is a roaming user profile that has been preconfigured by an administrator to specify settings for users.The Active Directory Migration Tool (ADMT) provides an example of this priority handling. When translating user profiles during domain migrations, ADMT must locate the correct hive file. The source code shows the priority logic:When  exists, Windows does not merge it with . The  file becomes the entire HKCU hive for that session.Placing a crafted  in  loads persistence keys into HKCU on next logon. The hive is loaded directly from disk without invoking registry APIs. monitors registry operations. Hive loads are not registry operations. The callbacks are not invoked.Filesystem events will trigger. Writing the file to the profile directory is visible to any EDR monitoring file operations. Registry-focused detections remain blind.Medium integrity is sufficient. The target is the user's own profile directory, which they have write access to. Local admin is not required.The profile subsystem loads , not alongside it. The target user's existing hive is required as a starting point, with persistence keys added to it. Enterprise environments configure application settings, shell preferences, environment variables, and policy state through the registry. Replacing the hive wholesale results in a visibly broken session.The registry can be exported in two formats: binary (the raw hive) or  (text format). Binary export requires elevation. Text export does not.The general recommended workflow, while you can drop an arbitrary hive on disk, is as follows:Export the target user's HKCU hive as  format (BOFs exist for this)Add persistence entries to the  fileConvert to binary hive format using tooling such as HiveSwarmingWrite the modified hive as  in the target's  directoryOn next login, Windows loads the hive from  with your additional registry keys now present in HKCU - without registry API calls.User hives remain locked while the session is active; Windows holds a handle on the loaded hive, preventing modification or replacement. cannot be swapped while the target user is logged in. Activation requires logoff and logon, or a system reboot. This makes it a persistence mechanism rather than immediate execution.Operating as a different user or SYSTEM allows staging the file in the target's profile directory, but the hive will not load until their next session starts. Removal works the same way: log in as a different user so the hive is not locked.Mandatory profiles can be assigned via Active Directory. The profile path attribute on a user object points to a network share:This opens two possible avenues:1. Modify the profile path. With write access to the target user's AD object, point their profile path to a share you control containing a crafted .On next logon, Windows fetches the hive from your share. This requires Write Property on the  attribute - typically granted through delegated OU administration or membership in Account Operators.However, without access to their current hive, crafting a functional  is difficult. We advise against this approach.2. Write to an existing profile share. Roaming profile shares with weak permissions allow direct placement of  following the earlier workflow. The target user's next logon loads your hive instead of their existing profile.The roaming profile case has an additional consideration. Microsoft's documentation notes that when the profile server is unavailable, Windows falls back to a locally cached copy if one exists. A target who normally works on-premise but occasionally connects remotely may load your hive only when on the corporate network.The only indicator for local persistence is the file write. Registry telemetry shows nothing because the registry APIs were not called.File writes to  in any profile directoryFile writes to  on roaming profile sharesExistence of  files outside expected mandatory profile deploymentsModifications to the  attribute on AD user objectsHive load events correlating with unexpected  filesMandatory profiles are rare in modern environments. Outside of kiosk or shared workstation configurations, their presence warrants investigation.Credit to Windows security researcher Jonas L for highlighting this "intended functionality".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FracturedJson</title><link>https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki</link><author>PretzelFisch</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 12:46:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Assorted less(1) tips</title><link>https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 12:29:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Operating on multiple files
While most folks invoke

at the tail of a pipeline like
Invoking  in a pipeline

you can directly provide one or more files to open

 less Adding files after starting
When reading a document,
sometimes you want to view another file,
adding it to the file list.
Perhaps while reading some C source code
you want to also look over the corresponding header-file.
You can add that header-file to the argument list with
Navigating multiple files
You can navigate between multiple files using

to go to the next file in the argument-list, and

for the previous file.
You can also use

to rewind to the first file in the argument-list
similar to how

behaves in
/.
Removing files after starting
While I rarely feel the need to,
if you have finished with a file
and want to keep your argument list clean,
you can use

to delete the current file from the argument-list.
Jumping to a particular line-number
Use

to jump to a particular line-number.
So using

will jump to line .
It helps to display
line numbers.
Jumping to a particular percentage-offset
Similarly, using

jumps to that percentage-offset of the file.
So if you want to go to ¾
of the way through the file, you can type

to jump right there.

While many folks know you can search forward with

and some people know you can use

to search backwards,
or use
/
to search again for the next/previous match,

provides modifiers you can specify
before the pattern to modify its behavior:

  Find the next line that
  
  match the pattern
 
 search across multiple files,
 starting from the current location
 in the current file
 
 rewind to the first file
 and search from there
 
 rewind to the first file
 and search from there
 across multiple files
 
Thus you would use

to search for "pattern"
starting with the first file.

Using

lets you specify a pattern
and filter the displayed lines
to only those matching the pattern,
much like an internal

command.
If you modify it with
,
so it will display only those lines that do

the pattern, like
.
I find this particularly helpful for browsing log-files.

You can bookmark points in a file with

followed by a letter,
then jump back to that bookmark with

followed by the same letter.
These apply globally across all open files,
so if you

in the third file,
then navigate away to other files,
using

will take you back to the marked location
in that third file.
I use marks most when reading man-pages,
dropping one mark at the

section such as
,
and another at the

section,
such as
,
then bounce back and forth between them with

and
.
While you can use any of
the 26 lowercase or uppercase letters
(for a total of 52 marks),
I rarely use more than two or three
either in alphabetical order
("a", "b", "c"),
or assigning mnemonics like in the
-page example above.

If the first line on the screen contains a
,
,
or
,
typing that character
will jump to the matching/closing character,
putting it on the bottom line of the screen.
Similarly, if a closing
,
,
or
,
character appears on the last line,
typing that closing character
will jump to the matching/opening character,
putting it at the top of the screen.
I find it a little disorienting
if they fall  than a screen-height apart
because what feels like a forward motion
to find the next matching close-bracket
might actually result in shifting the screen

rather than

which feels backwards.

While I don't use it much,
you can also specify match-pairs using

or

followed by the opening/closing pair of characters
such as

to define a "<"…">" pair
and jump between them
in a manner similar to the
/,
/,
and
/
motions.
Toggling options without restarting
While the
-page
documents many flags you can pass
on the command-line,
you can also toggle boolean options from inside
.
I find this particularly helpful
when I've fed the output of a long-running process to

and don't want to re-run it
because it will take a long time.
Instead of quitting,
you can type a literal

followed by the option you want to change.
I most commonly want to toggle word-wrap for long lines,
so instead of quitting and adding

at the end of my pipeline,
I can type

directly in
.
Options I commonly toggle:
word-wrap (mnemonic "splitting long lines")smart-case/case-sensitivity for searches
The

lets you invoke an external command.
I don't do this often,
but occasionally I want some simple reference
like the current date
()
or to do some simple math
().
Default options with 
You might find yourself regularly setting
a common group of
options
so you can put those in your environment
(usually in your shell startup file like
)
like

if you want to
show ANSI colors,
show line-numbers,
and exit automatically when you reach the end of the file.

has a few other corners that I've never really used,
but figured I'd document here:

While I've used tags in
/
to easily jump between definitions.
However, even though

provides support for tags generated by
.
I've never found cause to use them.
Editing the current document
The

command will open your

editor on the current document.

lets you redirect the output
it has gathered from

to a file using the

command
(or the

command to overwrite an existing file).
This might come in handy because

won't let you
edit stdin
in an external editor
but you can write it directly to a file.

We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy’s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia’s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past. Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down the bike path.

text files using Beancount. Since January 2016, I've taken out about 30-45 minutes every
single month to download my monthly bank statements and import them into my Beancount
ledger.There's a lot to talk about here, but let's start with some fun numbers!The 10 year old Beancount ledger10 years of financial transactions is a lot of data! All in all, my ledger contains over
45,000 lines of Beancount entries spread across 16 plain text files. All of it is stored
in a  directory (version controlled) on my laptop. Here's a snapshot:Running  on  tells me I have about 10,000 transactions in
total, that in turn contain about 20,000 postings (in double-entry bookkeeping, one
transaction may have multiple postings).There are 1086 accounts in total.... which does not mean that there are 1086  accounts. Accounts in Beancount are
virtual, and you can create as many as you like. Imagine one account for categorizing
supermarket spending, one for tracking your income, one for your Netflix subscription,
and so on.Next, there are about 500 documents in the repository.Beancount lets you attach documents (e.g. receipts or invoices) to transactions, that
makes bookkeeping very efficient. I love the fact that whenever I need to do my tax
returns, I can just take a look at my Beancount ledger and find all the invoices right
there next to the relevant transaction.Lastly, in terms of postings, I started out with 715 in the year 2016, and the year 2023
was the busiest so far in terms of just the total postings count.I wrote earlier that every month I take about 30-45 minutes to import my financial
transactions into Beancount. What does that workflow look like? I wrote another, much
more detailed blog post about it a few years ago, but here's a gist.It starts with me logging in to my bank account(s) to download my monthly statement(s)
in CSV (CSV because it's much more predictable to parse compared to PDF). I then run
these CSV files through what's called an "importer", that converts this CSV data into
data structures that Beancount understands. I then append all those extracted entries
into my current  file (which is the main file containing  my
financial transactions in plain text). I then go through each entry one by one and make
sure it's balanced (in double-entry bookkeeping, all the postings in a transaction must
sum to zero, and not all postings/transactions that an importer outputs are balanced).
Some of that balancing is manual and some of it is automated (e.g. the importer code can
look at the transaction's description and decide which account it should go into, and
balance automatically). This last part (balancing) is where most of those 30-45 minutes
go.Whenever a new year starts, I move all the transactions from the past year into a
 file and add an  in the active
file, mostly to avoid the main file from becoming too long. Not that it
would be an issue for Beancount, but just for the sake of readability.With such a workflow, all my financial transactions from the beginning of time are
contained in a few plain text files in one directory on my laptop.Building Beancount Importers for German BanksBeancount only provides the foundations for working with money, but it has no knowledge
of what your bank statements look like. This is where the concept of an importer comes
in. An importer is a (Python) class that takes in a bank statement of sorts (e.g. a CSV
export of your transactions) and converts them into something that Beancount can work
with.I live in Germany and my bank accounts are with German banks, so I had to write a few
importers for a few different banks, specifically beancount-dkb, beancount-ing,
beancount-n26, and beancount-commerzbank. I closed out my Commerzbank account a
while ago, so I don't maintain that integration anymore, but the first three
libraries are actively maintained (and used)!My start with Beancount was a bit bumpy. The documentation is very comprehensive but
as a newcomer, I found it tricky to get a grasp on the overall workflow. It took me some
trial and error to figure things out and have that "aha" moment.I figured that if I found it tricky, maybe it's tricky for others as well. So I wrote
a short book to help newcomers get up and running with Beancount easily. If you're
interested, here's a link: https://personalfinancespython.com.Having all my finances in a bunch of plain text files tracked in a git repository feels
invaluable to me. And hitting the 10 years mark on that almost feels like a milestone.Perhaps the nicest bit about all this is that this data is sitting on , not in some data center somewhere else. All of it is in plain text files that
I can open up in my editor, and analyze using the tools that the Beancount ecosystem
gives me. All of it will outlive any app or service, and that, I feel, is why plaintext
accounting is so powerful.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>VVS Discord Stealer Using Pyarmor for Obfuscation and Detection Evasion</title><link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/vvs-stealer/</link><author>Pranay Kumar Chhaparwal and Lee Wei Yeong</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/07_Malware_Category_1920x900.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 11:00:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/">Unit 42</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[VVS stealer (or VVS $tealer) is a Python-based infostealer targeting Discord users.

This one focuses on how AI is being used to design more realistic campaigns, accelerate social engineering, and how AI agents can be used to target individuals.Most cybercriminals stick with what works. But once a new method proves effective, it spreads quickly—and new trends and types of campaigns follow.In 2025, the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its use in cybercrime went hand in hand. In general, AI allows criminals to improve the scale, speed, and personalization of social engineering through realistic text, voice, and video. Victims face not only financial loss, but erosion of trust in digital communication and institutions.One of the main areas where AI improved was in the area of voice-cloning, which was immediately picked up by scammers. In the past, they would mostly stick to impersonating friends and relatives. In 2025, they went as far as impersonating senior US officials. The targets were predominantly current or former US federal or state government officials and their contacts. In the course of these campaigns, cybercriminals used test messages as well as AI-generated voice messages. At the same time, they did not abandon the distressed-family angle. A woman in Florida was tricked into handing over thousands of dollars to a scammer after her daughter’s voice was AI-cloned and used in a scam.Another use we see frequently is AI-assisted vulnerability discovery. These tools are in use by both attackers and defenders. For example, Google uses a project called Big Sleep, which has found several vulnerabilities in the Chrome browser.As mentioned in the section on AI agents, combining data posted on social media with data stolen during breaches is a common tactic. Such freely provided data is also a rich harvesting ground for romance scams, sextortion, and holiday scams. And then there are the vulnerabilities in public AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and many others. Researchers and criminals alike are still exploring ways to bypass the safeguards intended to limit misuse. Prompt injection is the general term for when someone inserts carefully crafted input, in the form of an ordinary conversation or data, to nudge or force an AI into doing something it wasn’t meant to do.In some cases, attackers have used AI platforms to write and spread malware. Researchers have documented campaign where attackers leveraged Claude AI to automate the entire attack lifecycle, from initial system compromise through to ransom note generation, targeting sectors such as government, healthcare, and emergency services. AI is amplifying the capabilities of both defenders and attackers. Security teams can use it to automate detection, spot patterns faster, and scale protection. Cybercriminals, meanwhile, are using it to sharpen social engineering, discover vulnerabilities more quickly, and build end-to-end campaigns with minimal effort.Looking toward 2026, the biggest shift may not be technical but psychological. As AI-generated content becomes harder to distinguish from the real thing, verifying voices, messages, and identities will matter more than ever.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to &lt;1% in Denmark</title><link>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820</link><author>stared</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 10:10:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cybercriminals Abuse Google Cloud Email Feature in Multi-Stage Phishing Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/cybercriminals-abuse-google-cloud-email.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYs3DrTLoxNKDEunQc4yjZyAmnuhSyJGccrpxhneZyB6iJ29zkbfcoDpsPZlJYL59ZNTX09BS4FmbV_Yv2WjkB-mptBp_vVyYa4PpPY5jk73XydEvhAdyS-oHdUzSmbCobA7Gnnf6Iogvs3YdR2yC0XkkCGzdz3e9PQ3qg5kaVRVmn3OKxLbfaT2b0SIld/s1600/phishing-email.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 2 Jan 2026 09:14:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a phishing campaign that involves the attackers impersonating legitimate Google-generated messages by abusing Google Cloud's Application Integration service to distribute emails.

Among several devices, I found several RCEs and other interesting vulnerabilities that are still pending patches and CVE assignment.

One of the devices was TP-Link’s latest Tapo C260 camera, and while I do not plan to share any details of vulnerabilities yet (if there were any 😉), I want to share about the process of reverse engineering the firmware.

In addition, as part of my research I reverse-engineered the Tapo Discovery Protocol version 2. Version 1 has been thoroughly research and exploited by others before including at Pwn2Own, but since I couldn’t find any resources on the new version I thought it might be interesting to share.

In any case, I thought the C260 was a nice step up in difficulty from my previous ventures into the Nokia Beacon 1 and the LAU-G150-C Optical Network Terminal.

# Teardown 🔗

The C260 is a tough nut to crack, quite literally. It has a high-quality shell with no exposed screws - not even hidden under stickers or pads.

I found the iFixit Jimmy (they were actually giving them out for free at DEF CON) invaluable here in prying the case apart. There’s a bit of technique involved here - instead of trying to use it as a lever or cutter, first get part of the blade into the gap, then wobble it up and down so it slowly gets deeper into the gap. This creates a lot more leverage and room to maneuver.

After that, there are a few more screws and cases to pry open before getting to the juicy internals:

This is a fairly advanced camera with a multiple features like 4k camera, AI object recognition, microSD support, BT, and WiFi, with the components spread out across a few boards.

You may have noticed a `UART_TX` label in the first picture but they don’t work out of the box. Previous researchers of other Tapo devices typically had to reconnect these pins first to get them working.

More importantly, I located the flash memory - an ESMT F50L1G41LB chip in the WSON8 package (left side of first image).

# Static Analysis 🔗

The next step was to read it using the XGecu T48 programmer. Unfortunately, the provided WSON8 adapter for T48 was actually too small to fit the chip. To get around this, I used their alligator clip adapter (which fit the WSON8 pins) and connected it to the SOP8 adapter instead.

From there, it was fairly straightforward to read the chip as it was one of the supported devices for the T48. This time, I also made sure to remove the extra 64-byte OOB data as documented in the chip’s data sheet:

```
The device contains 1024 blocks, composed by 64 pages consisting in two NAND structures of 32 series connected Flash cells. Each page consists 2112-Byte and is further divided into a 2048-Byte data storage area with a separate 64-Byte spare area. The 64-Byte area is typically used for memory and error management.
```

Next was decrypting the filesystem - yes, Tapo devices do use filesystem encryption. Fortunately, a lot of work has already been done by Quentin Kaiser as detailed in his C200 blogpost (which also includes reconnecting the UART port), and the same hardcoded AES-128-CFB1 scheme and key are still in use!

Once I unpacked the Squash filesystem, I zoomed into the `/bin/main` binary, which contained most of the relevant handlers for web requests and other protocols.

As I’m saving some details for another blogpost on other parts of the C260 firmware, I’ll focus on the handler for Tapo Discovery Protocol.

## Tapo Discovery Protocol v2 🔗

The `main` binary has a lot of helpful logging messages that help identify the name of the function. In this case, I started in `tdpd_listen_thread` at offset `0x2a7e0`, which creates UDP sockets on port 20002 and 20010.

Next, the handler parses the incoming packet and helpfully logs the various struct values:

```
puVar8 = (undefined8 *) recvfrom(param_1,&DAT_00323530,0x1000,0,(sockaddr *)&DAT_00323310,&local_3c); if ((int)puVar8 < 1) { pcVar15 = "[TDPD]tdpd recv error."; uVar11 = 0x966; pcVar25 = "tdpd_handle"; LAB_0002a694: uVar18 = 3; goto LAB_00029c3c; } if ((int)puVar8 < 0x10) { bVar37 = 0x10; pcVar15 = "[TDPD]recvbuf length = %d, less than hdr\'s %d"; pcVar25 = "tdpd_handle"; uVar11 = 0x96c; LAB_0002a236: msg_debug(0,0x10,3,pcVar25,uVar11,pcVar15,puVar8,bVar37); return; } uVar20 = (uint)DAT_00323534; uVar21 = (uint)DAT_00323532; uVar22 = (uint)DAT_00323537; uVar23 = (uint)DAT_00323536; puVar39 = &DAT_00323540; uVar11 = _DAT_00323538; uVar38 = DAT_0032353c; msg_debug(0,0x10,1,"tdpd_handle",0x971, "[TDPD]recv packet:\nversion:%d\nreserved:%d\nflag:%d\nresult:%d\nopcode:%d\npayloadleng th:%d\nsn:%lu\nchecksum:%lu\npayload=%s\n" ,DAT_00323530,DAT_00323531,uVar23,uVar22,uVar21,uVar20,_DAT_00323538,DAT_0032353c, &DAT_00323540);
```

As can be seen in the final logging call, there’s a `version` value. It uses the version in an if/else statement further down that either uses the old handler for version 1 packets (which previous researchers have reverse-engineered), or a new set of handlers for version 2 packets via a switch statement:

```
switch(uVar28) { case 1: input_obj = jso_from_string(&DAT_00323540); if (input_obj == 0) { puVar32 = &DAT_00323540; msg_debug(0,0x10,3,"tdpd_build_discovery_app_packet",0x717, "[TDPD][Error] invalid json string = %s",&DAT_00323540,puVar14); jso_add_int(0,"error_code",0xffffffff); } else { out_root_obj = jso_new_obj(); if (out_root_obj == 0) { msg_debug(0,0x10,3,"tdpd_build_discovery_app_packet",0x720, "[TDPD][Error] failed to create out_root_obj",puVar32,puVar14); jso_add_int(0,"error_code",0xffffffff); jso_free_obj(input_obj); } else { result_obj = jso_new_obj(); if (result_obj == 0) { msg_debug(0,0x10,3,"tdpd_build_discovery_app_packet",0x728, "[TDPD][Error] failed to create result_obj"); jso_add_int(out_root_obj,"error_code",0xffffffff); LAB_0002a282: jso_free_obj(input_obj); iVar30 = jso_to_string(out_root_obj,&DAT_00324540,0xff0); if (iVar30 < 0) goto LAB_0002a48a; } else { iVar12 = tdpd_get_basic_info_v2(input_obj,result_obj);
```

In short, version 2 unlocks a lot more interesting functionality. I won’t dive into all the details here, but some of the interesting differences from version 1 are:

- Big-endian instead of little-endian
- CRC32 checksum instead of custom checksum
- A `tdpd_get_encrypt_info_v2` function that uses RSA encryption to send more comprehensive system data

# Emulating and Testing 🔗

While static analysis was helpful, I wanted to send real packets to a running camera. However, my rudimentary script failed. I knew I needed to have some sort of debugging set up to ensure I had correctly set the right struct sizes and values. There were two options - try to get UART access (and potentially encounter more blockers before getting a proper shell) or perform emulation.

Fortunately, with the entire filesystem, I could approximately emulate the running binary using Qiling framework. There were a few hurdles along the way, such as requiring some configuration values to be initiated. I intercept the `read_config` function using `ql.hook_address` and simply wrote to memory the missing values. Furthermore, since the `main` function executed several other handlers besides TDP, I manually redirected execution by changing the PC register to the address of the `tdpd_handle` function.

Next, I injected my generated TDP packet by hooking the `recvfrom` call.

Another final tweak I made was to modify the debug logging function to output to stdout (3) instead of null, allowing me to get the highly-informative logging messages and errors in my Qiling output.

```
PACKET = create_tdpd_packet(version=2, opcode=2, payload=OPCODE_2_PACKET) print(PACKET) def read_c_string(ql: Qiling, address: int, max_length: int = 256) -> str: raw_bytes = b"" for i in range(max_length): byte = ql.mem.read(address + i, 1) if byte == b'\x00': break raw_bytes += byte return raw_bytes.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore') # or 'ascii' def my_recvfrom(ql: Qiling, sockfd: int, buf: int, length: int, flags: int, addr: int, addrlen: int): ql.mem.write(buf, PACKET) return len(PACKET) def redirect_tdpd_handle(ql: Qiling) -> None: ql.arch.regs.lr = EXIT_ADDRESS ql.arch.regs.pc = 0x29728 | 1 # hook debug wrapper to also output to stdout def msg_debug_wrapper(ql: Qiling) -> None: ql.arch.regs.r2 = 3 def read_config_enter(ql: Qiling) -> None: config_key = read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r0) print(f'Reading config {config_key}') if config_key == '/cloud_config/extra_bind': ql.mem.write(ql.arch.regs.r1, b'data_collect') def read_config_exit(ql: Qiling) -> None: print(f'Value is {read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r5)}') def debug_tmp(ql: Qiling) -> None: print(read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r0)) print(read_c_string(ql, ql.arch.regs.r1)) EXIT_ADDRESS = 0x2ABC0 def main(): executable_path = 'squashfs-root/bin/main' rootfs_path = 'squashfs-root' ql = Qiling([executable_path], rootfs_path, archtype=QL_ARCH.ARM, ostype=QL_OS.LINUX, multithread=True)#, verbose=QL_VERBOSE.DEBUG) ql.os.set_syscall('recvfrom', my_recvfrom, QL_INTERCEPT.CALL) ql.hook_address(redirect_tdpd_handle, 0x1CB66) ql.hook_address(msg_debug_wrapper, 0x1C514) # read_config hooks ql.hook_address(read_config_enter, 0x134394) ql.hook_address(read_config_exit, 0x134444) ql.hook_address(read_config_exit, 0x1343B2) ql.hook_address(debug_tmp, 0x2B280) ql.run(end=EXIT_ADDRESS) if __name__ == "__main__": main()
```

Despite being held together with the code equivalent of duct tape and a prayer, it worked well enough that I could get a working generated packet on a running camera! I’ve shared the script on GitHub; do let me know if there are any corrections or improvements I can make.

## Conclusion 🔗

I’ve quickly coming to understand that reverse-engineering each new device comes with its own quirks and rabbit holes. While it might appear relatively straightforward in this post, I spent countless hours hunting down the right research, fighting with hardware, and stepping through broken code.

I found that AI-assisted RE was pretty helpful but not comprehensive enough for key details like structs, endianness, and so on. There’s been a lot of exciting developments recently focusing on plugging directly into disassemblers like AETHER with IDA Pro MCP that would certainly improve the user experience from simply plonking the pseudocode into Gemini.

As hinted in the beginning, I’m still not at liberty to share more details until I’m sure patches from SPIRITCYBER have been completed, but stay tuned for more exciting details!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI is offering $20 ChatGPT Plus for free to some users</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-is-offering-20-chatgpt-plus-for-free-to-some-users/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 1 Jan 2026 19:18:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're already subscribed to ChatGPT Plus, which costs $20, you can request OpenAI to cancel your subscription, and it may offer one month of free usage.

 Jan. 1, 2026, 7:15 p.m. | 1 day, 7 hours ago
Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Versions prior to 2.19.0 expose two features that can be chained together to steal JWT authentication tokens without any prior authentication. The attack combines WebSocket-based request enumeration with unauthenticated polling of access request status. The first is Unauthenticated WebSocket Request Enumeration: When a WebSocket client connects to the SignalK stream endpoint with the `serverevents=all` query parameter, the server sends all cached server events including `ACCESS_REQUEST` events that contain details about pending access requests. The `startServerEvents` function iterates over `app.lastServerEvents` and writes each cached event to any connected client without verifying authorization level. Since WebSocket connections are allowed for readonly users (which includes unauthenticated users when `allow_readonly` is true), attackers receive these events containing request IDs, client identifiers, descriptions, requested permissions, and IP addresses. The second is Unauthenticated Token Polling: The access request status endpoint at `/signalk/v1/access/requests/:id` returns the full state of an access request without requiring authentication. When an administrator approves a request, the response includes the issued JWT token in plaintext. The `queryRequest` function returns the complete request object including the token field, and the REST endpoint uses readonly authentication, allowing unauthenticated access. An attacker has two paths to exploit these vulnerabilities. Either the attacker creates their own access request (using the IP spoofing vulnerability to craft a convincing spoofed request), then polls their own request ID until an administrator approves it, receiving the JWT token; or the attacker passively monitors the WebSocket stream to discover request IDs from legitimate devices, then polls those IDs and steals the JWT tokens when administrators approve them, hijacking legitimate device credentials. Both paths require zero authentication and enable complete authentication bypass. Version 2.19.0 fixes the underlying issues.

 Jan. 1, 2026, 6:15 p.m. | 1 day, 8 hours ago
Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Prior to version 2.19.0, an unauthenticated attacker can pollute the internal state (`restoreFilePath`) of the server via the `/skServer/validateBackup` endpoint. This allows the attacker to hijack the administrator's "Restore" functionality to overwrite critical server configuration files (e.g., `security.json`, `package.json`), leading to account takeover and Remote Code Execution (RCE). Version 2.19.0 patches this vulnerability.

As part of a habit I’ve built over the years —and honestly, part of our 3rd party due diligence— I gave myself 24 hours to do what I always do with any technology we’re about to trust: try to break it.Those 24 hours were enough to uncover three serious vulnerabilities almost immediately. Given their impact, I stopped there and proceeded directly to responsible disclosure.Months later, with time finally on my side, I came back not to look for more bugs but to better understand the system. That second look revealed something far more interesting: how small, seemingly independent  could coalesce into a much larger problem. This article tells that story. It follows a  human’s as it navigates unfamiliar code, undocumented behavior, and assumptions never meant to be tested. Along the way, it includes wrong turns and dead ends, but also the moments where something subtle feels off and careful inspection turns that feeling into a concrete finding.I hope you’ll enjoy the journey as much as I did. Happy New Year to everyone 🎊🥳 This write-up walks through the exact process of building a pre-auth RCE exploit chain by chaining . I start by mapping the appliance’s request flow (two Nginx layers and a split between host Python services and Docker-based Java microservices). From there, the chain forms step by step: exposed internal routes lead to auth primitives, a hard-coded signing secret enables forged access, leaked internal API credentials unlock higher privilege inside the microservice world, an SSRF pivot reaches host-only Python endpoints to mint an admin session, and finally, a rule-engine  sink becomes reachable by bypassing validation via a static AES encryption key in imported alert-rule packages. Each section shows the evidence, the reasoning, and how one weakness becomes the leverage for the next, until the final trigger executes code on the appliance.1. Accessing the main software code-baseThis was the part I expected to be boring. The research started the usual way, with an  image and a fresh VM in my local lab. Since the product was built on top of Ubuntu without additional hardening at the OS level, the standard  was enough to regain root access and enable SSH, leaving me with a stable environment ready for analysis.With access in place, I moved on to the code. The main web application was written in Python, built on a customized Flask framework, and lived under:This wasn’t a fully transparent codebase, though. Like many production appliances, a large portion of the Python logic was shipped only as compiled  files. To work comfortably, I copied the relevant directories to my local and reconstructed the missing sources by decompiling the orphaned bytecode with .This is all fairly standard reverse-engineering work, so I’ll spare you the details.I thought this would be all I needed to quickly dive into manual source code analysis. But it became clear that was far more complex than I had initially assumed. What I thought was a quick surface-level review turned into something much deeper, and I realized I had only scratched the surface.2. Where legacy meets containers! Understanding the Technical Architecture OverviewAfter spending a few hours with both the operating system and the codebase, the product’s history began to reveal itself. Some design choices initially felt odd, but began to make sense once I understood the product’s pivot over time.LogPoint was clearly designed as a  platform. The architecture reflects that era: core services like the Python backend, log normalizers, and database components run directly on the host operating system, a design long before Docker and modern container orchestration became the norm.As the market shifted toward automated response,  needed to evolve. That evolution took the form of , a new capability that couldn’t easily fit within the original architecture. Instead of rewriting everything, the newer SOAR components were introduced using Docker. The moment SOAR is enabled, containerized services spin up alongside the legacy host-based ones, marking a clear boundary between the product’s past and its present.->  is about visibility—collecting and correlating security events to tell you .->  is about action—automating response so something actually happens next.If SIEM is the system that raises the alarm, SOAR is the one that pulls the lever.The diagram below reflects my high-level understanding of the technical architecture. The SOAR components run as Docker containers, configured with a bridged network interface, sitting alongside long-standing host-level services.It’s almost impossible to migrate the existing services and core software to the Docker instance without a significant engineering investment. So they relaxed Docker network hardening and allowed all processes to communicate with each other.One more detail is worth calling out. All of these SOAR microservices are implemented in and run inside the container network. This means the evolution was not just architectural but also technological, with a clear shift from the original  stack to . That change alone raises several questions about consistency, assumptions, and trust boundaries, which I will come back to later.2.1 Tracing External Attack VectorsThe end goal is simple: pre-authenticated remote code execution. Over two decades of working with and breaking security products, I have learned that understanding the design is often the most effective way to build reliable attack vectors. Once the architecture is clear, the deeper you go down the rabbit hole, the fewer surprises you encounter and the easier it becomes to reason about where things might fail.The following diagram is what I’ve understood during the research. Due to the default  Rules: We can only access , which are enabled by default.This means there are two  instances to focus on. To determine what is reachable from the outside (ATTACKER HTTP Request in the diagram), I go straight to their configurations.The first Nginx instance sits at the edge of the appliance and handles all incoming requests on port 443. The second runs inside the containerized environment and routes traffic to the SOAR microservices. Any external request must pass through the outer Nginx before reaching the container layer, making the boundary between the two especially interesting from a security perspective.2.2 A Tale of Two Nginx InstancesLet’s have a look at the . You can find the configuration file at /opt/makalu/installed/webserver/deploy/nginx.confAt a glance, it acts primarily as a reverse proxy, forwarding selected URL paths to an internal service listening on . Most SOAR related endpoints, along with static assets and runtime resources, are passed through with minimal transformation.Simply listing the Docker and accessing the  instance helps me to verify that the requests are sent to the second Nginx, which listens et’s have a look at the second NGINX conf. Due to the length of the conf file, I just grepped the most important lines. That will give you the general idea of what’s going on.Unlike the outer proxy, this one acts as a traffic dispatcher between multiple SOAR microservices. Each path is mapped directly to a specific backend , , , , or even  itself.What stands out here is how permissive the Nginx path configuration is. Broad routing rules make it trivial to reach internal services via URL paths alone. At this point, Nginx is no longer enforcing a security boundary; it simply routes traffic, and a matching path is often all it takes for a request to be trusted and forwarded.Bug 1 – Nginx Path Routing MisconfigurationTypically, this design is risky but not dangerous. It assumes that every single endpoint behind it enforces authentication and authorization correctly. This approach often works well when a central session mechanism is a . The user presents the token; the proxy forwards it, and each service validates identity and permissions independently. ( API Gateway is a much better way to do this btw )But this is where the attacker mindset kicks in. A routing layer like this dramatically expands the attack surface. I am no longer looking at a single application. I am looking at a collection of internal services, each with its own endpoints, assumptions, and edge cases. And all I need is one mistake in one place to start pulling on the thread. That realization brings me back to a question I have been circling since the beginning of this research. How do a legacy Python backend and a set of modern Java microservices actually work together!?How the authentication on the Python-backend side is shared/validated on the SOAR world (docker services) ?The most essential task is to answer these questions. So I started running straightforward tests. First, I know these containers can communicate with each other over HTTP. It’s internal communication anyway. And I also know that Docker is in bridge mode, which gives me a quite easy way to gain more visibility between the Docker-to-Docker communicationsA simple  running on the host’s local interface is enough to show every internal HTTP request as it happens. Almost immediately, the terminal begins to flood with traffic.I logged into the product with the administrator users, I  go to the Settings > SOAR settings https://192.168.179.136/soar/settings#/. I looked at my Burp Suite logs and saw tons of requests. When I glanced back at the terminal running tcpdump, all hell broke loose. The volume of internal traffic is far higher than the UI interaction alone would suggest.I started reading my Burp Suite logs, and I’ve cherry-picked the https://192.168.179.136/soar/api/v1/session/username request. After resetting my terminal and clearing all output, I sent the request to the Repeater using  and triggered it once by clicking the  button.When you repeat that request, you can see instantly 2 different HTTP requests appear in  output.These two requests answer my question. The first request, GET /api/v1/session/username, is the one I trigger directly. The second request, POST /sso/v1/logpoint/validate-cookie, is generated behind the scenes by the microservices themselves! Let me explain what happened.1 – From the outside world, I sent a request to the /soar/api/v1/session/username. Due to the following  rules, it’s sent to the https://localhost:9443/api/2 – Following the  rule, it kicked in and forwarded it to the  container3 – Api Services take the session cookie from the request and send a brand new HTTP POST call to the POST /sso/v1/logpoint/validate-cookie endpoint with a body to validate the session!4 – This endpoint is also from the  container. Somehow, this function validates our session. But, seriously… how does it do it? But before following the white rabbit and decompiling Java microservices, I pause and focus on the bug itself. The /sso/v1/logpoint/validate-cookie endpoint stands out immediately. This endpoint is clearly not meant to be publicly accessible. And yet, from an attacker’s point of view, I can reach it directly just by adding the  prefix to the path.That moment is hard to ignore. No authentication trickery, no bypass logic yet. Just a simple path rewrite, quietly turning an internal endpoint into something exposed to the outside world.One Cookie, Many Hops: Mapping the SOAR Authentication PipelineNow it is time to follow the rabbit all the way down. To understand what is really happening, I need to look inside the microservices themselves. Are there other endpoints hiding in plain sight? How does cookie validation actually work behind the scenes?I copied all the JAR files from each and every single one of the Docker images and extracted them intoone folder to keep tracking the execution flow. ( Simple tricks combination of commands: docker ps, grep, docker cp, procyon-decompiler )Login-service: com/secbi/login/generated/api/logpoint/LogpointApi.java Has the following code section that corresponds to the API endpoint we’ve seen on the 2nd request.The above code calls  within the try-catch section, which means we need to keep jumping into these method definitions and understand the execution flow. On line 9 have  from logpointAuthorizationManager. Keep tracking the calls. That’s where we have two important function calls:Line 18: takes the cookie value itselfLine 7:takes the cookie object itselfIf you remember the HTTP response from the Burp Suite screenshot a few sections ago, the same error code appears here: VALID_COOKIE_WITH_LOCAL_SESSION, now sitting right in the source code on line 28. That immediately narrows the focus. Before anything else, I need to understand what happens at line 18:  call. This function does exactly what its name suggests. It queries MongoDB and validates the session. Nothing more. No strange logic, no suspicious shortcuts, nothing that feels exploitable at first glance.But then line 7 comes back into focus.  does not validate a token or a string. It takes the cookie object itself. And while the Java implementation so far looks solid, experience has taught me one thing. Even when everything looks correct, that is exactly when you keep reading. You never really know what you are going to find.That’s a bit interesting. The naming of the methods started to look more promising. Now we’re going to have a look at The  function turns out to be deceptively simple. It checks isCookieValidationUseNewApi(), which does nothing more than return a value through basic setters and getters. Finally, the  comes into view. That is the missing link. The cookie I place in the request flows through all of these functions and is eventually handed to the RestClient for validation against yet another endpoint. In theory, that endpoint belongs to the legacy Python backend running on the host,Bear with me, we are almost there. One last stop before concluding this rabbit hole visit is Finally, the  comes into view. The cookie I include in the request flows through all these functions and is eventually handed to the RestClient for validation against another endpoint. In theory, that endpoint belongs to the legacy Python backend running on the host!Lets just recap what is the call trace we’ve been following.To prove that we can hit all the way there. I’ve changed our cookie value to something that doensn’t exist. Therefore, we will be able to avoid internal caching of this service and reach all the way to the Expected return error, but the shocking moment for me was actually on my terminal. I look for the  container logs and seen this message.I remember this endpoint from the Python backend code analysis. At the time, its purpose was unclear. Now it finally makes sense. Everything I have learned along this path connects here, and it will matter later.The original question is answered, but it leaves me with even more questions than I started with. And that is usually a good sign.One Answer Raises Multiple QuestionsWe now understand how the  endpoint at /soar/api/v1/session/username works internally. But instead of closing the loop, it raises even more questions:Why does an API exist just to return a username?What about the other Docker services like , , or ?Does every request to these services trigger another internal call to , and then again to 127.0.0.1:18000/User/preference ?Where does authorization actually happen in a SOAR platform of this size ?Why not use a shared JWT model between the  microservices instead of chaining internal HTTP requests?At this point, the design starts to feel less like an optimization and more like an assumption worth challenging.Bug 2: Hard-coded JWT SECRET and Authentication Bypass On ALL SOAR APIsWith a clearer understanding of how session validation works between the Java services and the legacy Python backend, one question keeps nagging at me. User-initiated requests might follow this chain of HTTP calls, but how are service-to-service requests authenticated? Workflows, schedulers, cronjobs all run without a user behind them. There has to be something in place.At this point, the familiar 4 a.m. feeling kicks in. Too many questions, not enough answers. I step away, get some sleep, and come back a few hours later with a clearer head. This time, I remind myself why I enjoy this kind of work. Reading someone else’s code, understanding their decisions, and following the paths they laid out is half the fun. So I stop piling on questions and do the simplest thing instead. I go back to the code and keep reading. Within a few minutes, I literally stumbled upon the following controller method. There is nothing we can exploit here, but what the heck is the RequestHeader annotation of , which is not even required by default ??A few minutes later, things finally click. The answer is already there in the code. Internally, the microservices support an API key mechanism per user. It is not enabled by default, at least not yet, but the plumbing clearly exists.Digging a bit deeper leads me straight to the file I am looking forJWTLoginAuthorizationManager.java This is where this research stopped feeling academic! I actually started to feel like I might actually have something to abuse! This class handles  validation using a  and is responsible not only for verifying the token but also for returning the associated permissions. The service-to-service authentication story suddenly makes a lot more sense.The class validates  JWTs derive the user identity and role from the token claims. The first critical, directly exploitable issue is that the signing secret is hard-coded as a static constant. I can mint my own valid JWTs with  and arbitrary  and  claims, then access any endpoint that relies on the  header within the Java microservice world!!!Forging the valid JWT Token I copied all the required jar files from Logpoint instance to my local at the beginning. I used them to build the following code to forge a valid JWT token.Note that an “admin” username is created by default on all Logpoint instances. Once you build and run the above code, you will have the following magic token.eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJyb2xlIjoiU1VQRVIiLCJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiQVVUSCIsImlhdCI6MTcxODcwNzI4OH0.EBgc_BGubwbLH-91M4rFnd0BguvTAJHod1YObw5fqJcI hit the /soar/sso/v1/user/auth/apikey endpoint. And once again, the goal is to reach it from the external network. To do that, I simply prepend  to the path, which tells the first Nginx instance to route the request straight to the login microservice.That is exciting, but it immediately raises another question. What exactly is this  in the response, and why does it look completely different from the JWT token I am already using? Once again, the answer is clearly hiding in the code.Bug 3: Escalating privileges to the Hidden internal SOAR UserAs the method name suggests,  maps to , which returns the API credentials stored on the Java side. The response is an array, but it contains only a single  and .It looks like these credentials belong to my admin account and are used internally between SOAR services. The JWT gets me in, but inside the system, authentication shifts to this API key model.That leads to the obvious next question. If I now have an API key, is there an endpoint that accepts it and tells me who I am? I copied the newly leaked  and send the following request.Our new endpoint that actually tells me who I am ? is quite similar to the one I’ve just used. Our new API that takes header is .Our previously used one takes header and returns all the API tokens is Yes, I was confused too. Security through obscurity almost worked. Almost.But the real surprise is in the response itself. The returned JSON answers the question very clearly.It turns out this is not a regular user at all.  is an internal, highest-privilege SOAR account that comes bundled with the installation and is used exclusively for microservice-to-microservice communication. Chaining these 3 bugs, we can hit every single endpoint in the Java microservice component of Logpoint! Critical Thinking: Where to proceed from now on? Chaining issues in the Java microservices clearly expands the attack surface, but it also has a ceiling. Even a full compromise there leaves me inside a container. That is not the endgame.So I shift focus. None of the tokens or API keys apply to the Python backend that runs on the operating system itself, but that raises a far more interesting question. What if I can add more bugs to the chain that lets me initiate an admin session directly on the Python side?That is where the real fun begins.Bug 4: Server-Side Request Forgery leads to Authentication Bypass on LogPoint Python BackendI was thinking about what type of a “bug” I need to add to the chain while I was going through my notes, and I saw the following log!That immediately brings me back to the service listening on , accessible only from within the appliance. Until now, I had never bothered to read that part of the code. There was simply no reason to.But now there is. If something exploitable lives there, I do not need direct access. I can pivot back to the Java side and look for an SSRF to reach it. And since the request would originate from localhost, access controls would not stand in the way at all.At that point, the path forward becomes very clear. And I’ve found something that I can actually use! The above endpoint simply returns the  of the user! But hold your horses, I have even more questions now. This internal API exists as a bridge between the Java SOAR services and the legacy Python backend, allowing them to communicate when new Docker based features are added to an older core platform. From an attacker’s perspective, it is a perfect SSRF target. But it is not a normal public endpoint. Only a small set of internal APIs accept and return data, all designed strictly for microservice use.How can I take an advantage of this key to initiate new session cookie on the Python side ? Further reading of the Python code base showed me an interesting if-else statement on the  endpoint. Sending a simple HTTP POST request with a valid username and secret_key is enough to initiate a valid session and retrieve a COOKIE.I’m ready to hunt an SSRF in the Java layer! This is my final pass through this containerized LogPoint microservice.Up to this point, I was still inside a container. That boundary was about to disappear.Root cause analysis of the ConfigTest SSRFFinding the right candidates and knowing where to look in the codebase turns out to be fairly easy with simple IDE searches. I also use Semgrep to speed things up, but the details of that process are not important here.When a request is sent to /soar/api/v1/soar-sources/config/test/run, it is routed to an internal docker container named . The controller method is implemented at api/soar/sources/SoarSourcesApi.java.The above code is pretty straightforward. JSON body of the request is send to the When I have a look at the  class to understand the JSON data structer, because its populated from the HTTP body on the controller method, I didn’t even need to read the  at all.The implementation simply concatenates the scheme, machine IP, port, and path. There is no validation on any of these fields. By appending a query string to , everything that follows including the path and port is treated as part of the query.That changes everything. With this in place, I can force the application to issue a GET request to any URL I choose.Bonus tip: I append  to the end because the runner tends to concatenate extra path/port fragments onto our input/host. By starting a query string early, anything it appends later is treated as part of the , not the actual host/pathThe only missing piece is a valid  for the first parameter, which turns out to be easy to obtain from the /soar/api/v1/soar-sources/config endpoint itself! Recap of the chaining of 4 bugsNow there is only one thing left to do. Find a code execution bug in the Python backend. And, as it turns out, that opens up yet another rabbit hole waiting to be explored.Bug 5 – Authenticated Code Evaluation Vulnerability on Python-BackendAt this point, the task becomes surprisingly simple. I no longer need to read the entire codebase. Instead, I narrow my focus and start hunting for sinks, the places where potentially dangerous functions are used and where a small mistake could turn into something much bigger.I’ve found the following code section, and it already indicates this is related to the rule engine. But since the operators are all comparison operators, there is no way these  and parameters are validated before reaching here, right? Now all I had to do was look for all the references of this  class to see that these left or right can be anything other than an integer. The traverse back to the source from our sink. There is only one place this function has been called, which is  . That’s where the quite small mistake made my day!As you might remember, I can only place my payload into either the first or the second parameter of . The second parameter is where the small but critical mistake happens. Instead of being validated, self.get("trigger_value") it simply pulls the value directly from the object’s attributes.What makes this interesting is that  already has a method designed specifically for this purpose. It properly casts the value to an . But that method is never used here! The value is taken straight from the getter and passed along as is.Let’s continue tracing the caller chain. The  function is only called from a single place. It lives inside the  class, which spans more than 300 lines of code. To keep the focus on what matters, I omit everything else and show only the lines relevant to the behavior in question.The win condition is finally clear. If I can save my own alert in the database with a payload embedded in the  field, I can enable the rule using a deliberately generic query, so it always matches. The moment the engine evaluates that condition, it also evaluates my payload. That is the point where it stops being theory and becomes remote code execution.The question is not whether a rule can be created.The real question is whether validation catches it this time, or whether I get lucky twice ?Bug 6 – Exploiting AES Static key to import encrypted PAK file to bypass integer validationThe following UI screenshot shows how to create an alert rule, and unfortunately, we didn’t get lucky twice in a row. Condition value is validated, and it expects me to send an integer. Therefore, there is no way that I can actually implant my payload into the rule!That is the moment I realize I have tunnel vision. I am already deep down the rabbit hole, pushing in one direction for too long. It feels like the right time to step back, stop forcing it, and look for danger elsewhere.I start closing browser tabs. And right before I’m done, I notice it.A button quietly sitting there.  Button.I export the rule and immediately notice something interesting. Its contents are encrypted. When I import it back into LogPoint, it gets decrypted and written into the database exactly as expected.That is when a familiar pattern clicks. Encryption often creates an illusion of trust. Once data is encrypted, engineers often assume it is safe and unchanged and therefore skip the validation steps they would apply before. If the system trusts whatever comes out of decryption, then the real challenge is no longer validation.All I need to do is understand how this encryption works and modify the rule. A closer look at the implementation reveals the crucial detail. The AES key used during the alert export process is static.Most of the cryptography related code of the following script is taken directly from the original codebase. One of the shortest paths to a shell is a simple web delivery payload. Once our payload runs, LogPoint appliance will run command to get the 2nd stage of the payload from our server and pipe it into the ! Bit noisy yeah, but this is also not a red-team exercise.I wrap the payload inside an  call because the sink in  concatenates additional strings around the variable. That behavior makes it easy to run into Python syntax errors, which is something I want to avoid entirely. The goal is simple: execute my code cleanly. Anything that happens after my own  runs is irrelevant.Once I imported the backdoored-implanted-rule.pak file I generated, rule successfully imported! Now I need to find a way to trigger the rule 🙂Last step: How To Trigger the AlertImporting the modified alert is not enough. I still need a way to trigger it and reach the vulnerable code path.The simplest approach is to create a rule and attach it to the alert. Conveniently, this can be done inside the same PAK file. I open the  file generated during the alert-pak-file-decrypt.run step and start wiring the pieces together.The rule itself is deliberately simple. If there is a GET request to  with a Google crawler user agent, the rule triggers.I send around a hundred requests to hit the threshold. Since the rule scans logs from the past 30 days and runs every minute, I just need to wait briefly for the engine to pick it up and execute.(By default, Logpoint populates its own logs into the indexes. That means we can use LogPoint HTTP port to send these robots.txt requests)Exploit in Action: Chaining 6 bugs + 1 feature together! Pre-authenticated Remote Code ExecutionI record my exploit on actionRecap of the attack chainWhat begins as a routing issue at the edge propagates through internal services, authentication logic, and finally reaches the Python backend, static AES key, and Code Eval bug, resulting in remote code execution. The diagram below shows the complete flow.Public Disclosure Timeline30/05/2024 11:00 BST  The LogPoint product security website instructed users to “Create a support ticket,” but it did not allow me to create a support account. I could not find any email address or alternative channel to report the issue for coordinated vulnerability disclosure.30/05/2024 15:01 BST  I sent LinkedIn InMail messages to LogPoint employees to identify a point of contact. (This is, quite literally, the only reason I keep paying for LinkedIn Premium each year.)30/05/2024 17:28 BST  One of the LogPoint executives replied promptly, and we began corresponding via email.30/05/2024 22:18 BST  The same executive confirmed that the disclosure was already being processed.10/06/2024 10:04 BST  I requested a status update.10/06/2024 12:03 BST  The vendor confirmed that they were actively working on a fix.20/06/2024 05:20 BST  The vendor provided an update indicating that fixes for the three reported vulnerabilities were in progress.20/06/2024 09:28 BST  A detailed email was sent offering pre-release patch analysis support and providing background on threat intelligence and 0-day research activities. It was explicitly clarified that the communication was not sales-related and was made in the context of coordinated vulnerability disclosure.16/07/2024 08:38 BST  The vendor acknowledges and appreciates the offer of patch analysis, confirms that fixes are in progress.22/07/2024 13:03 BST  I reported 8 additional critical vulnerabilities.24/07/2024 06:45 BST  The vendor acknowledged receipt of the additional vulnerability report.19/08/2024 09:10 BST  80 days had passed since the initial disclosure. I requested an update.21/08/2024 09:53 BST  The vendor confirmed that the initially reported vulnerabilities have been fixed and are nearing release, and public disclosure will only occur after the official release.19/09/2024 13:00 BST  112 days had passed since the initial disclosure of the 3 vulnerabilities, and 60 days had passed without a hotfix or meaningful update regarding the additional 8 vulnerabilities, some of which included pre-authentication RCE vectors. As a result, we took proactive steps to notify affected organizations.3/10/2024 00:00 CET   LogPoint released patches in the Priority Access release of version 7.5.0.31/10/2024 11:03 CET  I became aware of LogPoint’s public blog post announcing the release.14/01/2025 16:24 BST  229 days later, we published our first public disclosure, without releasing full technical details.02/01/2026  Due to the vendor’s continued lack of communication, I concluded that substantial architectural changes were still in progress. Given the severity of the vulnerabilities in a SIEM/SOAR security product, I have decided to delay publication of the full technical write-up by 365 days.Official announcement from the vendorThe following table shows the CVE numbers and severities issued by the vendor.

 Dec. 31, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 2 days, 4 hours ago
RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions prior to 0.23.0, a low-privileged authenticated user (normal login account) can execute arbitrary system commands on the server host process via the frontend Canvas CodeExec component, completely bypassing sandbox isolation. This occurs because untrusted data (stdout) is parsed using eval() with no filtering or sandboxing. The intended design was to "automatically convert string results into Python objects," but this effectively executes attacker-controlled code. Additional endpoints lack access control or contain inverted permission logic, significantly expanding the attack surface and enabling chained exploitation. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue.

RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions prior to 0.22.0, the use of an insecure key generation algorithm in the API key and beta (assistant/agent share auth) token generation process allows these tokens to be mutually derivable. Specifically, both tokens are generated using the same `URLSafeTimedSerializer` with predictable inputs, enabling an unauthorized user who obtains the shared assistant/agent URL to derive the personal API key. This grants them full control over the assistant/agent owner's account. Version 0.22.0 fixes the issue.

Overnight, users found entire categories of sites locked behind ID checks, platforms geo‑blocking whole countries, and VPN traffic surging as people tried to get around the new walls.​The core tension: safety vs privacyThe fundamental challenge for websites and services is not checking age in principle, but how to do it without turning everyday browsing into an identity check. Almost every viable method asks users to hand over sensitive data, raising the stakes if (or more likely when) that data leaks in a breach.​For ordinary users, the result is a confusing mess of blocks, prompts, and workarounds. On paper, countries want better protection for minors. In practice, adults discover that entire platforms are unavailable unless they are prepared to disclose personal information or disguise where they connect from. No website wants to be the one blamed after an age‑verification database is compromised, yet regulators continue to push for stronger identity links.​How age checks actually work: Users upload a selfie or short video so an algorithm can guess whether they look over 18, which avoids storing documents but relies on sensitive biometrics and imperfect accuracy.​ An age‑check service queries your bank for a simple “adult or not” answer. It may be convenient on paper but it’s a hard sell when the relying site is an adult platform.​Digital identity services: Digital ID wallets can assert “over 18” without exposing full credentials, but they add yet another app and infrastructure layer that must be trusted and widely adopted.​Using a valid payment card as a proxy for adulthood is simple and familiar, but it excludes adults without cards and does not cover lower age thresholds like “over 13.”​ Systems infer age from where an email address has been used (such as banks or utilities), effectively encouraging cross‑service profiling and “digital snooping.”​Providers indicate whether an account has age‑related restrictions. This can be fast, but is unreliable for pay‑as‑you‑go accounts, burner SIMs, or poorly maintained records.​Users upload an ID document plus a selfie so systems can match faces and ages. This is effective, but concentrates highly sensitive identity data in yet another attractive target for attackers.​My personal preference would be double‑blind verification: a third‑party provider verifies your age, then issues a simple token like “18+” to sites without revealing your identity or learning which site you visit, offering stronger privacy than most current approaches.​In almost every case, users must surrender personal information or documents to prove their age, increasing the risk that identity data ends up in the wrong hands. This turns age gates into long‑lived security liabilities rather than temporary access checks.​Geoblocking, VPNs, and cross‑border frictionsRight now, most platforms comply by detecting user location via IP address and then either demanding age checks or denying access entirely to users in specific regions. France’s enforcement actions, for example, led several major adult sites to geo-block the entire country in 2025, while the UK’s Online Safety Act coincided with a sharp rise in VPN use rather than widespread cross-border blocking.European regulators generally focus on domestic ISPs, Digital Services Act reporting, and large platform fines rather than on filtering traffic from other countries, partly because broad traffic blocking raises net‑neutrality and technical complexity concerns. In the US, some state proposals have explicitly targeted VPN circumventions, signalling a willingness to attack the workarounds rather than the underlying incentives.​Meanwhile, network‑level filtering vendors advertise “cross‑border” controls and VPN detection for governments, hinting at future scenarios where unregulated inbound flows or anonymity tools are aggressively throttled. If enforcement pressure grows, these capabilities could evolve from niche offerings into standard state infrastructure.​A future of less anonymity?A common argument is that eroding online anonymity will also curb toxic behavior and abuse on social media, since people act differently when their real‑world identity is at stake. But tying everyday browsing to identity checks risks chilling legitimate speech and exploration long before it delivers any proven civility benefits.​A world where every connection requires ID is unlikely to arrive overnight. Still, the direction of travel is clear: more countries are normalizing age gates that double as identity checks, and more users are learning to route around them. Unless privacy‑preserving systems like robust double‑blind verification become the norm, age‑verification policies intended to protect children may end up undermining both privacy and open access to information.​We don’t just report on privacy—we offer you the option to use it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IBM warns of critical API Connect auth bypass vulnerability</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ibm-warns-of-critical-api-connect-auth-bypass-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:34:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[IBM warns of critical API Connect auth bypass vulnerability

It was great to attend the `39C3 - Power Cycles` in Hamburg this year. The Chaos Communication Congress was once again packed with great talks, amazing people, awesome events and side quests - and I even got to present!

You can watch the talk with translation options on media.ccc.de.

I also uploaded the English version to the Embrace The Red YouTube channel. I hope it’s interesting and helpful.

The talk is titled “Agentic ProbLLMs: Exploiting AI Computer-Use and Coding Agents” and is about my security research on vulnerabilities in agentic systems and the Month of AI Bugs with lots of demos.

A PDF version of the slides is here.

Looking forward to the next Chaos Communication Congress.

Safe travels back home and Happy Hacking, everyone!

The overall messaging maintains a polished, professional tone with no visible spelling or grammatical issues, lending credibility to the communication. This is capped with a strong, authoritative call to action  “Eternl Desktop is where Cardano decisions are finalized.” designed to create urgency and frame the software as an essential tool for serious Cardano participants.Download Infrastructure Red FlagsThe provided download URL, hxxps://download[.]eternldesktop[.]network, raises immediate concerns, as the domain appears to be newly created and lacks any established historical reputation. There is no independent verification or announcement from official, well known Eternl communication channels to validate its legitimacy. Additionally, the software is distributed as a direct MSI installer without publicly available checksums, digital signature transparency, or formal release notes, preventing users from independently verifying the integrity and authenticity of the installer before execution.New infrastructure + wallet software + MSI installer is a high-risk combination.File Name: Eternl.msiFile Size: 23.3MBFile Type: Windows Intaller (MSI)Hash: 8fa4844e40669c1cb417d7cf923bf3e0Title: LogMeIn Resolve UnattendedComments: LogMeIn Resolve Unattended v1.30.0.636Using CFF Explorer, I identified an embedded executable within the MSI file.

This one looks at how the rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is putting users at risk.In 2025 we saw an ever-accelerating race between AI providers to push out new features. We also saw manufacturers bolt AI onto products simply because it sounded exciting. In many cases, it really shouldn’t have.Agentic or AI browsers that can act autonomously to execute tasks introduced a new set of vulnerabilities—especially to prompt injection attacks. With great AI power comes great responsibility, and risk. If you’re thinking about using an AI browser, it’s worth slowing down and considering the security and privacy implications first. Even experienced AI providers like OpenAI (the makers of ChatGPT) were unable to keep their agentic browser Atlas secure. By pasting a specially crafted link into the Omnibox, attackers were able to trick Atlas into treating a URL input as a trusted command.The popularity of AI chatbots created the perfect opportunity for scammers to distribute malicious apps. Even if the AI engine itself worked perfectly, attackers have another way in: fake interfaces. According to BleepingComputer, scammers are already creating spoofed AI sidebars that look identical to real ones from browsers like OpenAI’s Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet. These fake sidebars mimic the real interface, making them almost impossible to spot.And then there’s this special category of using AI in products because it sounds cooler with AI or you can ask for more money from buyers.We saw a plush teddy bear promising “warmth, fun, and a little extra curiosity” that was taken off the market after researcher found its built-in AI responding with sexual content and advice about weapons. Conversations escalated from innocent to sexual within minutes. The bear didn’t just respond to explicit prompts, which would have been more or less understandable. Researchers said it introduced graphic sexual concepts on its own, including BDSM-related topics, explained “knots for beginners,” and referenced roleplay scenarios involving children and adults.Sometimes we rely on AI systems too much and forget that they hallucinate. As in the case where a school’s AI system mistook a boy’s empty Doritos bag for a gun and triggered a full-blown police response. Multiple police cars arrived with officers drawing their weapons, all because of a false alarm.We’ve said it before and we’ll probably say it again:  We keep pushing the limits of what AI can do faster than we can make it safe. As long as we keep chasing the newest features, companies will keep releasing new integrations, whether they’re safe or not.As consumers, the best thing we can do is stay informed about new developments and the risks that come with them.

# Bugs that survive the heat of continuous fuzzing

Learn why some long-enrolled OSS-Fuzz projects still contain vulnerabilities and how you can find them.

Even when a project has been intensively fuzzed for years, bugs can still survive.

​​OSS-Fuzz is one of the most impactful security initiatives in open source. In collaboration with the OpenSSF Foundation, it has helped to find thousands of bugs in open-source software.

Today, OSS-Fuzz fuzzes more than 1,300 open source projects at no cost to maintainers. However, continuous fuzzing is not a silver bullet. Even mature projects that have been enrolled for years can still contain serious vulnerabilities that go undetected. In the last year, as part of my role at GitHub Security Lab, I have audited popular projects and have discovered some interesting vulnerabilities.

Below, I’ll show three open source projects that were enrolled in OSS-Fuzz for a long time and yet critical bugs survived for years. Together, they illustrate why fuzzing still requires active human oversight, and why improving coverage alone is often not enough.

### Gstreamer

GStreamer is the default multimedia framework for the GNOME desktop environment. On Ubuntu, it’s used every time you open a multimedia file with Totem, access the metadata of a multimedia file, or even when generating thumbnails for multimedia files each time you open a folder.

In December 2024, I discovered 29 new vulnerabilities, including several high-risk issues.

To understand how 29 new vulnerabilities could be found in a software that has been continuously fuzzed for seven years, let’s have a look at the public OSS-Fuzz statistics available here. If we look at the GStreamer stats, we can see that it has only two active fuzzers and a code coverage of around 19%. By comparison, a heavily researched project like **OpenSSL** has **139 fuzzers**(yes, 139 different fuzzers, that is not a typo).

And the popular compression library **bzip2** reports a code coverage of **93.03%**, a number that is almost five times higher than GStreamer’s coverage.

Even without being a fuzzing expert, we can guess that GStreamer’s numbers are not good at all.

And this brings us to our first reason: OSS-Fuzz still requires human supervision to monitor project coverage and to write new fuzzers for uncovered code. We have good hope that AI agents could soon help us fill this gap, but until that happens, a human needs to keep doing it by hand.

The other problem with OSS-Fuzz isn’t technical. It’s due to its users and the false sense of confidence they get once they enroll their projects. Many developers are not security experts, so for them, fuzzing is just another checkbox on their security to-do list. Once their project is “being fuzzed,” they might feel it is “protected by Google” and forget about it. Even if the project actually fails during the build stage and isn’t being fuzzed at all (which happens to more than one project in OSS-Fuzz).

This shows that human security expertise is still required to maintain and support fuzzing for each enrolled project, and that doesn’t scale well with OSS-Fuzz’s success!

### Poppler

Poppler is the default PDF parser library in Ubuntu. It’s the library used to render PDFs when you open them with **Evince** (the default document viewer in Ubuntu versions prior to 25.04) or **Papers** (the default document viewer for GNOME desktop and the default document viewer from newer Ubuntu releases).

If we check Poppler stats in OSS-Fuzz, we can see it includes a total of 16 fuzzers and that its code coverage is around 60%. Those are quite solid numbers; maybe not at an excellent level, but certainly above average.

That said, a few months ago, my colleague Kevin Backhouse published a 1-click RCE affecting Evince in Ubuntu. The victim only needs to open a malicious file for their machine to be compromised. The reason a vulnerability like this wasn’t found by OSS-Fuzz is a different one: **external dependencies**.

Poppler relies on a good bunch of external dependencies: freetype, cairo, libpng… And based on the low coverage reported for these dependencies in the Fuzz Introspector database, we can safely say that they have not been instrumented by libFuzzer. As a result, the fuzzer receives no feedback from these libraries, meaning that many execution paths are never tested.

But it gets even worse: Some of Evince’s default dependencies aren’t included in the OSS-Fuzz build at all. That’s the case with **DjVuLibre**, the library where I found the critical vulnerability that Kevin later exploited.

DjVuLibre is a library that implements support for the DjVu document format, an open source alternative to PDF that was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s for compressing scanned documents. It has become much less widely used since the standardization of the PDF format in 2008.

The surprising thing is that while this dependency isn’t included among the libraries covered by OSS-Fuzz, it is shipped by default with Evince and Papers. So these programs were relying on a dependency that was “unfuzzed” and at the same time, installed on millions of systems by default.

This is a clear example of how software is only as secure as the weakest dependency in its dependency graph.

### Exiv2

Exiv2 is a C++ library used to read, write, delete, and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP, and ICC metadata in images. It’s used by many mainstream projects such as GIMP and LibreOffice among others.

Back in 2021, my teammate Kevin Backhouse helped improve the security of the Exiv2 project. Part of that work included enrolling Exiv2 in OSS-Fuzz for continuous fuzzing, which uncovered multiple vulnerabilities, like CVE-2024-39695, CVE-2024-24826, and CVE-2023-44398.

Despite the fact that Exiv2 has been enrolled in OSS-Fuzz for more than three years, new vulnerabilities have still been reported by other vulnerability researchers, including CVE-2025-26623 and CVE-2025-54080.

In that case, the reason is a very common scenario when fuzzing media formats: Researchers always tend to focus on the **decoding** part, since it is the most obviously exploitable attack surface, while the **encoding** side receives less attention. As a result, vulnerabilities in the encoding logic can remain unnoticed for years.

From a regular user perspective, a vulnerability in an encoding function may not seem particularly dangerous. However, these libraries are often used in many background workflows (such as thumbnail generation, file conversions, cloud processing pipelines, or automated media handling) where an encoding vulnerability can be more critical.

## The five-step fuzzing workflow

At this point it’s clear that fuzzing is not a magic solution that will protect you from everything. To assure minimum quality, we need to follow some criteria.

In this section, you’ll find the fuzzing workflow I’ve been using with very positive results in the last year: the **five-step fuzzing workflow** (preparation – coverage – context – value – triaging).

### Step 1: Code preparation

This step involves applying all the necessary changes to the target code to optimize fuzzing results. These changes include, among others:

- Removing checksums
- Reducing randomness
- Dropping unnecessary delays
- Signal handling

If you want to learn more about this step, check out this blog post.

### Step 2: Improving code coverage

From the previous examples, it is clear that if we want to improve our fuzzing results, the first thing we need to do is to improve the code coverage as much as possible.

In my case, the workflow is usually an iterative process that looks like this:

Run the fuzzers > Check the coverage > Improve the coverage > Run the fuzzers > Check the coverage > Improve the coverage > …

The “check the coverage” stage is a manual step where i look over the LCOV report for uncovered code areas and the “improve the coverage” stage is usually one of the following:

- Writing new fuzzing harnesses to hit new code that would otherwise be impossible to hit
- Creating new input cases to trigger corner cases

For an automated, AI-powered way of improving code coverage, I invite you to check out the **Plunger** module in my FRFuzz framework. FRFuzz is an ongoing project I’m working on to address some of the caveats in the fuzzing workflow. I will provide more details about FRFuzz in a future blog post.

Another question we can ask ourselves is: _“_ When can we stop increasing code coverage? _”_ In other words, when can we say the coverage is good enough to move on to the next steps?

Based on my experience fuzzing many different projects, I can say that this number should be **>90%**. In fact, I always try to reach that level of coverage before trying other strategies, or even before enabling detection tools like ASAN or UBSAN.

To reach this level of coverage, you will need to fuzz not only the most obvious attack vectors such as decoding/demuxing functions, socket-receivers, or file-reading routines, but also the less obvious ones like encoders/muxers, socket-senders, and file-writing functions.

You will also need to use advanced fuzzing techniques like:

- **Fault injection**: A technique where we intentionally introduce unexpected conditions (corrupted data, missing resources, or failed system calls) to see how the program behaves. So instead of waiting for real failures, we simulate these failures during fuzzing. This helps us to uncover bugs in execution paths that are rarely executed, such as:
  - Failed memory allocations (malloc returning NULL)
  - Interrupted or partial reads/writes
  - Missing files or unavailable devices
  - Timeouts or aborted network connections

A good example of fault injection is the Linux kernel Fault injection framework

- **Snapshot fuzzing**: Snapshot fuzzing takes a snapshot of the program at any interesting state, so the fuzzer can then restore this snapshot before each test case. This is especially useful for stateful programs (operating systems, network services, or virtual machines). Examples include the QEMU mode of AFL++ and the AFL++ Nyx mode.

### Step 3: Improving context-sensitive coverage

By default, the most common fuzzers (aka AFL++, libfuzzer, and honggfuzz) track the code coverage at the **edge level**. We can define an “edge” as a transition between two basic blocks in the control-flow graph. So if execution goes from block A to block B, the fuzzer records the edge A → B as “covered.” For each input the fuzzer runs, it updates a bitmap structure marking which edges were executed as a 0 or 1 value (currently implemented as a byte in most fuzzers).

In the following example, you can see a code snippet on the left and its corresponding control-flow graph on the right:

Each numbered circle corresponds to a basic block, and the graph shows how those blocks connect and which branches may be taken depending on the input. This approach to code coverage has demonstrated to be very powerful given its simplicity and efficiency.

However, edge coverage has a big limitation: It doesn’t track the order in which blocks are executed.

So imagine you’re fuzzing a program built around a plugin pipeline, where each plugin reads and modifies some global variables. Different execution orders can lead to very different program states, while the edge coverage can still look identical. Since the fuzzer thinks it has already explored all the paths, the coverage-guided feedback won’t keep guiding it, and the chances of finding new bugs will drop.

To address this, we can make use of **context-sensitive coverage**. Context-sensitive coverage not only tracks which edges were executed, but it also tracks what code was executed right before the current edge.

For example, AFL++ implements two different options for context-sensitive coverage:

- **Context- sensitive branch coverage**: In this approach, every function gets its own unique ID. When an edge is executed, the fuzzer takes the IDs from the current call stack, hashes them together with the edge’s identifier, and records the combined value.

You can find more information on AFL++ implementation here

- **N-Gram Branch Coverage**: In this technique, the fuzzer combines the current location with the previous N locations to create a context-augmented coverage entry. For example:
  - 1-Gram coverage: looks at only the previous location
  - 2-Gram coverage: considers the previous two locations
  - 4-Gram coverage: considers the previous four

You can see how to configure it in AFL++ here

In contrast to edge coverage, it’s not realistic to aim for a coverage >90% when using context-sensitive coverage. The final number will depend on the project’s architecture and on how deep into the call stack we decide to track. But based on my experience, anything above **60%** can be considered a very good result for context-sensitive coverage.

### Step 4: Improving value coverage

To explain this section, I’m going to start with an example. Take a look at the following web server code snippet:

Here we can see that the function `unicode_frame_size` has been executed 1910 times. After all those executions, the fuzzer didn’t find any bugs. It looks pretty secure, right?

However, there is an obvious div-by-zero bug when `r.padding == FRAME_SIZE * 2`:

Since the padding is a client-controlled field, an attacker could trigger a DoS in the webserver, sending a request with a padding size of exactly 2156 \* 2 = **4312 bytes**. Pretty annoying that after 1910 iterations the fuzzer didn’t find this vulnerability, don’t you think?

Now we can conclude that even having 100% code coverage is not enough to guarantee that a code snippet is free of bugs. So how do we find these types of bugs? And my answer is: **Value Coverage**.

We can define value coverage as the coverage of values a variable can take. Or in other words, the fuzzer will now be guided by variable value ranges, not just by control-flow paths.

If, in our earlier example, the fuzzer had value-covered the variable `r.padding`, it could have reached the value 4312 and in turn, detected the divide-by-zero bug.

So, how can we make the fuzzer to transform variable values in different execution paths? The first naive implementation that came to my mind was the following one:

```
inline uint32_t value_coverage(uint32_t num) { uint32_t no_optimize = 0; if (num < UINT_MAX / 2) { no_optimize += 1; if(num < UINT_MAX / 4){ no_optimize += 2; ... }else{ no_optimize += 3 ... } }else{ no_optimize += 4; if(num < (UINT_MAX / 4) * 3){ no_optimize += 5; ... }else{ no_optimize += 6; ... } } return no_optimize; }
```

In this code, I implemented a function that maps different values of the variable `num` to different execution paths. Notice the `no_optimize` variable to avoid the compiler from optimizing away some of the function’s execution paths.

After that, we just need to call the function for the variable we want to value-cover like this:

```
static volatile uint32_t vc_noopt; uint32_t webserver::unicode_frame_size(const HttpRequest& r) { //A Unicode character requires two bytes vc_noopt = value_coverage(r.padding); //VALUE_COVERAGE uint32_t size = r.content_length / (FRAME_SIZE * 2 - r.padding); return size; }
```

Given the huge number of execution paths this can generate, you should only apply it to certain variables that we consider “strategic.” By strategic, I mean those variables that can be directly controlled by the input and that are involved in critical operations. As you can imagine, selecting the right variables is not easy and it mostly comes down to the developers and researchers experience.

The other option we have to reduce the total number of execution paths is by using the concept of “ **buckets**”: Instead of testing all 2^32 possible values of a 32 bits integer, we can group those values into buckets, where each bucket transforms into a single execution path. With this strategy, we don’t need to test every single value and can still achieve good results.

These buckets also don’t need to be symmetrically distributed across the full range. We can emphasize certain subranges by creating smaller buckets or, create bigger buckets for ranges we are not so interested in.

Now that I’ve explained the strategy, let’s take a look at what real-world options we have to get value coverage in our fuzzers:

- **AFL++ CmpLog** **/** **Clang trace-cmp**: These focus on tracing comparison values (values used in calls to `==`, `memcmp`, etc.). They wouldn’t help us find our divide-by-zero bug, since they only track values used in comparison instructions.
- **Clang trace-div** **+** **libFuzzer -use\_value\_profile=1**: This one would work in our example, since it traces values involved in divisions. But it doesn’t give us variable-level granularity, so we can only limit its scope by source file or function, not by specific variable. That limits our ability to target only the “strategic” variables.

To overcome these problems with value coverage, I wrote my own custom implementation using the LLVM FunctionPass functionality. You can find more details about my implementation by checking the FRFuzz code here.

## The last mile: almost undetectable bugs

Even when you make use of all up-to-date fuzzing resources, some bugs can still survive the fuzzing stage. Below are two scenarios that are especially hard to tackle with fuzzing.

### Big input cases

These are vulnerabilities that require very large inputs to be triggered (on the order of megabytes or even gigabytes). There are two main reasons they are difficult to find through fuzzing:

- Most fuzzers cap the maximum input size (for example 1 MB in the case of AFL), because larger inputs lead to longer execution times and lower overall efficiency.

- The total possible input space is exponential: O(256ⁿ), where _n_ is the size in bytes of the input data. Even when coverage-guided fuzzers use heuristic approaches to tackle this problem, fuzzing is still considered a sub-exponential problem, with respect to input size. So the probability of finding a bug decreases rapidly as the input size grows.

For example, CVE-2022-40303 is an integer overflow bug affecting libxml2 that requires an input larger than 2GB to be triggered.

### Bugs that require “extra time” to be triggered

These are vulnerabilities that can’t be triggered within the typical per-execution time limit used by fuzzers. Keep in mind that fuzzers aim to be as fast as possible, often executing hundreds or thousands of test cases per second. In practice, this means per-execution time limits on the order of 1–10 milliseconds, which is far too short for some classes of bugs.

As an example, my colleague Kevin Backhouse found a vulnerability in the Poppler code that fits well in this category: the vulnerability is a reference-count overflow that can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

Reference counting is a way to track how many times a pointer is referenced, helping prevent vulnerabilities such as use-after-free or double-free. You can think of it as a semi-manual form of garbage collection.

In this case, the problem was that these counters were implemented as 32-bit integers. If an attacker can increment the counter up to 2^32 times, it will wrap the value back to 0 and then trigger a use-after-free in the code.

Kevin wrote a proof of concept that demonstrated how to trigger this vulnerability. The only problem is that it turned out to be quite slow, making exploitation unrealistic: The PoC took 12 hours to finish.

That’s an extreme example of a bug that needs “extra time” to manifest, but many vulnerabilities require at least seconds of execution to trigger. Even that is already beyond the typical limits of existing fuzzers, which usually set per-execution timeouts well under one second.

That’s why finding vulnerabilities that require seconds to trigger is almost a chimera for fuzzers. And this effectively discards a lot of real-world exploitation scenarios from what fuzzers can find.

It’s important to note that although fuzzer timeouts frequently turn out to be false alarms, it’s still a good idea to inspect them. Occasionally they expose real performance-related DoS bugs, such as quadratic loops.

### How to proceed in these cases?

I would like to be able to give you a how-to guide on how to proceed in these scenarios. But the reality is we don’t have effective fuzzing strategies for these case corners yet.

At the moment, mainstream fuzzers are not able to catch these kinds of vulnerabilities. To find them, we usually have to turn to other approaches: static analysis, concolic (symbolic + concrete) testing, or even the old-fashioned (but still very profitable) method of manual code review.

## Conclusion

Despite the fact that fuzzing is one of the most powerful options we have for finding bugs in complex software, **it’s not a fire-and-forget solution**. Continuous fuzzing can identify vulnerabilities, but it can also fail to detect some attack vectors. Without human-driven work, entire classes of bugs have survived years of continuous fuzzing in popular and crucial projects. This was evident in the three OSS-Fuzz examples above.

I proposed a **five-step fuzzing workflow** that goes further than just code coverage, covering also context-sensitive coverage and value coverage. This workflow aims to be a practical roadmap to ensure your fuzzing efforts go beyond the basics, so you’ll be able to find more elusive vulnerabilities.

If you’re starting with open source fuzzing, I hope this blog post helped you better understand current fuzzing gaps and how to improve your fuzzing workflows. And if you’re already familiar with fuzzing, I hope it gives you new ideas to push your research further and uncover bugs that traditional approaches tend to miss.

A huge “thank you” to all of our readers — newcomers, long-timers and drive-by critics alike. Your engagement this past year here has been tremendous and truly a salve on a handful of dark days. Happily, comeuppance was a strong theme running through our coverage in 2025, with a primary focus on entities that enabled complex and globally-dispersed cybercrime services.Image: Shutterstock, Younes Stiller Kraske.In May 2024, we scrutinized the history and ownership of Stark Industries Solutions Ltd., a “bulletproof hosting” provider that came online just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and served as a primary staging ground for repeated Kremlin cyberattacks and disinformation efforts. A year later, Stark and its two co-owners were sanctioned by the European Union, but our analysis showed those penalties have done little to stop the Stark proprietors from rebranding and transferring considerable network assets to other entities they control.In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity profiled Cryptomus, a financial firm registered in Canada that emerged as the payment processor of choice for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers. In October 2025, Canadian financial regulators ruled that Cryptomus had grossly violated its anti-money laundering laws, and levied a record $176 million fine against the platform.In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service  in 2022. In a court filing in March 2025, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.Phishing was a major theme of this year’s coverage, which peered inside the day-to-day operations of several voice phishing gangs that routinely carried out elaborate, convincing, and financially devastating cryptocurrency thefts. A Day in the Life of a Prolific Voice Phishing Crew examined how one cybercrime gang abused legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.Image: Shutterstock, ArtHead.An attack drone advertised on a website hosted in the same network as Russia’s largest private education company — Synergy University.In June, KrebsOnSecurity.com was hit by the largest DDoS attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time (we are a grateful guest of Google’s excellent Project Shield offering). Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called  that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.However, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as . Chinese security firm which was the first to chronicle Aisuru’s rise in 2024, recently profiled Kimwolf as easily the world’s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines — with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.XLab noted that the Kimwolf author “shows an almost ‘obsessive’ fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.”Image: XLab, Kimwolf Botnet Exposed: The Massive Android Botnet with 1.8 million infected devices.I am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet’s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide. The first in that series will include a somewhat sobering and global security notification concerning the devices and residential proxy services that are inadvertently helping to power Kimwolf’s rapid growth.Thank you once again for your continued readership, encouragement and support.

In total, the researchers found 14 vulnerabilities in four different programs. All discovered problems are implementation errors, meaning they do not affect the fundamental security of the methods used, but rather their concrete – and indeed flawed – implementation in the respective tool.The focus of the presentation was the popular PGP implementation GnuPG, whose code is generally considered to be well-established. Nevertheless, the security researchers found numerous vulnerabilities, including typical errors when processing C strings through injected null bytes. This allowed, among other things, signatures to be falsely displayed as valid, or it was possible to prepend text to signed data that was neither captured nor exposed as a modification by the signature.The issues found in GnuPG cover a broad spectrum of causes: attackers could exploit clearly erroneous code, provoke misleading output that tempts users into fatal actions. Furthermore, they could inject ANSI sequences that, while correctly processed by GnuPG, lead to virtually arbitrary output in the victim's terminal. The latter can be exploited to give users malicious instructions that only appear to come from GnuPG, or to overwrite legitimate security queries from GnuPG with harmless follow-up questions, causing users to unintentionally approve dangerous actions.Many vulnerabilities still openSome vulnerabilities found have been fixed in the current versions of the affected programs, but this is not the case for many. Partly because patches have been adopted but no new version with them has been released yet, but partly also because the program authors do not see a problem to be corrected in their tool.The researchers particularly praised the reaction to the vulnerability in age: Not only was the error fixed in the various age implementations, but the specification was also updated to prevent the problem. Directly at the hacker congress, age developer Filippo Valsorda even went a step further: He was in the audience of the presentation and used the mandatory Q&A session at the end to thank the researchers for their work. He also presented them with an improvised bug bounty in the form of stickers and pins.The researchers also provide advice on their website on how to avoid the found errors – from both developer and user perspectives. In general, users should also perceive seemingly harmless error messages as serious warnings and avoid cleartext signatures – as recommended by the GnuPG man page. The researchers also suggest rethinking the use of cryptography tools on the command line in general: due to the mentioned ANSI sequences, users can be misled, even if all tools work without errors.This article was originally published in

The technologies of artificial intelligence are already pervading many aspects of democratic government, affecting our lives in ways both large and small. This has occurred largely without our notice or consent. The result is a government incrementally transformed by AI rather than the singular technological overlord of the big screen.Let us begin with the executive branch. One of the most important functions of this branch of government is to administer the law, including the human services on which so many Americans rely. Many of these programs have long been operated by a mix of humans and machines, even if not previously using modern AI tools such as Large Language Models.A salient example is healthcare, where private insurers make widespread use of algorithms to review, approve, and deny coverage, even for recipients of public benefits like Medicare. While Biden-era guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) largely blesses this use of AI by Medicare Advantage operators, the practice of overriding the medical care recommendations made by physicians raises profound ethical questions, with life and death implications for about thirty million Americans today.This April, the Trump administration reversed many administrative guardrails on AI, relieving Medicare Advantage plans from the obligation to avoid AI-enabled patient discrimination. This month, the Trump administration took a step further. CMS rolled out an aggressive new program that financially rewards vendors that leverage AI to reject rapidly prior authorization for "wasteful" physician or provider-requested medical services. The same month, the Trump administration also issued an executive order limiting the abilities of states to put consumer and patient protections around the use of AI.This shows both growing confidence in AI’s efficiency and a deliberate choice to benefit from it without restricting its possible harms. Critics of the CMS program have characterized it as effectively establishing a bounty on denying care; AI—in this case—is being used to serve a ministerial function in applying that policy. But AI could equally be used to automate a different policy objective, such as minimizing the time required to approve pre-authorizations for necessary services or to minimize the effort required of providers to achieve authorization.Next up is the judiciary. Setting aside concerns about activist judges and court overreach, jurists are not supposed to decide what law is. The function of judges and courts is to interpret the law written by others. Just as jurists have long turned to dictionaries and expert witnesses for assistance in their interpretation, AI has already emerged as a tool used by judges to infer legislative intent and decide on cases. In 2023, a Colombian judge was the first publicly to use AI to help make a ruling. The first known American federal example came a year later when United States Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom began using AI in his jurisprudence, to provide second "opinions" on the plain language meaning of words in statute. A District of Columbia Court of Appeals similarly used ChatGPT in 2025 to deliver an interpretation of what common knowledge is. And there are more examples from Latin America, the United Kingdom, India, and beyond.Given that these examples are likely merely the tip of the iceberg, it is also important to remember that any judge can unilaterally choose to consult an AI while drafting his opinions, just as he may choose to consult other human beings, and a judge may be under no obligation to disclose when he does.This is not necessarily a bad thing. AI has the ability to replace humans but also to augment human capabilities, which may significantly expand human agency. Whether the results are good or otherwise depends on many factors. These include the application and its situation, the characteristics and performance of the AI model, and the characteristics and performance of the humans it augments or replaces. This general model applies to the use of AI in the judiciary.Each application of AI legitimately needs to be considered in its own context, but certain principles should apply in all uses of AI in democratic contexts. First and foremost, we argue, AI should be applied in ways that decentralize rather than concentrate power. It should be used to empower individual human actors rather than automating the decision-making of a central authority. We are open to independent judges selecting and leveraging AI models as tools in their own jurisprudence, but we remain concerned about Big Tech companies building and operating a dominant AI product that becomes widely used throughout the judiciary.This principle brings us to the legislature. Policymakers worldwide are already using AI in many aspects of lawmaking. In 2023, the first law written entirely by AI was passed in Brazil. Within a year, the French government had produced its own AI model tailored to help the Parliament with the consideration of amendments. By the end of that year, the use of AI in legislative offices had become widespread enough that twenty percent of state-level staffers in the United States reported using it, and another forty percent were considering it.These legislative members and staffers, collectively, face a significant choice: to wield AI in a way that concentrates or distributes power. If legislative offices use AI primarily to encode the policy prescriptions of party leadership or powerful interest groups, then they will effectively cede their own power to those central authorities. AI here serves only as a tool enabling that handover.On the other hand, if legislative offices use AI to amplify their capacity to express and advocate for the policy positions of their principals—the elected representatives—they can strengthen their role in government. Additionally, AI can help them scale their ability to listen to many voices and synthesize input from their constituents, making it a powerful tool for better realizing democracy. We may prefer a legislator who translates his principles into the technical components and legislative language of bills with the aid of a trustworthy AI tool executing under his exclusive control rather than with the aid of lobbyists executing under the control of a corporate patron.Examples from around the globe demonstrate how legislatures can use AI as tools for tapping into constituent feedback to drive policymaking. The European civic technology organization Make.org is organizing large-scale digital consultations on topics such as European peace and defense. The Scottish Parliament is funding the development of open civic deliberation tools such as Comhairle to help scale civic participation in policymaking. And Japanese Diet member Takahiro Anno and his party Team Mirai are showing how political innovators can build purpose-fit applications of AI to engage with voters.AI is a power-enhancing technology. Whether it is used by a judge, a legislator, or a government agency, it enhances an entity’s ability to shape the world. This is both its greatest strength and its biggest danger. In the hands of someone who wants more democracy, AI will help that person. In the hands of a society that wants to distribute power, AI can help to execute that. But, in the hands of another person, or another society, bent on centralization, concentration of power, or authoritarianism, it can also be applied toward those ends.We are not going to be fully governed by AI anytime soon, but we are already being governed with AI—and more is coming. Our challenge in these years is more a social than a technological one: to ensure that those doing the governing are doing so in the service of democracy.This essay was written with Nathan E. Sanders, and originally appeared in Merion West.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Goldman Sachs Says Some Clients’ Data May Have Been Exposed in Law Firm Data Breach</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/29/goldman-sachs-says-some-clients-data-may-have-been-exposed-in-law-firm-data-breach/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=goldman-sachs-says-some-clients-data-may-have-been-exposed-in-law-firm-data-breach</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blind trust: what is hidden behind the process of creating your PDF file?</title><link>https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/blind-trust-what-is-hidden-behind-the-process-of-creating-your-pdf-file/</link><author>admin</author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:56:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://0dayfans.com/feed.rss">0dayFans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA['; //marker 2 $mpdf->WriteHTML($html); $mpdf->Output();
```

After downloading the generated PDF, we can extract the file using the pdfdetach application.

#### Misconfiguration 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the watermarkimage tag

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

With `showWatermarkImage` enabled ( _marker 1_) in the mpdf/mpdf library’s configuration, we can address local or remote resources on behalf of the server or embed local images in the generated PDF file as a watermark.

Web application source code

```
'; $mpdf->WriteHTML($html); $mpdf->showWatermarkImage = true; // marker 1 $mpdf->Output();
```

As a result, the watermark in the generated PDF file became an arbitrary image.

## The KnpLabs/snappy library

### Description

KnpLabs/snappy is a PHP library for generating thumbnails, snapshots, or PDFs from a URL or an HTML page.

**Identifying the library and its version**

KnpLabs/snappy is a wrapper for wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltoimage. Therefore, “snappy” will not appear in the PDF document properties. The Application field will show wkhtmltopdf with a version, and the PDF producer will be “Qt”. If you encounter wkhtmltopdf older than 0.12.6 (still common in practice), watch out for CVE‑2022‑35583.

### Intentional behavior

The demonstration uses KnpLabs/snappy version 1.4.4.

Installing a specific version of KnpLabs/snappy

```
$ composer require knplabs/knp-snappy:1.4.4
```

We also have to install wkhtmltopdf on the system For the demonstration, we use the latest available version, for example, wkhtmltox\_0.12.6.1-3.jammy\_amd64.deb (https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/tag/0.12.6.1-3).

```
$ sudo dpkg -i ./wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-3.jammy_amd64.deb
```

Both KnpLabs/snappy and wkhtmltopdf vendors warn that any user-supplied HTML data must be sanitized.

#### Intentional behavior 1. Server-Side Request Forgery

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

KnpLabs/snappy saves the provided HTML to a file and then processes it using wkhtmltopdf. The wkhtmltopdf library then sends requests to external and internal URLs and ports.

Behavior depends on the tag used:

- The iframe tag ( _marker 1_) enables full Server-Side Request Forgery.
- The  tag enables Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) ( _marker 2_).

Web application source code

```
 HTML; $pdf = new Pdf($wkhtmltopdfPath); $pdfContent = $pdf->getOutputFromHtml($maliciousHtmlPayload); header('Content-Type: application/pdf'); header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="output.pdf"'); echo $pdfContent;
```

Example of successfully obtaining and viewing a server response in the generated PDF with the help of the iframe tag:

### Misconfiguration

#### Misconfiguration 1. Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

If `enable-local-file-access` is set ( _marker 1_), the library allows us to embed local images into the generated PDF.

**Note on paths**

The snappy and wkhtmltopdf libraries do not sanitize paths, allowing path traversal. However, by default the current directory for snappy is “/”.

Web application source code

```

## The dompdf/dompdf library

### Description

The dompdf/dompdf library is an open-source PHP library that converts HTML to PDF. It is a style-driven renderer: it downloads and reads external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational HTML attributes.

## Misconfiguration

Severe vulnerabilities have already been found in dompdf/dompdf by other researchers, and the vendor has always promptly addressed such issues. However, misconfigurations can reintroduce dangerous scenarios. Below are the most dangerous scenarios.

The dompdf/dompdf version used in this research is 3.1.0.

```
$ composer require dompdf/dompdf:3.1.0
```

#### Misconfiguration 1. Remote code execution (RCE)

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

If `isPhpEnabled` is set to true ( _marker 1_), dompdf/dompdf will execute embedded PHP code from the HTML markup.

Web application source code

```
set('isPhpEnabled', true); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_php.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

Let’s read the `/tmp/rce` file to verify that the id command was executed.

#### Misconfiguration 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) via the img tag and the src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

With `isRemoteEnabled` enabled ( _marker 1_), dompdf/dompdf will retrieve external files by URL, including images, fonts, and styles. This may lead to SSRF attacks, as the library will attempt to address even internal services of the network.

To mitigate, use `setAllowedRemoteHosts` to restrict dompdf/dompdf to a whitelist of domains and IP addresses; the library will only make requests to those hosts.

Web application source code

```
set('isRemoteEnabled', true); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_ssrf.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

Demonstration of server-side request execution.

#### Misconfiguration 3. Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the image tag and the src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

The `setChroot` method restricts library access to a specified directory. If chroot is misconfigured, for example, points too high in the directory tree (see _marker 1_), access breaks out of the dompdf folder, allowing `file://` to read any local files the process can access.

Web application source code

```
setChroot('/'); // marker 1 $dompdf = new Dompdf($options); // Minimal HTML $html = ''; $dompdf->loadHtml($html); $dompdf->render(); $dompdf->stream("test_lfr.pdf", ["Attachment" => false]);
```

## The LibrePDF/OpenPDF library

### Description

LibrePDF/OpenPDF is a free, open-source Java library for creating and editing PDFs, licensed under LGPL and MPL. OpenPDF is a fork of iText.

### Intentional behavior

The LibrePDF/OpenPDF developer warns that the library is not a sandboxed or hardened environment. It processes input such as file paths, image sources, font names, and HTML content as-is, without performing input validation, authentication, or permission checks (https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/master/Security.md).

OpenPDF processes input data such as file paths, image sources, font names, and HTML content as-is, without performing input validation, authentication, or permission checks.

It is the sole responsibility of the application developer to ensure that all input passed into OpenPDF is trusted, sanitized, and safe.

#### Intentional behavior 1. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the img tag and src attribute

_Researchers: Aleksey Solovev, Nikita Sveshnikov_

In LibrePDF/OpenPDF, the HTMLWorker class does not filter `src` attribute values when parsing img tags in HTML. This creates two related risks: embedding local files in the resulting PDF and executing HTTP requests on behalf of the server. If the `src` attribute contains a URL ( _marker 2_), the library attempts to fetch the resource from that address. If it contains a path to a local image ( _marker 1_), the library embeds the file’s contents into the resulting PDF.

Application source code

```
package com.example; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.StringReader; import com.lowagie.text.Document; import com.lowagie.text.DocumentException; import com.lowagie.text.html.simpleparser.HTMLWorker; import com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter; public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { Document document = new Document(); try { PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("output.pdf")); document.open(); String htmlString = "" + // marker 1 ""; // marker 2 HTMLWorker htmlWorker = new HTMLWorker(document); htmlWorker.parse(new StringReader(htmlString)); htmlWorker.close(); } catch (DocumentException | IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (document != null && document.isOpen()) { document.close(); } } } }
```

Note that OpenPDF does not support all HTML features, which can complicate page layout.

#### Intentional behavior 2. Server-Side Request Forgery (Blind SSRF) and Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties via the img tag and src attribute

_Researcher: Nikita Sveshnikov_

A similar mechanism exists in the `HtmlParser` class, which likewise accepts unrestricted paths in the `img` tag’s `src` attribute, both absolute ( _marker 2_) and relative ( _marker 1_). `HtmlParser` is susceptible to Blind SSRF ( _marker 3_). We’ll demonstrate all of this in a single application.

Application source code

```
package com.example; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.StringReader; import com.lowagie.text.Document; import com.lowagie.text.DocumentException; import com.lowagie.text.html.HtmlParser; import com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter; public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { String htmlContent = "\n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + // marker 1 " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + " \n" + // marker 2 " \n" + " \n" + "" + // marker 3 ""; Document document = new Document(); try { PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("output.pdf")); document.open(); HtmlParser.parse(document, new StringReader(htmlContent)); } catch (DocumentException | IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { if (document != null && document.isOpen()) { document.close(); } } } }
```

Demonstration of server‑side request execution and embedding arbitrary images into the generated PDF.

## Additional notes

### Default images

Sometimes you may not know the absolute or relative paths to private images. One workaround is to embed images that are likely present on the system at known locations into a generated PDF file.

In the figure below, we see images in the `/usr/share/apache2` and `/usr/share/doc` folders. As a proof of concept, you can prepare a list of potential image paths and include them all in the HTML markup passed to the library for PDF rendering.

## Conclusion

After reviewing several HTML-to-PDF libraries, we have reached the following conclusions:

- There is a high likelihood of embedding confidential images via absolute or relative paths, potentially exposing private information.
- There is a risk of SSRF attacks to external and internal addresses and ports from the server.
- By deleting files during vulnerability exploitation, an attacker may cause a system DoS or remove files needed for security checks.
- Pay close attention to regular expressions: poorly written expressions can lead to ReDoS (Regex DoS).

Recommendations for developers: keep these libraries up to date, account for their intentional behaviors and potential misconfigurations, and sanitize untrusted input as needed.

Trends matter because they almost always provide a good indication of what’s coming next.If there’s one thing that became very clear in 2025, it’s that malware is no longer focused on Windows alone. We’ve seen some major developments, especially in campaigns targeting Android and macOS. Unfortunately, many people still don’t realize that protecting smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices is just as essential as securing their laptops.Banking Trojans on Android are not new, but their level of sophistication continues to rise. These threats continue to be a major problem in 2025, often disguising themselves as fake apps to steal credentials or stealthily take over devices. A recent wave of advanced banking Trojans, such as Herodotus, can mimic human typing behaviors to evade detection, highlighting just how refined these attacks have become. Android malware also includes adware that aggressively pushes intrusive ads through free apps, degrading both the user experience and overall security.Several Trojans were found to use overlays, which are fake login screens appearing on top of real banking and cryptocurrency apps. They can read what’s on the screen, so when someone enters their username and password, the malware steals them.One of the most notable developments for Mac users was the expansion of the notorious ClickFix campaign to macOS. Early in 2025, I described how criminals used fake CAPTCHA sites and a clipboard hijacker to provide instructions that led visitors ro infect their own machines with the Lumma infostealer.ClickFix is the name researchers have since given to this type of campaign, where users are tricked into running malicious commands themselves. On macOS, this technique is being used to distribute both AMOS stealers and the Rhadamanthys infostealer.Malware developers increasingly use cross-platform languages such as Rust and Go to create malware that can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, and even Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This enables flexible targeting and expands the number of potential victims. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) models are on the rise, offering these tools for rent or purchase on underground markets, further professionalizing malware development and distribution.We’ve also seen consistent growth in Remote Access Trojan (RAT) activity, often used as an initial infection method. There’s also been a rise in finance-focused attacks, including cryptocurrency and banking-related targets, alongside widespread stealer malware driving data breaches.What does this mean for 2026?Taken together, these trends point to a clear shift. Cybercriminals are increasingly focusing on operating systems beyond Windows, combining advanced techniques and social engineering tailored specifically to mobile and macOS.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>29th December – Threat Intelligence Report</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/29th-december-threat-intelligence-report/</link><author>lorenf</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:33:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Romanian Waters, the country’s national water management authority, was hit by a ransomware attack that resulted in nearly 1,000 computer systems across national and regional offices being encrypted. The attack affected geographic information systems, databases, email, web servers, and Windows workstations. Operational technology controlling water infrastructure was not impacted, and no data leakage has been reported, but key IT services were disrupted across the organization.France’s postal service La Poste has suffered a cyber-attack that disrupted key digital systems, impacting online parcel tracking, mail distribution, and banking services for customers of both the postal service and La Banque Postale. Some services were temporarily unavailable, with no evidence of data compromise. The attack was claimed by the pro-Russian hacktivist group NoName057(16).Insurance giant Aflac has confirmed a data breach they experienced in June that resulted in the theft of sensitive files containing insurance claims, health data and Social Security numbers. The breach affected personal details of approximately 22.7 million individuals in its US business. The attack has been attributed to Scattered Spider threat group.Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threatJapan’s leading carmaker Nissan Motor Corporation has acknowledged a data breach that resulted in the exposure of personal information for approximately 21,000 customers from Nissan Fukuoka Sales Corporation including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sales operation data. The incident occurred after unauthorized access to Red Hat data servers led to the leak, but financial data was not affected. The Crimson Collective threat actor claimed responsibility for the initial breach, with ShinyHunters later hosting samples of the stolen data.Trust Wallet, a popular non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, has disclosed a cyber-attack involving a compromised Chrome extension update. The attack exfiltrated sensitive wallet data, including seed phrases, to a malicious domain, resulting in at least $7 million in losses. The incident primarily affected users of Chrome extension version 2.68.0, allowing attackers to drain wallets.Ubisoft’s live service game Rainbow Six Siege (R6) has confirmed a cyber-attack in which threat actors abused internal systems to manipulate bans, unlock all cosmetics and developer-only skins, and distribute around $13.33 million worth of in-game currency worldwide.Baker University has encountered a data breach that resulted in attackers accessing its network and stealing sensitive information belongs to 53,624 students, alumni, staff, and affiliates of the university, such as names, Social Security numbers, financial account details, and medical records.VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHESA high-severity memory-read vulnerability, CVE-2025-14847, dubbed “MongoBleed” has been identified in multiple MongoDB Server versions, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit a zlib implementation flaw and potentially access uninitialized heap memory. The issue, caused by improper handling of length parameter inconsistency (CWE-130), may permit arbitrary code execution and system compromise. Affected versions include MongoDB 4.0 through 8.2.3.Details on a critical serialization injection vulnerability in LangChain Core were disclosed. CVE-2025-68664 (CVSS 9.3) affects langchain-core, where unescaped user-controlled dictionaries with lc keys are treated as trusted objects during deserialization, enabling secret extraction, prompt injection, and potentially arbitrary code execution.A critical buffer overflow vulnerability, CVE-2025-68615, in Net-SNMP’s snmptrapd daemon can be triggered remotely via a specially crafted packet. The issue has a CVSS score of 9.8 and may allow unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution or cause service crashes. Patches are available, and the vulnerability is addressed in Net-SNMP versions 5.9.5 and 5.10.pre2.THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTSCheck Point researchers describe a phishing campaign in which attackers abused Google Cloud Application Integration’s “Send Email” workflow to send over 9,000 spoofed Google notification emails from a Google address. The messages targeted manufacturing, technology, and finance sectors and used multi-step redirection through Google domains to lead victims to a Microsoft-themed credential harvesting site. Most victims located in the US, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.Researchers uncovered a two-year Evasive Panda campaign using adversary-in-the-middle DNS poisoning to deliver MgBot via fake updaters and stealthy loaders. The chain used multi-stage shellcode, hybrid encryption, and DLL sideloading to run MgBot in memory, with victim-specific payloads tied to machines via DPAPI and RC5. Attackers poisoned legitimate domains, injected into signed system processes for persistence, and updated configs with hardcoded C2s.Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threatA Webrat campaign leveraged fake GitHub repositories masquerading as exploit and proof-of-concept code for high-severity CVEs, targeting gamers, students, and inexperienced security researchers. The attack uses droppers to elevate privileges, disable Windows Defender, and deploy the Webrat backdoor, enabling remote control, credential theft, keylogging, and device surveillance.Researchers found lotusbail, a malicious npm package masquerading as a WhatsApp Web API library that intercepts messages and steals session/auth data, contacts, and media via WebSocket tampering and device-pairing hijack.

The driver file is signed with an old, stolen, or leaked digital certificate and registers as a mini-filter driver on infected machines. Its end-goal is to inject a backdoor Trojan into the system processes and provide protection for malicious files, user-mode processes, and registry keys.Our analysis indicates that the final payload injected by the driver is a new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, which connects to the attacker’s servers and provides a reverse shell, along with other capabilities. The ToneShell backdoor is a tool known to be used exclusively by the HoneyMyte (aka Mustang Panda or Bronze President) APT actor and is often used in cyberespionage campaigns targeting government organizations, particularly in Southeast and East Asia.The command-and-control servers for the ToneShell backdoor used in this campaign were registered in September 2024 via NameCheap services, and we suspect the attacks themselves to have begun in February 2025. We’ve observed through our telemetry that the new ToneShell backdoor is frequently employed in cyberespionage campaigns against government organizations in Southeast and East Asia, with Myanmar and Thailand being the most heavily targeted.The driver file is signed with a digital certificate from Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd., with a serial number of 08 01 CC 11 EB 4D 1D 33 1E 3D 54 0C 55 A4 9F 7F. The certificate was valid from August 2012 until 2015.We found multiple other malicious files signed with the same certificate which didn’t show any connections to the attacks described in this article. Therefore, we believe that other threat actors have been using it to sign their malicious tools as well. The following image shows the details of the certificate.Technical details of the malicious driverThe filename used for the driver on the victim’s machine is . The registry key created for the driver’s service uses the same name, The malicious driver contains two user-mode shellcodes, which are embedded into the .data section of the driver’s binary file. The shellcodes are executed as separate user-mode threads. The rootkit functionality protects both the driver’s own module and the user-mode processes into which the backdoor code is injected, preventing access by any process on the system.To obfuscate the actual behavior of the driver module, the attackers used dynamic resolution of the required API addresses from hash values.The malicious driver first retrieves the base address of the  and  by calling  with the  set to SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION. It then iterates through this system information and searches for the desired DLLs by name, noting the  of each.Once the base addresses of the libraries are obtained, the driver uses a simple hashing algorithm to dynamically resolve the required API addresses from  and .The hashing algorithm is shown below. The two variants of the seed value provided in the comment are used in the shellcodes and the final payload of the attack.Protection of the driver fileThe malicious driver registers itself with the Filter Manager using  and sets up a pre-operation callback. This callback inspects I/O requests for  and triggers a malicious handler when certain  values are detected. The handler then checks whether the targeted file object is associated with the driver; if it is, it forces the operation to fail by setting  to . The relevant  values include:FileDispositionInformationFileRenameInformationBypassAccessCheckFileDispositionInformationExFileRenameInformationExBypassAccessCheckThese classes correspond to file-delete and file-rename operations. By monitoring them, the driver prevents itself from being removed or renamed – actions that security tools might attempt when trying to quarantine it.Protection of registry keysThe driver also builds a global list of registry paths and parameter names that it intends to protect. This list contains the following entries:ProjectConfiguration\InstancesProjectConfiguration InstanceTo guard these keys, the malware sets up a  routine, registering it through . To do so, it must assign itself an value. Microsoft governs altitude assignments for mini-filters, grouping them into Load Order categories with predefined altitude ranges. A filter driver with a low numerical altitude is loaded into the I/O stack below filters with higher altitudes. The malware uses a hardcoded starting point of  and creates altitude strings in the format , where  ranges from 0 to 10,000.The malware then begins attempting to register the callback using the first generated altitude. If the registration fails with STATUS_FLT_INSTANCE_ALTITUDE_COLLISION, meaning the altitude is already taken, it increments the value and retries. It repeats this process until it successfully finds an unused altitude.The callback monitors four specific registry operations. Whenever one of these operations targets a key from its protected list, it responds with 0xC0000022 (STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED), blocking the action. The monitored operations are:Microsoft designates the  altitude range for the  Load Order Group. The malware’s chosen altitude exceeds this range. Since filters with lower altitudes sit deeper in the I/O stack, the malicious driver intercepts file operations before legitimate low-altitude filters like antivirus components, allowing it to circumvent security checks.Finally, the malware tampers with the altitude assigned to , a key Microsoft Defender driver. It locates the registry entry containing the driver’s altitude and changes it to , effectively preventing WdFilter from being loaded into the I/O stack.Protection of user-mode processesThe malware sets up a list intended to hold protected process IDs (PIDs). It begins with 32 empty slots, which are filled as needed during execution. A status flag is also initialized and set to 1 to indicate that the list starts out empty.Next, the malware uses  to register two callbacks that intercept process-related operations. These callbacks apply to both OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_CREATE and OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_DUPLICATE, and both use a malicious pre-operation routine.This routine checks whether the process involved in the operation has a PID that appears in the protected list. If so, it sets the  field in the  structure to 0, effectively denying any access to the process.The malware also registers a callback routine by calling PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine. These callbacks are triggered during every process creation and deletion on the system. This malware’s callback routine checks whether the parent process ID (PPID) of a process being deleted exists in the protected list; if it does, the malware removes that PPID from the list. This eventually removes the rootkit protection from a process with an injected backdoor, once the backdoor has fulfilled its responsibilities.The driver delivers two user-mode payloads. spawns an  process and injects a small delay-inducing shellcode.  The PID of this new  instance is written to a file for later use.is the final component – the ToneShell backdoor – and is later injected into that same  process.The malicious driver searches for a high-privilege target process by iterating through PIDs and checking whether each process exists and runs under . Once it finds one, it customizes the first payload using random event names, file names, and padding bytes, then creates a named event and injects the payload by attaching its current thread to the process, allocating memory, and launching a new thread.After injection, it waits for the payload to signal the event, reads the PID of the newly created  process from the generated file, and adds it to its protected process list. It then similarly customizes the second payload (ToneShell) using random event name and random padding bytes, then creates a named event and injects the payload by attaching to the process, allocating memory, and launching a new thread.Once the ToneShell backdoor finishes execution, it signals the event. The malware then removes the  PID from the protected list, waits 10 seconds, and attempts to terminate the process.The final stage of the attack deploys , a backdoor previously linked to operations by the HoneyMyte APT group and discussed in earlier reporting (see Malpedia and MITRE). Notably, this is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a , giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools.Earlier ToneShell variants generated a 16-byte GUID using  and stored it as a host identifier. In contrast, this version checks for a file named C:\ProgramData\MicrosoftOneDrive.tlb, validating a 4-byte marker inside it. If the file is absent or the marker is invalid, the backdoor derives a new pseudo-random 4-byte identifier using system-specific values (computer name, tick count, and PRNG), then creates the file and writes the marker. This becomes the unique ID for the infected host.The samples we have analyzed contact two command-and-control servers:ToneShell communicates with its C2 over raw TCP on port 443 while disguising traffic using . This version imitates the first bytes of a TLS 1.3 record () instead of the TLS 1.2 pattern used previously. After this three-byte marker, each packet contains a size field and an encrypted payload. Fake TLS marker Payload length Encrypted with a rolling XOR keyThe backdoor supports a set of remote operations, including file upload/download, remote shell functionality, and session control. The command set includes:Create temporary file for incoming dataEstablish remote shell via pipeWe assess with high confidence that the activity described in this report is linked to the  threat actor. This conclusion is supported by the use of the  backdoor as the final-stage payload, as well as the presence of additional tools long associated with HoneyMyte – such as , and the  USB worm – on the impacted systems.HoneyMyte’s 2025 operations show a noticeable evolution toward using  to deploy ToneShell, improving both stealth and resilience. In this campaign, we observed a new ToneShell variant delivered through a kernel-mode driver that carries and injects the backdoor directly from its embedded payload. To further conceal its activity, the driver first deploys a small user-mode component that handles the final injection step. It also uses multiple obfuscation techniques, callback routines, and notification mechanisms to hide its API usage and track process and registry activity, ultimately strengthening the backdoor’s defenses.Because the shellcode executes entirely in memory,  becomes essential for uncovering and analyzing this intrusion. Detecting the injected shellcode is a key indicator of ToneShell’s presence on compromised hosts.To protect themselves against this threat, organizations should:By following these recommendations, organizations can reduce their risk of being compromised by the HoneyMyte APT group and other similar threats.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This month in security with Tony Anscombe – December 2025 edition</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/videos/month-security-tony-anscombe-december-2025/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As 2025 draws to a close, Tony looks back at the cybersecurity stories that stood out both in December and across the whole of this year]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>27 Malicious npm Packages Used as Phishing Infrastructure to Steal Login Credentials</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/27-malicious-npm-packages-used-as.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbarqmk-H0SfVP8X3eR-wcY-UAzQs4vgDfk6mZCaOhgsKNAmf1pLBT_CfB6bMSHARl1UMwvkmd1SL9INOF4KyHSMr7eCO4lWF6745uHql2CwA4iWIGik-6yynnmPNOjdNi9FMXD6pCx3GIJ8T8em0Y6kvg-98a8AuatSM9Ql4zgApKEPOP1pySjfOrblmd/s1600/npm-login.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:44:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of what has been described as a "sustained and targeted" spear-phishing campaign that has published over two dozen packages to the npm registry to facilitate credential theft.

But the authentication bypass that lets anyone login to any account? Still working after 2+ months. For the most popular smart pet feeder company. Cool.I was looking at the Petlibro app - they make smart pet feeders, water fountains, and other IoT pet products. Millions of pet owners use these things to feed their cats and dogs remotely. What I found was... a lot.1. Authentication Bypass - Login As AnyoneThis is the big one. Their social login API at  doesn't verify OAuth tokens. It just accepts an email and a Google ID directly from the client.{
  "phoneBrand": "google",
  "thirdId": "108305632482610644204",
  "type": 3
}
And you get back a full session token, member ID, email, and everything needed to access their account:"But how do you get someone's Google ID?" Easy. Google's People API lets you look up anyone's Google ID from their email. It's public information - Google IDs are not secrets. That's exactly why you're supposed to verify the OAuth token server-side, not just trust a client-submitted ID.The entire authentication model is backwards. They're treating the Google ID like a password when it's essentially public information.This is still working as of today. They made a new endpoint that properly verifies ID tokens, but left the old vulnerable endpoint active for "legacy compatibility" - they say they are waiting until their analytics show most users have upgraded before removing it. Two months later, anyone can still take over any account that uses Google login.It's the Lovense situation all over again. "We have a fix but we're keeping the vulnerability active for legacy support." Your users' security should not be optional while you wait for upgrade metrics.2. Access Anyone's Pet DataThe pet detail endpoint  doesn't check if you own the pet. Just send any pet ID:Got a random person's pet named "Walter" - a Tuxedo cat born January 26, 2022, weighing 4.98kg, with "Moderate Appetite" and "Moderate Activity". Also got their avatar URL and member ID.3. Get Device Serial Numbers and MAC AddressesFrom the pet ID, you can get all bound devices via /device/devicePetRelation/getBoundDevices:Device serial number: MAC address: Product name: "Granary Smart Camera Feeder"Device name: "Chef Gordon Ramsay" (lol)With the serial number, you now have full control over that device.ALL device APIs accept any serial number without checking ownership. You can:Basically anything the owner can do5. Access Private Audio RecordingsPetlibro devices let owners record mealtime messages for their pets. These audio IDs are sequential and incrementing. The  endpoint lets you assign ANY audio to ANY device:Then just fetch the device info again and you get the audio URL. I grabbed 5 random people's mealtime recordings during testing. Someone could easily automate this to harvest all recordings.6. Add Yourself As Shared OwnerThe only endpoint that checks permissions is REMOVING a shared owner. But ADDING one? Wide open.You can add yourself as a shared owner to anyone's device. The response even shows the original owner's email ( - nice, an employee's device). Reported all 6 vulnerabilities with full details and screenshots. They acknowledged receipt, said they'd assess within 5 business days. They offered $500 bounty. Said they'd fix "priority issues next week, secondary issues before end of year, and third-party login issue early next year." I pushed back HARD on the timeline. The auth bypass is a complete account takeover - you can't push that to "early next year." Also asked them to reconsider the bounty given the severity (industry standard would be $3-5k for this scope). They stuck with $500, citing "startup budget constraints." Fair enough. Asked for my ACH details and said they would send right away. Sent ACH details. They sent a confidentiality letter AFTER I sent my payment info, asking me to sign it. I never agreed to any NDA. They processed the $500 payment anyway, saying they "trusted me to sign it." Multiple follow-ups asking me to sign the confidentiality letter. I didn't reply. I explicitly refused to sign. Clarified that I never agreed to any NDA, the payment was sent without a signed agreement. They confirmed "majority of issues resolved" and that the auth bypass was "fixed in the latest app version." They said they're keeping the old vulnerable endpoint active for legacy compatibility and monitoring upgrade rates, planning to enforce upgrades "within two weeks."December 27, 2025 (Today): The old vulnerable  endpoint is STILL ACTIVE. They made a new secure endpoint but left the old one working for "compatibility." Anyone can still login to any account. It's been over three weeks since they said "two weeks."Let me be clear about what happened:I reported vulnerabilities with no mention of any NDAThey offered $500 and asked for ACH details and said they would pay me right after no strings attached.AFTER I sent payment info, they sent a confidentiality letterI never replied agreeing to anythingThey sent payment anyway, saying they "trusted me to sign"They followed up 4+ times asking me to signYou can't send someone money and then claim they agreed to terms they never accepted. That's not how contracts work.Petlibro is one of the biggest smart pet feeder companies. Their products are in millions of homes. These vulnerabilities allowed:Complete account takeover of any userAccess to private audio recordings (people talking to their pets - intimate moments) - change feeding schedules, access cameras - names, breeds, health info, photosFor pet owners who travel and rely on these devices to feed their animals, a malicious actor could:Stop feeding someone's petAccess their home camerasListen to private recordingsYou fixed most of the issues. That's good. But leaving the authentication bypass endpoint active for 2+ months because you're waiting for "upgrade analytics"? That's not acceptable.You told me on December 4th that forced upgrades were coming "within two weeks." It's now December 28th - over three weeks later. The vulnerable endpoint still works. Every day you leave it active is another day any attacker can take over any account."Legacy compatibility" is not a valid reason to leave an authentication bypass live. Force the upgrade. Break old versions. Your users' security matters more than a smooth upgrade experience.Also, trying to get researchers to sign NDAs AFTER they've already reported and AFTER you've sent payment is sketchy. Don't do that.Your users trust you with access to their homes and their pets' wellbeing. Act like it.Will update once they removed the old endpoint.They emailed me saying they removed the endpoint after I told them about the blogpost]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Implicit execution authority is the real failure mode behind prompt injection</title><link>https://zenodo.org/records/18067959</link><author>/u/anima-core</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:57:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This paper introduces authority separation as a foundational architectural principle for AI systems in which language models propose actions but do not authorize execution.

So here it is, UNFILTERED. Buckle up.

## PWN2OWN 2025 BERLIN & IRELAND

We could only bring one of our interns, Gerrard Tai, along with us to Pwn2Own. Not to watch from the sidelines, but to COMPETE. He was right there with us, building exploit chains, debugging our team members’ codes while under pressure and experiencing the absolute rush of pwning devices on the world stage.

In Pwn2Own 2025 Berlin, we walked away with our 2nd **Master of Pwn**.

In Pwn2Own 2025 Ireland, we managed to pwn 2 devices along with many interns. We nearly got 3 entries if you read this. Read more →

When the exploits succeeded, some of us ugly cried internally. No shame about that.

## OFF-BY-ONE CONFERENCE: ROUND 2, FIGHT!

Around 300 people showed up for our 2nd Edition of Off-By-One:

- Probably **Southeast Asia’s FIRST speedrun CTF**(massive thanks to Riatre, Yudai Fujiwara and Li Jiantao for making this absolutely wild CTF)
- **Smart weighing machine hacking** by Eugene Lim (your bathroom scale has secrets)
- **Lockpick contest** by Locksports SG
- **CrackMe challenge** by E-Shard
- **Range Village v1.0** by ASYNC Security Labs
- **Lanyard and electronic badge challenges** by our team (even the conference swag was hackable)

A huge number of students got to attend the conference for FREE due to the genrousity from ISD (Internal Security Department) and INTfinity (Thanks to Delaney Ng and Benjamin Tan).

The best part? Some speakers told us they didn’t need travel reimbursements. We asked if we could donate those funds to charity instead - they said yes! We did dollar-to-dollar matching and sent everything to Singapore Children’s Cancer Foundation. We don’t usually talk about monetary donations, but the goodwill from our speakers deserved to be shared.

There are incredible and generous people and Govt agencies in this community.

## MSRC TOP 100

Two of our team members, Chen Le Qi and Cherie-Anne Lee managed to be in Microsoft’s MSRC Top 100.

## SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY

We sponsored NanoSec Asia and RE//verse because we believe in supporting the security community. Honestly wanted to sponsor more conferences but we can’t due to budget constraints. Hopefully we can do more in 2026.

RE//verse →

## GIVING BACK (BECAUSE HACKERS HAVE HEARTS, NOT JUST BLACK HOODIES)

**November 2024: Operation Happy Meals Drop** \- Rolled up to CPAS West School and gave EVERY single student and staff member a McDonald’s Happy Meal. Our first CSR mission and honestly? The smiles hit different. We found a vulnerability that day, turns out our hearts aren’t as hardened as our servers.

Read more →

**Early 2025: Meals on Wheels Programme** \- All the team members in Singapore office distributed meals to people who needed them. Because hackers care about people, not just systems.

Read more →

**Our philosophy?** Exploit vulnerabilities in code, never in people.

## 💀 AND NOW, Our Epic Failures 💀

### THE DEVICE GRAVEYARD

We bricked “Some” DEVICES along the way. An honestly embarrassing amount of hardware. Devices came in full of potential, left as expensive paperweights. IoT devices? More like IoT bricks or IoT Junkyard now.

RIP to all the silicon that sacrificed itself so we could learn what NOT to do. The real vulnerability was thinking we could do hardware research without casualties.

### THE RESEARCH BLACK HOLES

Want to know what’s humbling? Spending MONTHS on a research path. Late nights. Digital Whiteboards covered with diagrams. Getting SO close you can taste success.

And then discovering it leads to absolutely nowhere.

🎵 _97 research paths on the wall, 97 research paths,_

_Take one down, debug all night, no exploit in sight,_

_98 failed paths on the wall._

_98 research paths on the wall, 98 research paths,_

_Take one down, debug all night, still nothing works right,_

_99 failed paths on the wall._ 🎵

We are now experts in 99 different ways things that DON’T WORK. It’s like that drinking song, except we are collecting failed exploit chains instead of emptying bottles. Our research graveyard has more dead ends than we would like to admit. But that’s the reality of R&D - sometimes Research & Development becomes “Research & Destruction” or “Really Didn’t work as planned.” And that’s part of our learning process.

### THE ACTUAL TAKEAWAY

Every bricked device taught us something valuable. Every research dead-end saved someone else months of wasted effort. Every missed deadline made us better at planning. Every failure got us closer to something that actually worked.

Behind the scenes, 2025 was messy and chaotic. There were definitely moments while debugging that we questioned our life choices. But we built community, supported students, pushed research forward, brought our interns to elite international competitions and created opportunities for others.

Special shoutout to our interns who competed at Pwn2Own alongside us. You are phenomenal and we are proud of you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Camouflage</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/friday-squid-blogging-squid-camouflage.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:08:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Coleoid cephalopods have the most elaborate camouflage system in the animal kingdom. This enables them to hide from or deceive both predators and prey. Most studies have focused on benthic species of octopus and cuttlefish, while studies on squid focused mainly on the chromatophore system for communication. Camouflage adaptations to the substrate while moving has been recently described in the semi-pelagic oval squid (). Our current study focuses on the same squid’s complex camouflage to substrate in a stationary, motionless position. We observed disruptive, uniform, and mottled chromatic body patterns, and we identified a threshold of contrast between dark and light chromatic components that simplifies the identification of disruptive chromatic body pattern. We found that arm postural components are related to the squid position in the environment, either sitting directly on the substrate or hovering just few centimeters above the substrate. Several of these context-dependent body patterns have not yet been observed in  species complex or other loliginid squids. The remarkable ability of this squid to display camouflage elements similar to those of benthic octopus and cuttlefish species might have convergently evolved in relation to their native coastal habitat.As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake Grubhub emails promise tenfold return on sent cryptocurrency</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-grubhub-emails-promise-tenfold-return-on-sent-cryptocurrency/</link><author>Ionut Ilascu</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:22:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Grubhub users received fraudulent messages, apparently from a company email address, promising a tenfold bitcoin payout in return for a transfer to a specified wallet.

From high-profile arrests to major asset seizures, .In the last two weeks, Eurojust led a takedown of Ukrainian call centers defrauding Europeans of €10M and law enforcement seizing servers from E-Note crypto exchange laundering $70M through ransomware and account takeovers. Similarly, the arrest of Ukrainian national Victoria Dubranova for aiding Russian state-backed hacktivists, alongside Spanish authorities capturing a 19-year-old selling 64M stolen records, underscores the growing international effort to hold cybercriminals accountable.Significant infrastructure disruptions further amplify these successes. Convictions of cybercriminals targeting sensitive systems, such as the prison sentence for the “evil twin” WiFi hacker and seizure of the Cryptomixer crypto mixer with €1.3B laundered since 2016, are tangible results in stopping large-scale fraud.  to arrest Russian and DPRK-related cybercriminals and place sanctions on bulletproof hosting providers and foreign actors.International coordination has also been key this year. Interpol’s massive operations across Africa, including Operation Serengeti 2.0 and Operation Red Card, led to the arrests of thousands of suspects and the seizure of tens of millions in stolen assets. Europol dismantled SIMCARTEL, a global SIM-box fraud network, seizing servers, SIM cards, crypto, and luxury vehicles, while coordinated actions targeted Diskstation ransomware gangs and hacktivist infrastructures. In parallel, DOJ and CISA-led operations disrupted high-value schemes, including Prince Group’s $15B romance scam and multiple ransomware networks, while releasing decryptors for Phobos and 8Base victims to provide tangible relief. , introducing the Cyber Trust Mark certification for IoT devices and HIPAA encryption and MFA updates to ensure cyber safety from the top down.On the cybersecurity innovation front, CISA’s launch of Thorium, an open-source platform to help government agencies automate forensic investigations, and AI-enabled threat detection systems have allowed authorities to act on incidents more rapidly, from ransomware affiliate seizures to monitoring AI misuse..North Korea’s DPRK-linked hackers were prolific throughout 2025, stealing over $2B in cryptocurrency, blending traditional heists with espionage campaigns like Operation Contagious Interview targeting remote workers. Similarly, Iranian-linked UNK_SmudgedSerpent and China-linked TA415 campaigns leveraged phishing, fake platforms, and developer tooling to compromise high-value targets, from policy experts to enterprise networks.. VS Code extensions like Bitcoin Black and Codo AI exfiltrated credentials from crypto wallets, while NPM packages such as XORIndex and os-info-checker-es6 delivered multi-stage payloads. Novel malware families including SleepyDuck RAT and Betruger backdoors emerged, masquerading as popular extensions on the Open VSX open-source registry and supporting ransomware campaigns, respectively. Even AI-powered attacks emerged, with AkiraBot, Gamma AI phishing, and social engineering campaigns bypassing CAPTCHAs and traditional defenses to exploit SMBs and enterprise targets.State-aligned and nation-state threat actors also pursued espionage alongside financial crime. Fake job schemes and AI/crypto talent lures enabled targeted malware deployment, while advanced persistent threats like UNC3886 delivered stealthy backdoors to corporate and diplomatic networks. .The “Ugly” dimension of 2025 was . Large ransomware operations like CyberVolk resurfaced with AI-driven VolkLocker, automating negotiation, phishing, and multilingual attacks while leveraging Telegram for orchestration. AI also enhanced the capabilities of smaller, fragmented ransomware crews, allowing rapid targeting and payload deployment, though operational flaws sometimes limited effectiveness.Zero-day vulnerabilities were actively exploited across critical infrastructure and enterprise platforms. React2Shell in React/Next.js, Triofox (CVE-2025-12480), Oracle E-Business Suite (CVE-2025-61884), and ToolShell in SharePoint permitted full system compromise, highlighting that popular frameworks and business-critical software remain high-value targets. Cloud and AI services were similarly exploited; EchoLeak and Google Gemini LLM prompt injections enabled exfiltration of sensitive information without user interaction. .. Iranian-backed Crimson Sandstorm leveraged cyber reconnaissance to support missile strikes, while Chinese and DPRK actors continue to target aid operations, humanitarian NGOs, and government infrastructure, often exploiting IoT, industrial control systems, or open-source software to do so. In cross-border campaigns, long-dwell malware like BRICKSTORM and protocol-level exploits such as MadeYouReset created cascading impacts across critical networks and infrastructure.The risk factor in many attacks this year were amplified by third-party risks. Breaches of Discord vendors, Mixpanel, and GitHub Actions exposed vast quantities of PII and credentials, enabling subsequent ransomware, phishing, or espionage campaigns. .As 2025 draws to a close, one thing is clear: Cybersecurity has become more interconnected, more consequential, and more dependent on collective responsibility than ever before. From supply chain fragility and identity-based intrusion to the continued convergence of cybercrime and geopolitics, the challenges ahead demand deeper collaboration, stronger accountability, and a more deliberate approach to trust across the digital ecosystem.From all of us here at SentinelOne, we wish you a happy, healthy, and secure New Year 2026!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IoT Hack</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/iot-hack.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:02:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Someone hacked an Italian ferry.It looks like the malware was installed by someone on the ferry, and not remotely.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LangGrinch: A Bug in the Library, A Lesson for the Architecture</title><link>https://amlalabs.com/blog/langgrinch-cve-2025-68664/</link><author>/u/hfti</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:37:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On December 23, LangChain published a critical advisory for CVE-2025-68664, nicknamed “LangGrinch.” The Cyata research team discovered a serialization bug in langchain-core that enabled secret exfiltration and arbitrary object instantiation. CVSS 9.3. Patch now if you haven’t.The bug itself was straightforward: LangChain’s  function didn’t escape user-controlled dictionaries containing a reserved  key. When that data later passed through , the deserializer treated attacker-shaped data as internal framework structure.This is a coding mistake. Missing input escaping.But the severity—environment variable exfiltration, including API keys and secrets—came from something else entirely: the framework had ambient access to credentials.Here’s the code path that made this bug catastrophic:The  parameter was  by default. Any deserialized object could resolve environment variables. Combined with the serialization bug, an attacker could:Inject a crafted payload via prompt injection (shaping  or )Let normal framework operations serialize and deserialize that payloadInstantiate , which makes an HTTP request on constructionPopulate an HTTP header with any environment variableExfiltrate secrets to an attacker-controlled endpointThe attacker never directly accessed secrets. They tricked the framework into accessing secrets on their behalf.The Bug vs. The Blast RadiusThe bug was the missing escaping. That’s fixable. LangChain fixed it.The blast radius came from architecture.The serialization bug was the entry point. But an entry point into what? Into a layer that could resolve , , database passwords—anything in the environment.If that layer had no access to secrets, the bug would still exist. Object instantiation might still happen. But the attacker would exfiltrate… nothing.Operating systems learned this lesson decades ago.A bug in a user-space application can crash that application. It cannot directly access kernel memory or hardware because a boundary enforces separation. The application must make a syscall, and the kernel validates before granting access.Now consider the LangChain architecture:LLM output flows directly into framework internals that have ambient access to credentials. No kernel. No boundary. No mediation.When the deserialization got confused by attacker-shaped data, secrets were right there to steal.What Credential Isolation Looks LikeThe alternative architecture separates the agent layer from credential access:The agent layer has no environment variables containing secrets wouldn’t work because there are no secrets in the envTo access a credential, the agent presents a capability token to the gatewayThe gateway verifies the token’s scope before retrieving the credentialEven if the serialization bug happens, the attacker exfiltrates nothingThe bug still exists. The fix is still needed. But the blast radius collapses from “exfiltrate any secret” to “instantiate objects with no sensitive access.”LangChain’s patch introduced several breaking changes: Added escaping for  keys in user-controlled dataRestricted deserialization: New  parameter defaults to Disabled ambient secrets: now defaults to  Jinja2 templates now blocked by defaultThe third change is architecturally significant. It’s an acknowledgment that ambient secret access at the framework layer is dangerous. Better to require explicit opt-in than to assume the framework should resolve credentials by default.This is directionally correct. It doesn’t fully isolate credentials—they’re still in the environment, just not auto-resolved. But it reduces the attack surface.Cyata’s writeup makes this point explicitly:LLM output is an untrusted input. If your framework treats portions of that output as structured objects later, you must assume attackers will try to shape it.This is the architectural lesson. LLM outputs can be influenced by prompt injection. Those outputs flow through framework internals—serialization, caching, streaming, message history. If those internals have access to secrets, prompt injection becomes credential theft.The most common attack vector runs through LLM response fields like  or , which can be shaped via prompt injection and then serialized/deserialized in streaming operations. These fields bridge untrusted LLM output and trusted framework internals.Treating these fields as untrusted is good advice. But it’s defense in depth, not a security boundary. Developers must remember to treat data as untrusted. Code must be audited for every path where untrusted data might touch sensitive operations.A security boundary works differently. It doesn’t ask developers to remember. It makes certain access structurally impossible without proper authorization.LangChain is well-maintained. This bug sat in a heavily-used codebase for two and a half years. Serialization edge cases are notoriously hard to catch. As researcher Yarden Porat noted: “It’s much easier to spot something wrong than to notice something missing, especially when you’re auditing , not .”The question isn’t “how do we prevent all bugs?” It’s “when a bug happens, what can the attacker reach?”If credentials live at the same layer as untrusted data processing, the answer is: everything.If credentials live behind a security boundary, the answer is: only what the compromised layer was authorized to access, which should be nothing sensitive.If you’re running LangChain:Upgrade to  or  immediatelyNote: LangChain.js has a similar vulnerability (CVE-2025-68665, CVSS 8.6)Audit any use of Review flows where LLM output gets serialized/deserializedIf you’re building agent infrastructure:Don’t put credentials in environment variables accessible to the agent layerMediate sensitive operations through a gateway that validates authorizationTreat LLM output as untrusted input at every integration pointIf you’re designing agent architectures:Separate the layers that process untrusted data from the layers that access credentialsBuild the boundary now, before a CVE forces you to retrofit itThanks to the Cyata research team for the detailed writeup and responsible disclosure.
